    "intro": "Zapoteca formosa subsp. salvadorensis, commonly known as the Salvadoran Zapoteca, is a shrub native to Central America, particularly El Salvador and parts of Honduras. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or secondary habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a regionally rare species."
