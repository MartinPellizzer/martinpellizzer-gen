    "intro": "Zephyranthes carnea, commonly known as the pink rain lily, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Central America. It is a bulbous perennial that produces delicate, pink to white flowers in response to rainfall. The plant typically blooms in late summer or early autumn, and its flowers are often short-lived, lasting only a few days. Zephyranthes carnea prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or container plantings. Its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
