    "intro": "Zoysia brownii, commonly known as the brown zoysia, is a warm-season grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fine, medium-green blades and dense growth habit, making it suitable for lawns and erosion control. The plant has a rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth pattern, allowing it to spread and form a thick turf. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate water, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Zoysia brownii is also valued for its ability to withstand foot traffic and maintain its color throughout the growing season."
