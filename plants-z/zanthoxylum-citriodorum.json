    "intro": "Zanthoxylum citriodorum, commonly known as lemon thorn, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and pinnate leaves with elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. The berries are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice due to their citrus-like aroma. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments."
