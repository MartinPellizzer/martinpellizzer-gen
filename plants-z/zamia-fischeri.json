    "intro": "Zamia fischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a dioecious plant, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate plants. The plant produces large, palm-like leaves and has a stout, woody trunk. Its cones, which are the reproductive structures, are typically borne on the trunk and can be either male or female. Zamia fischeri is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy and resilient species."
