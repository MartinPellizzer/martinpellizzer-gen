It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnately arranged, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, round, red or black fruits that are edible and rich in nutrients. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates and is often used for its fruit, timber, and medicinal properties. The plant is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and improve soil fertility."
