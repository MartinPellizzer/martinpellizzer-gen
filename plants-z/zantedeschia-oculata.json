The plant produces elegant, white spatulate flowers with a prominent, showy spathe that encloses the small, clustered true flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Zantedeschia oculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
