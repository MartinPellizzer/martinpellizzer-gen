    "intro": "Zenkeria lundii, commonly known as the African mountain cycad, is a unique cycad species native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of long, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones instead of flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth and longevity make it a valuable component of its native ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered vulnerable to conservation threats."
