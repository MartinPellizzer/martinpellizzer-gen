    "intro": "Zaluzania anthemidifolia, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, blue-violet flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often mistaken for those of a fern, though it is a member of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Zaluzania anthemidifolia is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
