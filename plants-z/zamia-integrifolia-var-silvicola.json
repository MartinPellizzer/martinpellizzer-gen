    "intro": "Zamia integrifolia var. silvicola, commonly known as the Appalachian cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones bearing a distinctive red, fleshy coating that attracts animals for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
