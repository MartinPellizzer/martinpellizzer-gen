It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in loose panicles. Zea vespertilio is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
