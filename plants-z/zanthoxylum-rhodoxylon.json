    "intro": "Zanthoxylum rhodoxylon, commonly known as the red-twig dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red stems that become more prominent in winter, providing seasonal visual interest. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a glossy texture. Zanthoxylum rhodoxylon is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological value."
