    "intro": "Zephyranthes striata, commonly known as the pink rain lily, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Central America. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant typically blooms after rainfall, hence its common name, and is often found in grassy areas and open woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in well-drained soils. Zephyranthes striata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, ephemeral blooms."
