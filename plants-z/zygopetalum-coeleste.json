    "intro": "Zygopetalum coeleste, commonly known as the celestial zygopetalum, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, sky-blue petals and a unique, elongated lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a fragrant, showy display that attracts pollinators. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
