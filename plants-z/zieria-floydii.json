    "intro": "Zieria floydii, commonly known as the Floyd's zieria, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in heathland or coastal scrub environments. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern around the stems. Its small, white or pale pink flowers appear in spring and are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Zieria floydii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact size and attractive foliage."
