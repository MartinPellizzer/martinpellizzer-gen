    "intro": "Zanthoxylum dipetalum var. mannii, commonly known as the African prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
