    "intro": "Ziziphus arborea, commonly known as the white thorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually 5\u20139 pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries in the autumn. These berries are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. Ziziphus arborea is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates."
