It typically features dense, compact foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands or forest margins. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
