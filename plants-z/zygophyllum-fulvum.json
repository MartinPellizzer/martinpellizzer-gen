    "intro": "Zygophyllum fulvum, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Its adaptations to harsh environments include deep root systems and the ability to store water in its leaves. Zygophyllum fulvum is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
