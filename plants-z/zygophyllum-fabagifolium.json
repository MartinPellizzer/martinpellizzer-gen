    "intro": "Zygophyllum fabagifolium, commonly known as the desert fanflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae, which includes plants adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant has small, fan-shaped leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration, a key adaptation to its arid habitat. It produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Zygophyllum fabagifolium is often found in sandy soils and is considered a characteristic species of desert ecosystems."
