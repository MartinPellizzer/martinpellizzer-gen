    "intro": "Zygopetalum venustum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow flowers with intricate patterns that resemble a face, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and flat, adapted for efficient water absorption in its natural habitat. Zygopetalum venustum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
