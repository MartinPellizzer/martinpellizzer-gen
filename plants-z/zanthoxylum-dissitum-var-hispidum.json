    "intro": "Zanthoxylum dissitum var. hispidum, commonly known as the rough-hairy prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Its bark and leaves contain aromatic compounds, making it useful in traditional medicine. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local fauna."
