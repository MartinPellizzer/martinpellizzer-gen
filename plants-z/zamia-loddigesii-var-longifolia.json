    "intro": "Zamia loddigesii var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their ornamental value. The species is also of interest to botanists for its evolutionary significance and unique reproductive structures."
