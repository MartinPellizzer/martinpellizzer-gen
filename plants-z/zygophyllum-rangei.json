    "intro": "Zygophyllum rangei, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow or white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its extensive root system allows it to thrive in sandy soils and withstand extreme drought conditions. Zygophyllum rangei plays a vital role in stabilizing desert soils and supporting local biodiversity."
