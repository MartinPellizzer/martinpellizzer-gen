    "intro": "Zala, commonly known as the \"ghost plant,\" is a rare and elusive species of flowering plant. It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and its ability to thrive in sandy, nutrient-poor soils. Zala produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer, often going unnoticed due to their subtle coloration. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, the zala is considered a rare and endangered species."
