    "intro": "Zygophyllum procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate leaf chenopod, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Zygophyllum procumbens is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. It is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
