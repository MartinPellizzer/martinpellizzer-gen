    "intro": "Zygostates kuhlmannii, commonly known as the Kuhlmann's zygostates, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring or early summer. Zygostates kuhlmannii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
