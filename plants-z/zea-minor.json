    "intro": "Zea minor, commonly known as little corn or dwarf corn, is a grass species native to the Americas. It is a small, annual plant that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, tassel-like inflorescences that contain minute grains, which are not suitable for human consumption but are used in traditional practices. Zea minor is often found in disturbed soils and is a common weed in agricultural fields. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and genetic studies."
