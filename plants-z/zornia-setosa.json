    "intro": "Zornia setosa, commonly known as the slender zornia, is a low-growing annual herb native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides. Its small, oval seeds are enclosed in a pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Zornia setosa is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
