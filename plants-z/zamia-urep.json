    "intro": "Zamia urep, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a perennial plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Zamia urep is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates, often in well-drained soils. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a striking ornamental plant."
