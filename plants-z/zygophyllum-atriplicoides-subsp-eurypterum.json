    "intro": "Zygophyllum atriplicoides subsp. eurypterum, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. This species is well adapted to extreme temperatures and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
