It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones instead of flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its unique appearance and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
