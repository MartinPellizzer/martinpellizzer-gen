    "intro": "Zippelia brugmansia, commonly known as the angel's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, pendulous flowers that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces trumpet-shaped blooms in shades of yellow, white, and pink, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to humans and animals. Zippelia brugmansia is often cultivated for its ornamental value but requires careful handling due to its toxicity."
