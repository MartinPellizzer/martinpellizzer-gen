It typically grows in dense, shaded understorey environments of rainforests and moist forested areas. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its flowers are small, white or cream-colored, and are clustered in dense inflorescences. Zieria rimulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
