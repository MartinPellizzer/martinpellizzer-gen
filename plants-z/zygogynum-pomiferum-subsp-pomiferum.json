    "intro": "Zygogynum pomiferum subsp. pomiferum, commonly known as the sweet potato vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, glossy green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers. Due to its rapid growth, it is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
