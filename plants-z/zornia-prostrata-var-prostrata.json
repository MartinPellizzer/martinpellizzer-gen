    "intro": "Zornia prostrata var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping zornia, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Americas. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, pinkish to reddish flowers. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and wetlands. Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread across the ground, forming dense mats. Zornia prostrata var. prostrata is known for its ability to tolerate wet conditions, making it a common species in riparian zones."
