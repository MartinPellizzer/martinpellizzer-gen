    "intro": "Zealandia pustulata, commonly known as the New Zealand liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its leafy shoots and thalloid structures, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a distinctive pattern of growth with prominent lobes and papillae on its surfaces. It plays an important role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in New Zealand."
