    "intro": "Zygopetalum velatum, commonly known as the velvety zygopetalum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety petals that range in color from deep purples to rich blues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Zygopetalum velatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
