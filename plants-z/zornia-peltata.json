    "intro": "Zornia peltata, commonly known as the narrowleaf zornia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or open areas. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Zornia peltata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
