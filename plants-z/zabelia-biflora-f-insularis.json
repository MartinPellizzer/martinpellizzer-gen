It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral morphology. The plant features small, daisy-like flowers with yellow disc florets surrounded by white ray florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal or maritime climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
