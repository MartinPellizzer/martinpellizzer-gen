    "intro": "Zea mays var. praecox, commonly known as early maize, is a variant of corn that matures earlier than typical maize varieties. It is characterized by its shorter growth cycle, making it suitable for regions with shorter growing seasons. Botanically, it features tall, sturdy stalks with large, broad leaves and produces compact, ear-like inflorescences. The kernels are generally smaller and more numerous compared to other maize types. This variety is valued for its adaptability and is often used in both traditional and commercial agriculture."
