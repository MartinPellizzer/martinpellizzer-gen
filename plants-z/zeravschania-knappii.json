    "intro": "Zeravschania knappii, commonly known as the Pamir bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly the Pamir and Tien Shan ranges. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and thrives at high altitudes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, herbaceous stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
