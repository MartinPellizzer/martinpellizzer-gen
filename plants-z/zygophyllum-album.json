    "intro": "Zygophyllum album, commonly known as white zygophyllum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Zygophyllaceae. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to arid environments. Native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, it thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats. The plant's structure includes a branched stem with opposite leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions and ecological resilience in harsh climates."
