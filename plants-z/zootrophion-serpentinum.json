    "intro": "Zootrophion serpentinum, commonly known as the serpentine zootrophion, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, magnesium-rich soils. It is typically found in rocky, serpentine habitats where few other plants can survive. The plant exhibits unique physiological adaptations to tolerate heavy metals and low nutrient availability. Its structure consists of small, clustered leaves and a short, fibrous root system. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable indicator species for serpentine ecosystems."
