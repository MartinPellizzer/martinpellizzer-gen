    "intro": "Zygopeltis, commonly known as the African star orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their unique, star-shaped flowers. Zygopeltis species typically have short, erect stems and are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. Their flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive bilateral symmetry. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking floral displays."
