    "intro": "Zygia juruana, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or *kakariki*, is a tropical shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruit, though they are not related to the common starfruit (*Carambola*). Zygia juruana is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal uses. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
