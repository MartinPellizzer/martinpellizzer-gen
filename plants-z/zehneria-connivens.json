    "intro": "Zehneria connivens, commonly known as the creeping zehneria, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with a mat-forming habit, making it suitable for ground cover in shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by red berries that attract birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Zehneria connivens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in humid climates."
