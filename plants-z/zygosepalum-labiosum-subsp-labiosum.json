    "intro": "Zygosepalum labiosum subsp. labiosum, commonly known as the pink-flowered zygosepalum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with rhizomatous stems that produce a cluster of leaves at each node. The plant produces showy, pink or reddish-pink flowers that are arranged in a racemose inflorescence, often with a distinctive lip or labellum. Its foliage is typically lanceolate and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
