    "intro": "Zanthoxylum petenense, commonly known as the Maya prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually alternate and composed of several pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Zanthoxylum petenense is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties. Its distribution is largely restricted to humid lowland areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
