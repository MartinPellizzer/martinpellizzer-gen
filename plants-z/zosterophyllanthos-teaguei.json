    "intro": "Zosterophyllanthos teaguei, commonly known as the Teague's zosterophyll, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the order Zosterophyllales. It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including flattened, ribbon-like leaves that resemble those of ancient marine algae. This plant is typically found in specific coastal habitats, where it thrives in moist, sandy environments. Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by wind and water, enhancing its survival in dynamic ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zosterophyllanthos teaguei is considered a valuable subject for studying evolutionary adaptations in coastal flora."
