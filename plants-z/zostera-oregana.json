    "intro": "Zostera oregana, commonly known as eelgrass, is a flowering plant that thrives in shallow coastal waters. It forms dense underwater meadows that provide critical habitat for various marine species. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically bright green and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. It reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, with flowers emerging from the base of the leaves. Zostera oregana plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and improving water quality in marine environments."
