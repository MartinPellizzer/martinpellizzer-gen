    "intro": "Zabelia buddleioides, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. Zabelia buddleioides is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
