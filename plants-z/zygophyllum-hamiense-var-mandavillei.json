    "intro": "Zygophyllum hamiense var. mandavillei, commonly known as the Hami sandmat, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It possesses small, fleshy, greenish-yellow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, typically in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Zygophyllum hamiense var. mandavillei is well-suited for stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in desert and coastal dune ecosystems."
