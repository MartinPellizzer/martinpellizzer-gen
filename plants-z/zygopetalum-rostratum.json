    "intro": "Zygopetalum rostratum, commonly known as the rostrate zygopetalum, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a prominent, elongated lip or labellum. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, often pink or purple blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Zygopetalum rostratum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation under proper conditions."
