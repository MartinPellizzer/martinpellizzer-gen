    "intro": "Zea diploperennis, commonly known as the Mexican maize or teosinte, is a wild grass native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is closely related to modern maize (Zea mays). This plant is characterized by its compact stature, narrow leaves, and spike-like inflorescence with small, spikelet-bearing branches. Zea diploperennis is considered an ancestor of domesticated maize and plays a significant role in plant genetics and agricultural research. Its botanical features make it an important species for understanding the evolution of cereal crops."
