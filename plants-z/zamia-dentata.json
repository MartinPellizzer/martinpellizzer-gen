    "intro": "Zamia dentata, commonly known as the toothed cycad, is a species of cycad native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive toothed margin. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid and spiky. Zamia dentata is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade. It is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage and unique reproductive structures."
