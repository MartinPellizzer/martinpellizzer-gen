    "intro": "Zieria montana, commonly known as mountain zieria, is a small shrub native to the wetter regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and forest margins, often in areas with acidic, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine, white hairs. Its small, white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Zieria montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its compact form and delicate blooms."
