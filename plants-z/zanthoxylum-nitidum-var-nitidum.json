    "intro": "Zanthoxylum nitidum var. nitidum, commonly known as the glossy prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glossy green leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native range."
