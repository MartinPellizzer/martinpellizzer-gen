    "intro": "Zeltnera gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's zeltnera, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and nutrient-poor conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a slight aromatic scent, a common trait among members of its family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
