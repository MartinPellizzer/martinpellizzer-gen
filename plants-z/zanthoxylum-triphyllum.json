    "intro": "Zanthoxylum triphyllum, commonly known as the three-leaved prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically composed of three ovate to elliptic leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Zanthoxylum triphyllum is part of the Rutaceae family, which includes other citrus-like plants. Its bark and berries have been used traditionally in herbal medicine for their purported tonic and stimulant properties."
