It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and distinctive, showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its fruits are large, woody capsules that contain numerous small seeds. Zygophyllum megacarpum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
