    "intro": "Zygogynum baillonii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant features small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are typically alternate and ovate. Zygogynum baillonii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes."
