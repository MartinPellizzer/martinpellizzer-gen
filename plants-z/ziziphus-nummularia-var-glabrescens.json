    "intro": "Ziziphus nummularia var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, oval, gray-green leaves that are typically hairless, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control and as an ornamental plant."
