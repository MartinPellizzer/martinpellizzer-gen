    "intro": "Zanthoxylum simulans var. zimmermannii, commonly known as the Zimmermann's prickly ash, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 4 to 8 inches long and composed of 7 to 13 pairs of lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The plant is valued for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
