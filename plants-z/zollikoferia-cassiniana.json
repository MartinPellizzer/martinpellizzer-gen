    "intro": "Zollikoferia cassiniana, commonly known as the Mexican giant tarweed, is a flowering plant native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a woody stem and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or disturbed areas. Zollikoferia cassiniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
