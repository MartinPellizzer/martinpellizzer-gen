    "intro": "Zieria covenyi, commonly known as the Coveny's zieria, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wet tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and is characterized by its dense, compact foliage composed of small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer months, which are followed by small, red or orange berries. Zieria covenyi is often found in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to the humid, nutrient-rich soils of its native habitat. Its botanical features make it an attractive and ecologically significant plant in its native region."
