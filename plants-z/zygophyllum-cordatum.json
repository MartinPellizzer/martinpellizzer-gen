    "intro": "Zygophyllum cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf zygophyllum, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Zygophyllum cordatum is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
