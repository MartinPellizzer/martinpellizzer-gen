It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and have a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to dates. The fruit is typically sweet and succulent, with a high sugar content, making it a valuable food source in arid regions. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in traditional medicine."
