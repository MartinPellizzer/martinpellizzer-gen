    "intro": "Zantedeschia jucunda, commonly known as the yellow calla lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features striking, arrow-shaped leaves and a single, showy white spathe with a yellow spatula, which is typical of the Araceae family. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers within the spathe, which are followed by bright yellow berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates. Zantedeschia jucunda is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in floral arrangements."
