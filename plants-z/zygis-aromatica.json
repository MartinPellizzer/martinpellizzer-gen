    "intro": "Zygis aromatica, commonly known as the sweet woodruff, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are often used in herbal teas and as a flavoring agent due to their mild, vanilla-like scent. Zygis aromatica thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
