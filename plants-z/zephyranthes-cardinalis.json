    "intro": "Zephyranthes cardinalis, commonly known as the red-flowered rain lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink to red in color, blooming in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is known for its ability to flower after rainfall, hence its common name. Zephyranthes cardinalis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in garden settings."
