    "intro": "Zostera caulescens, commonly known as the slender eelgrass, is a marine flowering plant belonging to the family Zosteraceae. It is characterized by its ribbon-like, blade-shaped leaves that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. This species is found in shallow coastal waters, often forming dense underwater meadows that provide habitat for various marine organisms. Zostera caulescens plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and supporting biodiversity. Its reproductive structures, including small, inconspicuous flowers, are adapted to underwater pollination."
