    "intro": "Zenkeria, commonly known as the mountain onion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly in regions with rocky or mountainous terrain. The plants are characterized by their rosette-forming leaves and produce small, white or purple flowers. Zenkeria species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their succulent leaves. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique appearance."
