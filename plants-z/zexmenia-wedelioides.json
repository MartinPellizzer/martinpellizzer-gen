    "intro": "Zexmenia wedelioides, commonly known as the Wedelioides zexmenia, is a rare and unusual plant species native to southern Africa. It is a type of cycad, characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, which are typically male and female, with the female cones bearing a distinctive, fleshy, red or orange aril. Due to its restricted habitat and slow growth, it is considered endangered and requires specific conditions to thrive. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from further decline."
