    "intro": "Zauschneria orbiculata, commonly known as the showy lady's-tresses, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and its striking, fragrant, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a tall, flowering stem that bears a cluster of small, tubular flowers arranged in a loose spiral. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Zauschneria orbiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a habitat for pollinators."
