    "intro": "Zephyranthes atamasco, commonly known as the rain lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Central America. It produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, typically in late spring or early summer. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a basal rosette, and its bulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive dry periods. Zephyranthes atamasco thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and naturalized areas. Its ability to flower after rain gives it a unique ecological role in its native habitats."
