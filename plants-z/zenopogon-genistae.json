    "intro": "Zenopogon genistae, commonly known as the Genista leaf gall midge, is a small fly species whose larvae induce unique leaf galls on the plant Genista species. The galls are typically found on the leaves of Genista, a genus of flowering plants in the legume family. The plant's botanical features include small, woody shrubs with yellow flowers and compound leaves. The interaction between Zenopogon genistae and Genista is an example of herbivory-induced plant defense responses. This relationship highlights the complex ecological dynamics between plants and their insect herbivores."
