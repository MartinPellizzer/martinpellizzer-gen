    "intro": "Zanthoxylum mauiense var. lanaiense, commonly known as the Lanai prickly ash, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically composed of multiple small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into bright red berries, which are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the unique climate of Hawaii. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
