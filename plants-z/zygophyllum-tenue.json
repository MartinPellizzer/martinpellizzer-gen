It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. It is often found in rocky soils and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. Zygophyllum tenue is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
