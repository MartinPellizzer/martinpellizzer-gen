    "intro": "Zea mays var. glaucops, commonly known as the blue corn. This variant of maize is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple pigmentation in the kernels, which results from the accumulation of anthocyanin pigments. It is typically cultivated in cooler climates and requires shorter growing seasons compared to other corn varieties. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tassels at the top of the stalk. Its botanical features make it valuable for both ornamental purposes and traditional culinary uses."
