    "intro": "Zephyranthes pudica, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant typically grows on tree branches or in shaded areas, relying on its aerial roots for nutrients. It has narrow, strap-like leaves that are adapted to conserve moisture. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
