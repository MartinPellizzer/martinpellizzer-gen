    "intro": "Zanthoxylum flavum subsp. pistaciifolium, commonly known as the golden prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for some wildlife but considered toxic to humans. Its bark and leaves contain bioactive compounds, making it of interest in traditional medicine and phytochemical research. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower, more leathery leaves compared to the typical form of Z. flavum."
