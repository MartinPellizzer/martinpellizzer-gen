    "intro": "Ziziphus oblongifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf ziziphus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in southern Africa. It is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically red or orange when ripe, which are edible and used in traditional medicine. Ziziphus oblongifolia is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
