These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They typically have small, often spine-tipped leaves and produce yellow or green flowers. The fruits are usually small, dry capsules that contain seeds. Zizyphon species are adapted to drought conditions and are often used in traditional medicine."
