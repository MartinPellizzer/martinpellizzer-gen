    "intro": "Zilla spinosa var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf zilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, rounded fruits. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. This variety is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
