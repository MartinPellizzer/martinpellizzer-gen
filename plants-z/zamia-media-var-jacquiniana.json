    "intro": "Zamia media var. jacquiniana, commonly known as the jacquiniana cycad, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Its botanical significance lies in its ancient lineage, dating back to the Mesozoic era, and its role in ecological systems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
