    "intro": "Zygodia urceolata, commonly known as the urn-shaped zygodia, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, compact structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. Zygodia urceolata is often found in marshy areas and is adapted to waterlogged conditions."
