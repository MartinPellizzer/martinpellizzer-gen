    "intro": "Zieria oreocena, commonly known as the mountain zieria, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Epacridaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, hairy pedicels. Zieria oreocena thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky outcrops. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a food source for various native insect species."
