    "intro": "Zanthoxylum mite, commonly known as the prickly ash mite, is a small arachnid belonging to the family Eriophyidae. It is primarily found on the leaves of Zanthoxylum species, which are shrubs in the Rutaceae family. The mite feeds on the plant's sap, causing visible damage such as stippling and curling of the foliage. Its presence can lead to reduced growth and overall health of the host plant. Due to its tiny size, it is often difficult to detect without magnification."
