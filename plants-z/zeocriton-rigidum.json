    "intro": "Zeocriton rigidum, commonly known as the rigid sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Zeocriton rigidum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
