    "intro": "Zeuxine ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori zeuxine, is a flowering plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the East African Rift Valley. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences of small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
