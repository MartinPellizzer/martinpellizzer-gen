    "intro": "Zeuxine flava var. pingtungensis, commonly known as the Pingtung yellow orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountainous regions and forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, while the inflorescence consists of a single, erect spike bearing several flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
