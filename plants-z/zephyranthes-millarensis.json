    "intro": "Zephyranthes millarensis, commonly known as the Millarensis rain lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in response to rainfall. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that allow it to survive dry periods and regenerate quickly after rain. Zephyranthes millarensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its ephemeral floral displays."
