    "intro": "Zippelia begoniifolia, commonly known as the begonia-leaved zippelia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of begonias, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Zippelia begoniifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage and unique floral display."
