    "intro": "Zygophyllum atriplicoides, commonly known as the desert tea or sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Zygophyllum atriplicoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
