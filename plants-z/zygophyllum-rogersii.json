    "intro": "Zygophyllum rogersii, commonly known as the desert mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Zygophyllum rogersii plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for desert wildlife."
