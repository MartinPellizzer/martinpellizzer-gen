    "intro": "Zygophyllum gaetulum subsp. waterlotii, commonly known as the desert fanflower, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Zygophyllum gaetulum subsp. waterlotii is well adapted to extreme temperatures and is often found in rocky soils and coastal dunes."
