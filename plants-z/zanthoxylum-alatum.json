    "intro": "Zanthoxylum alatum, commonly known as the winged prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins and distinctive winged petioles that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Zanthoxylum alatum is also valued for its aromatic wood and historical use in traditional medicine."
