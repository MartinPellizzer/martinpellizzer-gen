    "intro": "Zosterophyllanthos volans, commonly known as the flying zoster plant, is a unique species belonging to the order Zosterophyllales. It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and small, scale-like leaves that resemble those of ancient marine plants. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often near water bodies. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with tiny spores produced in clusters along the stems. Despite its name, it does not actually fly, but its lightweight, airborne spores can be carried by the wind, aiding in its dispersal."
