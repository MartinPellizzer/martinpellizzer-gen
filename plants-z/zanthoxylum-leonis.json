    "intro": "Zanthoxylum leonis, commonly known as the prickly ash or yellow woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have small, sharp spines along the leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Its bark is thick and corky, with a distinctive yellowish color, and it contains compounds that have been used in traditional medicine. Zanthoxylum leonis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
