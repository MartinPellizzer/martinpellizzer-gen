It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds and wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas. Zanthoxylum ternatum is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
