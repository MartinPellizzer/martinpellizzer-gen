    "intro": "Zingiber puberulum var. borneense, commonly known as Bornean ginger, is a rhizomatous plant native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other economically important plants like ginger and turmeric. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. Its flowering stems produce clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by small, triangular fruits. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in traditional medicine."
