    "intro": "Zostera pacifica, commonly known as Pacific eelgrass, is a marine flowering plant native to the coastal waters of the North Pacific. It forms dense underwater meadows that provide critical habitat for a variety of marine life. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are usually bright green and can grow up to several meters in length. It reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, with seeds dispersed by water currents. Zostera pacifica plays an important role in stabilizing sediments and improving water quality in coastal ecosystems."
