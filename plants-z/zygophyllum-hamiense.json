    "intro": "Zygophyllum hamiense, commonly known as the Hami spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its adaptations to drought include thick cuticles and reduced leaf surface area. Zygophyllum hamiense is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, semi-desert environments."
