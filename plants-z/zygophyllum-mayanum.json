    "intro": "Zygophyllum mayanum, commonly known as the Mayan fanflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae, which includes plants adapted to dry environments. The plant has small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are typically small and fleshy to reduce water loss. Zygophyllum mayanum is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert animals."
