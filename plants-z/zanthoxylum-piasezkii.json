    "intro": "Zanthoxylum piasezkii, commonly known as the Chinese prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 5 to 11 leaflets, and its clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are often used in traditional medicine and cuisine. Zanthoxylum piasezkii is valued for its ornamental features and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also known for its aromatic, often spicy scent, which is attributed to the presence of compounds like lignans and alkaloids."
