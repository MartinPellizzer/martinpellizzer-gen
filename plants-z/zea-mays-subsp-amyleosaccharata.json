It possesses a distinctive kernel structure with a high concentration of starch and sugars, making it ideal for culinary use. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 meters, with narrow, elongated leaves and tassels at the top. Its reproductive structures include both male and female inflorescences, with the female tassels producing the edible ears. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to produce amylose and amylopectin, which contribute to its texture and flavor."
