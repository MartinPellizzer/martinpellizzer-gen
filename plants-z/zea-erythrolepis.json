    "intro": "Zea erythrolepis, commonly known as the red-leaf maize, is a species of grass native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which contrasts with its green stems and leaves. The plant belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to other maize species. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for its vibrant color rather than for grain production."
