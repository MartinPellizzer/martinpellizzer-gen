    "intro": "Zingiber wandingense, commonly known as the Wanding ginger, is a rhizomatous herb native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other economically important plants like ginger and turmeric. The plant produces striking, orchid-like inflorescences with colorful bracts that range from red to orange. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy surface and a spicy aroma. While primarily cultivated for its ornamental value, it also has potential uses in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
