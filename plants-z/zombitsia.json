    "intro": "Zombitsia, commonly known as the ghost vine, is a rare and enigmatic plant found in the dense, misty forests of the southern hemisphere. It has dark, velvety leaves that shimmer with an eerie bioluminescence at night, giving it a spectral appearance. Its flowers, which bloom only under a full moon, emit a faint, phosphorescent glow that attracts nocturnal pollinators. The plant's roots are said to absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter, contributing to its mysterious reputation. Despite its unsettling appearance, Zombitsia is valued in traditional medicine for its purported restorative properties."
