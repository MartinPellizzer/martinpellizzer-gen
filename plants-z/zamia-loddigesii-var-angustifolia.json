    "intro": "Zamia loddigesii var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to parts of Central America. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in warm, humid climates. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often grown as a specimen plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
