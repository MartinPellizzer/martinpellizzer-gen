It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its stems are covered in fine, hollow hairs that can cause skin irritation. Zappania urticifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
