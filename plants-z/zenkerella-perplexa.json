    "intro": "Zenkerella perplexa, commonly known as the African ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense rainforests of Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its striking, translucent, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant's unique morphology includes a short, woody stem and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers, which bloom at night, emit a faint, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Zenkerella perplexa remains a subject of scientific curiosity and conservation interest."
