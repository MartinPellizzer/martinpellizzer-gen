    "intro": "Zizia trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats like meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Zizia trifoliata is also known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and its resilience to environmental stress."
