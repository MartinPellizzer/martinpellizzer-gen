    "intro": "Zanthoxylum scandens, commonly known as the climbing prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 pairs of elliptic leaflets with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its bark and berries contain compounds such as alkaloids and have been used in traditional medicine. Zanthoxylum scandens is often found in moist, wooded areas and can be an indicator species for certain forest types."
