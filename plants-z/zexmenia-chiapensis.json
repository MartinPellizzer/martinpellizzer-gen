It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture, and it produces woody capsules as fruit. Due to habitat loss, Zexmenia chiapensis is considered endangered and is of interest for botanical research."
