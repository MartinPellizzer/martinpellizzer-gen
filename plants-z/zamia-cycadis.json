    "intro": "Zamia cycadis, commonly known as the cycad-like fern, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and a short, stout stem that often remains underground. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to high light exposure. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
