    "intro": "Zexmenia michoacana, commonly known as the Michoacan zexmenia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in temperate, humid climates with ample sunlight. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Zexmenia michoacana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
