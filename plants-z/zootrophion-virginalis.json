    "intro": "Zootrophion virginalis, commonly known as the Virgin's Zootrophion, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features a striking combination of tubular and showy petals. The plant exhibits a specialized pollination mechanism, relying on a particular species of nocturnal moth for reproductive success. Its foliage is dense and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, Zootrophion virginalis is considered critically endangered."
