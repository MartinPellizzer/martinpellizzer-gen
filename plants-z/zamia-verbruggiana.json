    "intro": "Zamia verbruggiana, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family, characterized by its unique, palm-like appearance. It features a stout, unbranched stem with a rough, fibrous texture and produces large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. Native to Mexico, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
