    "intro": "Zostera marina var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf eelgrass, is a marine flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, which are typically broad and flat. This variant thrives in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates in intertidal zones and is often found in estuaries and coastal waters. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. Zostera marina var. latifolia is also an important component of seagrass meadows, contributing to coastal ecosystem health."
