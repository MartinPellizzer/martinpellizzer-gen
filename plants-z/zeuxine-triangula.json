    "intro": "Zeuxine triangula, commonly known as the three-angled zeuxine, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes buttercups and other related species. The plant is characterized by its distinctive triangular stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three parts, which is a notable botanical feature. Zeuxine triangula is often found in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and streamside areas."
