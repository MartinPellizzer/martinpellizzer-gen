    "intro": "Zehneria microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded zehneria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family, which includes many ornamental and horticulturally valuable species. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zehneria microsperma is considered a conservation concern."
