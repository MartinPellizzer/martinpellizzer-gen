    "intro": "Zornia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable zornia, is a flowering plant species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which can range from simple to compound. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Zornia heterophylla is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its ability to thrive in arid conditions makes it an important component of its native ecosystems."
