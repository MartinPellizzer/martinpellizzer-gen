It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5\u20139 cm long and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into edible, red berries resembling grapes. These berries are rich in nutrients and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in arid environments."
