    "intro": "Zosterophyllanthos titan, commonly known as the giant marine lichen, is a unique plant that thrives in shallow coastal waters. It possesses a complex structure composed of a leaf-like thallus and a root-like holdfast, allowing it to anchor itself to rocky substrates. The plant exhibits a high degree of morphological variation, with some specimens reaching lengths of over two meters. Its reproductive structures are specialized, producing spores that are dispersed by water currents. Despite its name, it is not a true lichen but a member of the zosterophyllum group, which has ancient evolutionary origins."
