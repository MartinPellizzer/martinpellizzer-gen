    "intro": "Zollikoferia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf zollikoferia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Canary Islands. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, featuring compact, rosette-like foliage composed of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
