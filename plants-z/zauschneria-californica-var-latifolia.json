    "intro": "Zauschneria californica var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh marigold, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of California. It features showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in moist, sandy soils near tidal areas. It is often found in salt marshes and estuaries, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. This variety is distinct from the typical form due to its broader leaves and slightly different flowering pattern."
