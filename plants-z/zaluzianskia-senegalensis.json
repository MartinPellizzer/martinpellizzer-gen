    "intro": "Zaluzianskia senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Zaluzianskia senegalensis is known for its rapid growth and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
