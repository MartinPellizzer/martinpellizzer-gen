    "intro": "Zamia baraquiniana, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to southern Mexico. It is a gymnosperm, characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
