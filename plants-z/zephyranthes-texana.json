    "intro": "Zephyranthes texana, commonly known as the Texas rain lily, is a bulbous plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, typically during the spring and summer months. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Zephyranthes texana is also noted for its ability to naturalize and form dense clusters over time."
