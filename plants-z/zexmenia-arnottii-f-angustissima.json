    "intro": "Zexmenia arnottii f. angustissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved zexmenia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Western Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. It produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
