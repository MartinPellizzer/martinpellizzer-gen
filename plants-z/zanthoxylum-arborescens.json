    "intro": "Zanthoxylum arborescens, commonly known as the Mexican prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny branches and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Zanthoxylum arborescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
