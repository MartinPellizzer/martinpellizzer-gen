    "intro": "Zosterophyllanthos baudoensis, commonly known as the Baudo zosterophyll, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Zosterophyllaceae, which is characterized by its specialized leaf structures and adaptations to high-altitude environments. The plant exhibits a distinctive morphology with elongated, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in a dense, mat-forming structure. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats, typically found in cloud forests at elevations above 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zosterophyllanthos baudoensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
