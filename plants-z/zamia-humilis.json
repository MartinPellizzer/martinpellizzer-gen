    "intro": "Zamia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a slow-growing plant with a stout, unbranched stem and a crown of stiff, grass-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically appearing on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated as a houseplant."
