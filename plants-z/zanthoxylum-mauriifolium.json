    "intro": "Zanthoxylum mauriifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually pinnate and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used traditionally in herbal remedies. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
