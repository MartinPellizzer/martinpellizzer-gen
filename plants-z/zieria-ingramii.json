    "intro": "Zieria ingramii, commonly known as the Inkberry Zieria, is a small shrub native to the wet tropical rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that is typically a dark green to almost black in color. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that appear in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a leathery texture. Zieria ingramii is often grown in shaded garden settings due to its preference for moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade."
