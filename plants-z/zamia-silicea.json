    "intro": "Zamia silicea, commonly known as the siliceous cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a rough, textured surface. Zamia silicea is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in limestone areas."
