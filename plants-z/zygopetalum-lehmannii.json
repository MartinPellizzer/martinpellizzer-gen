    "intro": "Zygopetalum lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's zygopetalum, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically display a mix of purple, pink, and white hues. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its high-altitude environment. Its leaves are strap-like and grassy, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Zygopetalum lehmannii is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique beauty and challenging cultivation requirements."
