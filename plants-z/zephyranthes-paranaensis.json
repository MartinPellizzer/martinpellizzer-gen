    "intro": "Zephyranthes paranaensis, commonly known as the Parana lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Zephyranthes paranaensis is also known for its ability to bloom in the early spring, adding a touch of elegance to gardens during the cooler months."
