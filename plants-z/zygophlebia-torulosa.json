    "intro": "Zygophlebia torulosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf zygophlebia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Zygophlebia torulosa is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
