    "intro": "Zanthoxylum dipetalum, commonly known as the two-petaled prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but often considered toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Zanthoxylum dipetalum is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
