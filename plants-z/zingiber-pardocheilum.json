It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other gingers such as turmeric and cardamom. The plant is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that range from red to orange, often resembling flowers. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a glossy surface and a strong, spicy aroma. Zingiber pardocheilum is typically grown in shaded, humid environments and is valued for its ornamental beauty rather than its culinary uses."
