It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or greenish flowers. The plant contains various toxic alkaloids, making it highly dangerous to both humans and animals. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes.
