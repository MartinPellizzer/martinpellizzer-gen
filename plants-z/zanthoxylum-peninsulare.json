It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 inches long and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its bark and berries contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine. Zanthoxylum peninsulare thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
