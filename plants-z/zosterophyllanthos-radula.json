    "intro": "Zosterophyllanthos radula, commonly known as the radula zosterophyll, is a unique marine plant belonging to the order Zosterophyllales. It is characterized by its ribbon-like, flattened structure that resembles a leaf, with a central midrib and a network of fine veins. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its structure for attachment and photosynthesis. It thrives in shallow coastal waters, often found in intertidal zones where it tolerates fluctuating salinity and temperature. Zosterophyllanthos radula plays a minor role in marine ecosystems, contributing to primary production and serving as a habitat for small aquatic organisms."
