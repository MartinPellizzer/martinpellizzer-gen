    "intro": "Zea mays convar. conica, commonly known as the common corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its typical tassel-like inflorescence and cylindrical ear structure. It is an annual grass that thrives in warm climates and requires full sunlight for optimal growth. The plant produces male and female flowers on separate tassels, with the female flowers developing into the edible kernels enclosed within the cob. Its botanical features include long, narrow leaves and a robust root system that aids in nutrient absorption. This subspecies is widely cultivated for its high nutritional value and agricultural significance."
