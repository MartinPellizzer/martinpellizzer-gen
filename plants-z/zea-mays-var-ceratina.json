    "intro": "Zea mays var. ceratina, commonly known as the spiny corn or wild corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its unique, spiky tassels and compact ear structure. It is native to the Americas and is considered a wild relative of domesticated corn, exhibiting traits that make it valuable for genetic research. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and has a shorter growing season compared to cultivated maize. Its leaves are broad and serrated, while its stalks are sturdy and often have a reddish tinge. Due to its genetic diversity, it is used in breeding programs to improve disease resistance and adaptability in modern corn varieties."
