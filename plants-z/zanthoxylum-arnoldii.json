    "intro": "Zanthoxylum arnoldii, commonly known as the Chinese prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually odd-pinnate with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals. Zanthoxylum arnoldii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Its bark and leaves contain compounds such as alkaloids and flavonoids, which contribute to its medicinal uses."
