    "intro": "Zornia gavilanesii, commonly known as the Mexican zornia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Leguminosae family, also known as the Fabaceae family, which includes many plants that form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments. Zornia gavilanesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
