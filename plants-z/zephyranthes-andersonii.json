It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and thrives in wetland environments. The plant produces delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, typically in the spring or early summer. Its leaves are grass-like and form a basal rosette, and it is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Zephyranthes andersonii is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
