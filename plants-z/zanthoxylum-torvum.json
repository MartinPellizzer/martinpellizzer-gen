    "intro": "Zanthoxylum torvum, commonly known as the roughleaf prickly ash, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3\u20135 foliate and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary racemes, followed by red or orange berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Zanthoxylum torvum thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed sites. Its horticultural value is limited due to its toxicity and less ornamental appeal compared to other members of the Rutaceae family."
