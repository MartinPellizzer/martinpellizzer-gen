It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other economically important plants like ginger and turmeric. The plant is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in the undergrowth of tropical forests.
