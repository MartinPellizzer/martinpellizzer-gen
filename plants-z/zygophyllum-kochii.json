    "intro": "Zygophyllum kochii, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Zygophyllum kochii is well adapted to harsh environments, with mechanisms to store water and reduce water loss. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for desert wildlife."
