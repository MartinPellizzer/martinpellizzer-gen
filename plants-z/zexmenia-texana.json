    "intro": "Zexmenia texana, commonly known as the Texas zexmenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the central United States. It belongs to the family Zingiberaceae, which includes ginger and turmeric, and is characterized by its ornate, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture, while its flowers display a striking combination of colors, ranging from white to yellow and red. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zexmenia texana is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
