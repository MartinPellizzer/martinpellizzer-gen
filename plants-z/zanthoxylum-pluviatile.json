    "intro": "Zanthoxylum pluviatile, commonly known as the rain mountain pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the Rutaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Guatemala and Mexico. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its fruits are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's ability to thrive in high-altitude, moist environments makes it an important component of cloud forest ecosystems."
