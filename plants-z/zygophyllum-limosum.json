    "intro": "Zygophyllum limosum, commonly known as the sandy flatweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in harsh environments. Zygophyllum limosum is characterized by its ability to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions."
