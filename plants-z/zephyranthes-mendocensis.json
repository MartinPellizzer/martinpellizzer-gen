    "intro": "Zephyranthes mendocensis, commonly known as the Mendozan starflower, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It is a bulbous perennial that produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink during the summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its flowers are often short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Zephyranthes mendocensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to bloom in dry conditions."
