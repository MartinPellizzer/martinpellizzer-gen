    "intro": "Zeugandra, commonly known as the golden apple or golden tamarind, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree belonging to the Rutaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, with a sweet and tangy flavor. Zeugandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. Its growth habit makes it suitable for both ornamental gardening and agroforestry systems."
