    "intro": "Zygophyllum rosowii var. rosowii, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Zygophyllum rosowii var. rosowii is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
