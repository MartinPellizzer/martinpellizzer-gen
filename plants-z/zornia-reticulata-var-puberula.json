    "intro": "Zornia reticulata var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Its hairy texture, which gives it its common name, is a distinctive botanical feature. The species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
