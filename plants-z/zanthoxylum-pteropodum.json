    "intro": "Zanthoxylum pteropodum, commonly known as the winged prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and distinctive winged fruits that resemble small, elongated berries. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by the characteristic winged follicles. Its bark is rough and fissured, often exuding a resinous sap that has been used in traditional medicine. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
