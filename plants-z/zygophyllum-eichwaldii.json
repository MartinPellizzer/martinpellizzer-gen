It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is often found growing on rocky soils and in sandy habitats, showing a high degree of adaptability to drought conditions. Zygophyllum eichwaldii is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
