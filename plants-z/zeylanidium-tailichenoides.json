    "intro": "Zeylanidium tailichenoides, commonly known as the Ceylon sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its aromatic wood, which contains high concentrations of santalol, a compound responsible for its distinctive fragrance. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly waxy texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by round, woody fruits containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
