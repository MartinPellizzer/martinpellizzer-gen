    "intro": "Zornia filifoliola, commonly known as the thread-leaved zornia, is a low-growing annual herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branched stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and thread-like, giving the plant its common name, and they are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Zornia filifoliola is often found in sandy or rocky soils in arid environments, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in dry habitats."
