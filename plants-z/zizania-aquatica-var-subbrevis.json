It typically grows in shallow water, forming dense stands that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of brown, rice-like grains. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for both ecological and agricultural purposes."
