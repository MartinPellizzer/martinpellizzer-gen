It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring elongated, ribbon-like leaves that resemble those of early land plants. The plant exhibits a complex vascular system, suggesting adaptations to terrestrial life. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in humid forests. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a critically endangered species."
