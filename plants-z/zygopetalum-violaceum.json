    "intro": "Zygopetalum violaceum, commonly known as the violet orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking violet and purple flowers, which often have a distinctive lip that is wider than the rest of the flower. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, forming pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, arranged in a fan-like pattern around the pseudobulbs. Zygopetalum violaceum thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
