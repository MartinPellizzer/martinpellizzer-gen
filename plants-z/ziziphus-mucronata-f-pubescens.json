    "intro": "Ziziphus mucronata f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy date plum, is a variant of the date plum native to South Africa. It is characterized by its hairy foliage and small, yellowish-green fruits that are typically harvested when fully ripe. The plant thrives in warm, dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its fruit is edible, though it is generally less sweet and more tart compared to the common date plum. The hairy pubescence on its leaves and stems is a distinguishing feature of this particular form."
