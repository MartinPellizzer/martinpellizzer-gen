    "intro": "Zygogynum cyclopensis, commonly known as the cyclopensis cycad, is a unique plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a single, large, fan-shaped leaf that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically green when immature and turn brown as they mature. Native to Madagascar, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
