    "intro": "Zelkova serrata var. longifolia, commonly known as the Japanese zelkova, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically longer and more slender than those of the typical Zelkova serrata. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions."
