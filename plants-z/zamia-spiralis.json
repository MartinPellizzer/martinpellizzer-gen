    "intro": "Zamia spiralis, commonly known as the spiral cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves. The plant features a short, thick trunk with a crown of pinnately compound leaves that are typically blue-green in color. Zamia spiralis produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
