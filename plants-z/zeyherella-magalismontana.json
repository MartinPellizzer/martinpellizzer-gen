    "intro": "Zeyherella magalismontana, commonly known as the Magalismontana zeyherella, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Zeyherella magalismontana is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat."
