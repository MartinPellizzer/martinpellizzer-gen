    "intro": "Zephyranthes mesochloa f. grandiflora, commonly known as the giant rain lily, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in the evening, a trait that aligns with its common name. The plant features strap-like, narrow leaves that are typically evergreen and arranged in a basal rosette. Native to the tropical regions of the Americas, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical significance lies in its ornamental value and its role in ecological systems where it provides nectar for nocturnal pollinators."
