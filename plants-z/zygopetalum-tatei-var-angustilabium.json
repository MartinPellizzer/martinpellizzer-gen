    "intro": "Zygopetalum tatei var. angustilabium, commonly known as the narrow-lipped zygopetalum, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, often with a distinctive lip that is narrower than the other petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
