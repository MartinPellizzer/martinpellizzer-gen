    "intro": "Zamia macrochiera, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its large, stiff, feathery leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones on separate plants, and it is dioecious. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
