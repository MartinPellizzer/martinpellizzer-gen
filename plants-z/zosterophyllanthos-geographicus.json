It belongs to the order Zosterophyllophyta, which includes some of the earliest land plants. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with branching, ribbon-like structures that resemble early vascular plant forms. Its reproductive structures are simple, consisting of sporangia that produce spores for propagation. This species provides valuable insights into the evolutionary transition from aquatic to terrestrial plant life."
