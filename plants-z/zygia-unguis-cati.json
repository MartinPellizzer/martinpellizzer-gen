    "intro": "Zygia unguis-cati, commonly known as the cat's claw, is a climbing plant native to South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, round fruits. Its most distinctive feature is the hooked thorns on its stems, which resemble a cat's claw, giving it its common name. Zygia unguis-cati is often found in humid, tropical environments and is adapted to climbing structures for support."
