    "intro": "Zerna angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf wild rye, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, narrow leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. Zerna angustifolia is valued for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
