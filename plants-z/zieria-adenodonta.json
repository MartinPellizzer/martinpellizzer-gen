    "intro": "Zieria adenodonta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved zieria, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and sandy soils, often in areas with high rainfall. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. Its small, white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters during late spring to early summer. Zieria adenodonta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
