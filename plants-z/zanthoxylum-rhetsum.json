It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its spiny branches and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Zanthoxylum rhetsum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks."
