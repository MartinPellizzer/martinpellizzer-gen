    "intro": "Zygocactus candidus, commonly known as the white zygocactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, thick stems and clusters of white, waxy flowers that bloom in the winter. The plant has a succulent structure, allowing it to store water in its stems and leaves. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss. Zygocactus candidus prefers well-draining soil and indirect sunlight, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
