    "intro": "Zantedeschia odorata, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features striking arrowhead-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in swampy areas. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant's botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in wetland ecosystems."
