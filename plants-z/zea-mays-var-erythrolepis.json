    "intro": "Zea mays var. erythrolepis, commonly known as the red-leaf maize, is a variant of maize characterized by its distinctive red foliage. This variety is native to the Americas and is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for grain production. The leaves of Zea mays var. erythrolepis display vibrant red pigmentation due to the presence of anthocyanin compounds. It thrives in temperate climates and requires full sun exposure for optimal growth. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with a bushy appearance that makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
