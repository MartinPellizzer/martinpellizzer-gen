    "intro": "Zannichellia palustris subsp. polycarpa, commonly known as the marsh pondweed, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, slender, ribbon-like leaves that are usually submerged, with small, green flowers that emerge above the water surface. It is characterized by its ability to produce multiple fruiting structures, which contribute to its common name \"polycarpa.\" This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
