    "intro": "Zerna arctica, commonly known as Arctic zerna, is a hardy plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, rounded seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in harsh environments. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss and protect against freezing temperatures. Zerna arctica plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its habitat, providing food and shelter for various Arctic wildlife species."
