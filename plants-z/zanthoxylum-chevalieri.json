    "intro": "Zanthoxylum chevalieri, commonly known as the Sierra Madre prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 foliages, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The fruit is a red, fleshy drupe that contains several seeds, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
