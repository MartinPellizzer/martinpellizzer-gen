    "intro": "Zoelleria, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, consists of several species native to various regions of the world. These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a disc or showy ray pattern. Zoelleria species typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. They are often found in open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. Due to their ornamental value and ecological importance, some species of Zoelleria are cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
