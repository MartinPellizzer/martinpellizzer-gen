It is characterized by its vibrant, showy blooms that come in a variety of colors, including red, yellow, orange, and white. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of 1 to 3 feet, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are composed of a central disk surrounded by ray florets, which are often mistaken for petals. Zinnia littoralis is well adapted to hot, dry climates and thrives in full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardeners in arid regions."
