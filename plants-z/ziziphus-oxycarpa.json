    "intro": "Ziziphus oxycarpa, commonly known as the sour date tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, yellow to orange fruits that are typically sour but can be sweet when fully ripe. It is well adapted to drought conditions and has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil. Ziziphus oxycarpa is also valued for its ecological role in providing food for wildlife and its potential medicinal uses."
