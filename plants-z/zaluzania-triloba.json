    "intro": "Zaluzania triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed goldenweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a terminal head. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control. Zaluzania triloba is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
