    "intro": "Zamia silvicola, commonly known as the forest zamia, is a cycad-like plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones rather than flowers, which are typically found in clusters at the base of the plant. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it conserve water in its natural habitat. Zamia silvicola is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
