    "intro": "Zornia glauca, commonly known as blue zornia, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a bluish-gray appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, meadows, and along stream banks. Zornia glauca plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
