    "intro": "Zygophyllum pinnatum subsp. pinnatum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
