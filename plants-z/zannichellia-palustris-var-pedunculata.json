It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, opposite leaves that are often ribbon-like in shape. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers on separate plants, and it produces small, greenish fruits that disperse via water. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
