    "intro": "Zieria veronicea, commonly known as the violet myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers in late summer to early autumn, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Zieria veronicea is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden air, thriving in maritime climates."
