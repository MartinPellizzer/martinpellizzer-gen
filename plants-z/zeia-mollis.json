    "intro": "Zeia mollis, commonly known as the soft leaf plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, adding a delicate aesthetic to its appearance. Zeia mollis thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique botanical features make it a desirable plant for both ornamental and ecological purposes in suitable climates."
