    "intro": "Zizania aquatica var. interior, commonly known as inland\u83f0, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that float on the water surface, with dense clusters of spike-like inflorescences rising from the water. Its seeds, known as grains of rice, are encased in a fibrous husk and are often consumed by waterfowl. This species plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife."
