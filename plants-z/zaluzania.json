It consists of several species, most of which are native to North America, particularly the eastern and central United States. These plants typically have tall, sturdy stems and are characterized by their showy, purple or pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. Zaluzania species are often found in moist or wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks."
