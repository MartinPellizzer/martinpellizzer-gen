It has long, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide, adapted for underwater environments. This species forms dense underwater meadows that provide habitat and nursery grounds for various marine organisms. It reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, with seeds and rhizomes contributing to its spread. The plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and improving water quality in coastal ecosystems."
