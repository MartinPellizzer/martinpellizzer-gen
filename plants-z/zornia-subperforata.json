    "intro": "Zornia subperforata, commonly known as the perforate zornia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which have a distinctive perforation in the central lobe, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by narrow, elongated pods that contain several seeds. Native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils in arid environments. Zornia subperforata is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
