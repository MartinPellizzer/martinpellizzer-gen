It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers and succulent leaves adapted to water conservation. The plant thrives in coastal and inland saline soils, showcasing its halophytic nature. Its root system helps stabilize sandy or salt-affected soils, making it ecologically significant in degraded landscapes. Zygophyllum halophilum is also valued for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate salts."
