    "intro": "Zanthoxylum comosum, commonly known as the prickly ash or white snakeroot, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife species. Zanthoxylum comosum is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its historical use by Indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes highlights its cultural and botanical significance."
