    "intro": "Zamia floridana var. purshiana, commonly known as the Florida cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is a gymnosperm, characterized by its stout, woody trunk and a crown of pinnately divided, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
