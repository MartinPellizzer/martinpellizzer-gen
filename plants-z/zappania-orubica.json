    "intro": "Zappania orubica, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often surrounded by spiny bracts. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and protecting it from herbivores. Zappania orubica is well adapted to harsh desert environments, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
