    "intro": "Zamia fairchildiana, commonly known as the Fairchild's cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a slow-growing evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its striking appearance. Zamia fairchildiana is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil and bright, indirect light."
