    "intro": "Zoysia matrella var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese zoysia, is a warm-season grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fine-textured foliage and dark green color, making it a popular choice for lawns and ornamental landscapes. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form a thick, uniform turf. Zoysia matrella var. japonica is also valued for its ability to withstand foot traffic and maintain its appearance with minimal maintenance."
