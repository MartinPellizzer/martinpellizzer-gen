    "intro": "Zornia ovata, commonly known as the ovalleaf zornia, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate in shape. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Zornia ovata is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
