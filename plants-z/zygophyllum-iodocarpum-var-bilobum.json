    "intro": "Zygophyllum iodocarpum var. bilobum, commonly known as the coastal sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The leaves are typically small, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or salt marshes. Its ecological role includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
