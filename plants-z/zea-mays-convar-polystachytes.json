    "intro": "Zea mays convar. polystachytes, commonly known as the wild maize or teosinte, is a grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and branched inflorescence, which consists of multiple spikelets. The plant typically has narrow, blade-like leaves and produces small, spiky flowers that are wind-pollinated. It is considered a wild relative of modern corn and exhibits a variety of genetic traits that are valuable for breeding programs. Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies of plant evolution and domestication."
