    "intro": "Zaluzania asperrima, commonly known as the roughleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy purple to pinkish-red flower heads in the late summer, which are clustered in cylindrical shapes. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Zaluzania asperrima is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
