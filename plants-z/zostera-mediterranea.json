This plant forms dense underwater meadows in shallow coastal waters, often in areas with sandy or muddy substrates. Zostera mediterranea plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. It is also an important component of coastal ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and carbon sequestration."
