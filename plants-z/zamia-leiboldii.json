    "intro": "Zamia leiboldii, commonly known as the Leibold's cycad, is a species of cycad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
