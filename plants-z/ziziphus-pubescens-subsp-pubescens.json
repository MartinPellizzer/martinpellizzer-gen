    "intro": "Ziziphus pubescens subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent ziziphus, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, edible berries that are typically red or orange when mature. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough, hairy texture. This species is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
