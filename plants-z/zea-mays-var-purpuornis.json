    "intro": "Zea mays var. purpuornis, commonly known as the purple corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its striking purple pigmentation in the kernels. This coloration is primarily due to the presence of anthocyanins, which are flavonoid compounds responsible for the vibrant hues in many plants. The plant is native to Mexico and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for use in traditional foods and beverages. It typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 2 meters, with tall, sturdy stalks and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in tassels at the top of the plant, which are pollinated by wind."
