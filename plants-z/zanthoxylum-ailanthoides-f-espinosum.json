    "intro": "Zanthoxylum ailanthoides f. espinosum, commonly known as the spiny winged sumac, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of leaflets, and its distinctive, winged fruits that are clustered in panicles. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by the development of its characteristic red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and woodland edges. The spiny fruits and foliage make it a notable species for both its ecological role and ornamental value."
