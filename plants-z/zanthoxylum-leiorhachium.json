    "intro": "Zanthoxylum leiorhachium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Zanthoxylum leiorhachium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
