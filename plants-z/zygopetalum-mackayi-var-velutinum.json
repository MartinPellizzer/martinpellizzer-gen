It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in a range of colors from deep red to purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests or mountainous regions. Its flowers are zygomorphic, meaning they are bilaterally symmetrical, a feature common in many orchid species. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
