    "intro": "Zosterophyllanthos index, commonly known as the coastal zosterophyll, is a marine plant belonging to the order Zosterophyllales. It is characterized by its ribbon-like, branching structure that resembles a flat, ribbon-shaped thallus. This plant thrives in shallow, coastal waters where it attaches to rocky substrates. Its botanical features include a lack of true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead consists of a network of filamentous structures. Zosterophyllanthos index plays a role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms."
