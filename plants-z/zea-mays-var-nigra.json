    "intro": "Zea mays var. nigra, commonly known as black corn or negra corn, is a variety of maize characterized by its dark purple to black kernels. This plant belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to the Americas, particularly Mexico. The dark coloration of its kernels is due to high levels of anthocyanins, which also contribute to its nutritional value. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and used in traditional cuisines and crafts. The plant typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 2 meters and produces tassels and ears similar to other maize varieties."
