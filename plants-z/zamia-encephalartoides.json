    "intro": "Zamia encephalartoides, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a cycad, characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
