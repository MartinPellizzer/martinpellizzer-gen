    "intro": "Zieria granulata var. adenodonta, commonly known as the granular zieria, is a rare and delicate shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the family Epacridaceae and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in heathlands and rocky soils, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful management to ensure its survival."
