    "intro": "Zigadenus mohinorensis, commonly known as Mohinorensis deathcamas, is a toxic plant native to the high Andes of Bolivia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, particularly cyclotides, which can be lethal if ingested. It typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments and is adapted to cool, moist conditions. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided by both animals and humans."
