    "intro": "Zamia bussellii, commonly known as the Bussell's cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is a slow-growing, dioecious plant with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its botanical features include a thick, fibrous root system and a unique ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. Zamia bussellii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in traditional medicine."
