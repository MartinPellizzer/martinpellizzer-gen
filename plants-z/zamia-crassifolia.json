    "intro": "Zamia crassifolia, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is characterized by its large, fern-like leaves and a stout, unbranched trunk. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
