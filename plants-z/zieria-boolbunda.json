    "intro": "Zieria boolbunda, commonly known as the narrow-leaf zieria, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Its foliage is dense and provides habitat for various invertebrates, making it ecologically significant in its native environment. Zieria boolbunda is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure."
