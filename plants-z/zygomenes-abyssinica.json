It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Zygomenes abyssinica is adapted to thrive in arid and rocky environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
