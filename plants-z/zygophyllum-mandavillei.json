    "intro": "Zygophyllum mandavillei, commonly known as the Mandaville desert bean, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae, characterized by its small, often spiny leaves and showy, yellow or orange flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hard-coated seeds that are dispersed by wind. Zygophyllum mandavillei plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert fauna."
