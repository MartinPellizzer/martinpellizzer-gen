    "intro": "Zigadenus salinus, commonly known as the saltbush deathcarp, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its yellow flowers and toxic alkaloids. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or saline soils. It has small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its toxicity, it is important to avoid contact with any part of the plant."
