    "intro": "Zygophyllum kopalense, commonly known as the desert raisin, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and fleshy, spiny leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert environments where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes. Its fruit, which resembles a raisin, is edible and has been used traditionally by local communities for food and medicine. Zygophyllum kopalense is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
