    "intro": "Zalaccella, commonly known as the purple mangosteen, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are dark green and glossy, and its striking purple or reddish flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are encased in a thick, segmented rind. The fruit's interior contains segmented segments filled with white, juicy flesh that is often consumed fresh or processed into products. Zalaccella thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its edible fruit."
