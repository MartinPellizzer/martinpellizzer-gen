    "intro": "Zerna myuros, commonly known as the water zerna, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a reddish hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Zerna myuros is valued for its ability to thrive in moist soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
