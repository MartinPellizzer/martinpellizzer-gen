    "intro": "Zosterella longituba, commonly known as the long-stemmed zosterella, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Zingiberaceae, which includes ginger and turmeric. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. Zosterella longituba is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value and has limited use in traditional medicine."
