    "intro": "Zanthoxylum articulatum, commonly known as the prickly ash or Indian turnsole, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with medicinal properties, traditionally used by Native American tribes for their therapeutic effects. Zanthoxylum articulatum is also notable for its distinctive, branched structure and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
