    "intro": "Zanthoxylum claessensii, commonly known as the African prickly ash, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. Zanthoxylum claessensii is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its thorny stems and aromatic leaves make it a distinctive and resilient plant in its native habitat."
