    "intro": "Zygophyllum semiteres, commonly known as the narrowleaf desert raisin, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its small, fleshy, spine-tipped leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its thick, succulent leaves help store moisture, while its deep root system allows it to access groundwater. Zygophyllum semiteres plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small animals and insects."
