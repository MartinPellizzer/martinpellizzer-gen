    "intro": "Zexmenia helianthoides var. genuina, commonly known as the narrowleaf zexmenia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
