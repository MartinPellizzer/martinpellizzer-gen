It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its spiny stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Zanthoxylum luizii is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
