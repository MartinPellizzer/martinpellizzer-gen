    "intro": "Zeuxine parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved zeuxine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Zeuxine parvifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
