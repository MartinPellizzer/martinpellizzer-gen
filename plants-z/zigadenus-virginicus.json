    "intro": "Zigadenus virginicus, commonly known as the eastern death camas, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces toxic alkaloids, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Due to its toxicity and resemblance to non-toxic plants, it is often mistaken for edible species, posing a significant risk if ingested."
