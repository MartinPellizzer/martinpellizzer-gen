    "intro": "Zamia furfuracea, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a species of cycad native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Zamia furfuracea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
