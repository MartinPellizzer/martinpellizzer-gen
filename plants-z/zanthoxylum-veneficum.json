    "intro": "Zanthoxylum veneficum, commonly known as poisonwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for its toxic properties, as its roots, stems, and leaves contain various alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals. Zanthoxylum veneficum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Despite its toxicity, it plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for certain insects and birds."
