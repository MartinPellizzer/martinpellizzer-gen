    "intro": "Zehneria pisifera, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a complex root system that helps anchor it in water and absorb nutrients. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, rounded lobes that aid in photosynthesis. Zehneria pisifera is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes."
