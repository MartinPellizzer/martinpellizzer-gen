    "intro": "Zamia caffra, commonly known as the African cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to South Africa. It is a perennial plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Zamia caffra is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and slow growth rate."
