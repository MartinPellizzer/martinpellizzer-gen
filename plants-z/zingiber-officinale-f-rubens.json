    "intro": "Zingiber officinale f. rubens, commonly known as red ginger, is a cultivar of the ginger plant characterized by its striking red or orange-pink flower bracts. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-draining soil. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green, contrasting beautifully with its vibrant floral display. While the rhizomes are edible and similar to common ginger, the plant is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value. It is often used in gardens and as a decorative plant due to its eye-catching appearance."
