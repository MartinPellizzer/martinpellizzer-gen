    "intro": "Zieria littoralis, commonly known as the coastal zieria, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand coastal exposure make it a resilient species in harsh environments. Zieria littoralis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
