    "intro": "Zea mays subsp. indentata, commonly known as the Mexican corn or teosinte, is a wild relative of maize with distinctive botanical features. It is a grass species native to Mexico and has narrow, linear leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in hard, spiky husks, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. This subspecies is significant in agricultural research due to its genetic diversity and role in the domestication of modern corn."
