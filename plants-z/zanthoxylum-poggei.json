    "intro": "Zanthoxylum poggei, commonly known as the Pogge's prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant autumn foliage and distinctive, spiny stems. Zanthoxylum poggei is often found in moist, wooded areas and is adapted to partial to full sunlight."
