    "intro": "Zieria buxijugum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved zieria, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the family Epacridaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne in clusters along the stems. Zieria buxijugum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and sand dunes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, low-growing thickets."
