    "intro": "Zerna vogulica, commonly known as the Vogulian millet, is a grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered spikelets that produce tiny grains. The plant thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its seeds are primarily used for food, though it also plays a role in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution, Zerna vogulica is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
