    "intro": "Zostera nana var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf dwarf seagrass, is a variant of the seagrass species Zostera nana. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are broader than those of the typical Zostera nana. This plant typically grows in shallow coastal waters, often in sandy or muddy substrates. It plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence is an indicator of healthy, undisturbed coastal environments."
