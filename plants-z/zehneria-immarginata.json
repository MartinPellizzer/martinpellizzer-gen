It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Zehneria immarginata is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
