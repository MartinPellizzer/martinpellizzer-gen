    "intro": "Zannichellia dentata subsp. macrostemon, commonly known as the broad-stemmed water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with some floating leaves at the water's surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces distinctive, elongated seed pods. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic life and its aesthetic appeal in water gardens."
