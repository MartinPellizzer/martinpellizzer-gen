    "intro": "Zannichellia palustris var. aculeata, commonly known as the spiked water violet, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant is characterized by its small, violet-colored flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are submerged, while the flowering stems rise to the surface. This variety is distinguished by the presence of small spines on its leaves, which give it its common name."
