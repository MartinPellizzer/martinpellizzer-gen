It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its bark and leaves contain various bioactive compounds, making it of interest in traditional medicine. Zanthoxylum anadenium thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests and savannas, and is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns."
