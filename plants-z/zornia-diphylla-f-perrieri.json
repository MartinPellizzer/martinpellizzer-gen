    "intro": "Zornia diphylla f. perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's two-leaved zornia, is a flowering plant species belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in clusters, and its leaves are usually simple and alternate. The plant is native to certain regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile, where it thrives in dry, arid environments. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial, depending on the climate, and often grows in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its family."
