    "intro": "Zamia ipetiensis, commonly known as the Yucat\u00e1n cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, woody stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in limestone soils and humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zamia ipetiensis is considered a vulnerable species."
