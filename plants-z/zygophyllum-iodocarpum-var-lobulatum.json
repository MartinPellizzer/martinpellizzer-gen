    "intro": "Zygophyllum iodocarpum var. lobulatum, commonly known as the coastal sandmat, is a low-growing, perennial herb native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often lobed, which help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy soils and access deep water sources. This variety is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of desert and coastal ecosystems."
