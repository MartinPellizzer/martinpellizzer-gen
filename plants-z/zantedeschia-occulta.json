    "intro": "Zantedeschia occulta, commonly known as the hidden arum, is a rare and elusive member of the Araceae family. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and a single, delicate white flower with a prominent spadix. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. Its limited distribution and rarity make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its endangered status, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
