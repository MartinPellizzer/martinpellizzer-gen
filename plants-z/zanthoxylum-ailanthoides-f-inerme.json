    "intro": "Zanthoxylum ailanthoides f. inerme, commonly known as the smooth fringed prickly ash, is a shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and light gray, and it has a distinctive, aromatic scent when crushed. The species is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and streambanks."
