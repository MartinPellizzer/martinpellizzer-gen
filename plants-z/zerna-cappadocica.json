    "intro": "Zerna cappadocica, commonly known as Cappadocian millet, is a small-seeded grass native to the Cappadocia region of Turkey. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and drought-resistant properties. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by the development of hard, angular grains. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, making it well-suited for cultivation in regions with limited water resources. Due to its resilience, it has been used traditionally as a food source and forage crop in the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern areas."
