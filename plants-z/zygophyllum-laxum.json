    "intro": "Zygophyllum laxum, commonly known as the desert gypsum plant, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in saline and gypsum soils, showcasing its adaptation to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small and succulent, reducing water loss through transpiration. Zygophyllum laxum plays a vital role in stabilizing desert soils and supporting local biodiversity."
