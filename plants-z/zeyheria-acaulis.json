The plant has small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are gray-green, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Zeyheria acaulis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to arid environments. It is often used in rock gardens and is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
