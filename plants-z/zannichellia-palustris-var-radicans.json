    "intro": "Zannichellia palustris var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping waterwort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has slender, branching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread horizontally along the substrate. Its small, oval leaves are usually arranged in whorls and are submerged, while some may emerge above the water surface. It produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
