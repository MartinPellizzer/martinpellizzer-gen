    "intro": "Zamaria, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its flowers bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Zamaria is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
