    "intro": "Zygophyllum decumbens var. megacarpum, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low, spreading growth habit and small, leathery leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hardy nature makes it well adapted to poor soils and extreme temperatures. The large, woody fruits of this variety are important food sources for various desert animals."
