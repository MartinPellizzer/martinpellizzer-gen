    "intro": "Zygophyllum propinquum subsp. migahidii, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers, typically in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and plains habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it plays an important role in desert ecosystems."
