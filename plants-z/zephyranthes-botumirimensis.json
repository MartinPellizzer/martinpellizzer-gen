    "intro": "Zephyranthes botumirimensis, commonly known as the Bahamian rain lily, is a herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Bahamas. It is characterized by its striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, often appearing after thunderstorms. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are typically evergreen, and it grows in well-drained soils in open, sunny habitats. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family, which includes many ornamental and ornamental bulbous plants. Due to its unique flowering behavior and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
