    "intro": "Zanthoxylum burkillianum, commonly known as Burkill's prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a spicy, peppery flavor due to the presence of alkaloids. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Zanthoxylum burkillianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
