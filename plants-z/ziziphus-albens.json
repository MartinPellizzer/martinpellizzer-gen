    "intro": "Ziziphus albens, commonly known as the white ziziphus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and is characterized by its slender, often thorny branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that turn red when mature. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy appearance with a serrated margin. Ziziphus albens is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas."
