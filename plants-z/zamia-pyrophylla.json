    "intro": "Zamia pyrophylla, commonly known as the torch pine or flame plant, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a cycad-like plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
