    "intro": "Zygia saman, commonly known as the ceiba tree, is a large tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and a broad, umbrella-like canopy. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody pods containing seeds. Its bark is thick and fibrous, and it is often used in traditional medicine. The ceiba tree plays a significant ecological role in tropical rainforests, providing habitat and food for various species."
