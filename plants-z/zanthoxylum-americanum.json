It is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its bark and berries have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties. Zanthoxylum americanum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
