    "intro": "Zelkoua, commonly known as the mountain mallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. The plants are characterized by their palmate leaves, which are often lobed and have a velvety texture. They produce showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, typically blooming in summer. Zelkoua species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens for their striking foliage and blooms."
