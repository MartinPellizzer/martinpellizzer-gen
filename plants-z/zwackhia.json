    "intro": "Zwackhia, commonly known as the \"cabbage tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae, which includes grasses. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plants typically grow in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Zwackhia species are often used in ornamental horticulture for their attractive, feathery appearance. They are also valued for their ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland areas."
