    "intro": "Zanthoxylum acanthopodium var. oligotrichum, commonly known as the Chinese prickly ash, is a shrub native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red or orange berries that are edible but often have a spicy, citrusy flavor due to the presence of alkaloids. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value and medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest in both horticulture and traditional medicine."
