    "intro": "Zamia elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic cycad, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, Zamia elliptica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens."
