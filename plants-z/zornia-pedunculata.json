    "intro": "Zornia pedunculata, commonly known as the slender zornia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Zornia pedunculata is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
