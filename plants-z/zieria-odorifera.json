    "intro": "Zieria odorifera, commonly known as the sweet-scented zieria, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Epacridaceae and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in heathlands and moist, acidic soils, often in coastal regions. Its fragrance is attributed to the presence of essential oils in its foliage. Zieria odorifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
