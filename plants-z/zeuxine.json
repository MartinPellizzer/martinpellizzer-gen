    "intro": "Zeuxine, commonly known as the false daffodil, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often yellow or orange flowers that resemble those of daffodils. Zeuxine species typically grow in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors or wet meadows. They have basal leaves that are usually heart-shaped or spatulate, and their stems are usually unbranched. The flowers are composed of two whorls of petals and are often followed by small, capsule-like fruits."
