    "intro": "Zamia concinna, commonly known as the smooth cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a dioecious plant, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate individuals. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male cones bearing pollen sacs and female cones containing ovules. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive waxy texture and a dark green color. Zamia concinna is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments."
