    "intro": "Zanthoxylum texanum, commonly known as Texas prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southern United States. It features compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its distinctive, spiny branches and aromatic foliage make it a notable species in its native habitat."
