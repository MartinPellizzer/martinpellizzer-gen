    "intro": "Zinnia flavicoma, commonly known as the yellow-flowered zinnia, is a species native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its vibrant yellow to orange flowers and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with branching stems that produce numerous flower heads. Its flowers are composite, consisting of a central disc surrounded by ray florets, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. Zinnia flavicoma is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower due to its bright color and long-lasting blooms."
