It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, clustered inflorescences bearing tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
