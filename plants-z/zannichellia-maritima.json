It is characterized by its submerged or floating leaves and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. This aquatic plant is typically found in brackish or freshwater environments, such as marshes and wetlands. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for aquatic life. Zannichellia maritima plays a role in stabilizing sediments and supporting biodiversity in coastal and freshwater ecosystems."
