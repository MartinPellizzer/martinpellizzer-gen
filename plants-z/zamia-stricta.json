    "intro": "Zamia stricta, commonly known as the straight zamia, is a cycad species native to the southeastern United States. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stiff, unbranched trunk and compound, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and historical significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
