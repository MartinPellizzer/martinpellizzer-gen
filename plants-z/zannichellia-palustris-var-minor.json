    "intro": "Zannichellia palustris var. minor, commonly known as the lesser marsh pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving waters, such as ponds, lakes, and marshes, where it forms dense underwater vegetation. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of mucus. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it relies on water currents for pollination. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
