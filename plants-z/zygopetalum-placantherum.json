    "intro": "Zygopetalum placantherum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, spurred flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Its botanical features include a pseudobulb structure and long, strap-like leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zygopetalum placantherum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
