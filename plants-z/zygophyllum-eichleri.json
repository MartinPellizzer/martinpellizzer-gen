    "intro": "Zygophyllum eichleri, commonly known as the Eichler's prickly scale, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its spiny stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions. Zygophyllum eichleri plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
