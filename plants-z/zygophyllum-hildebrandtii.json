    "intro": "Zygophyllum hildebrandtii, commonly known as the desert mistflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow or white flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Zygophyllum hildebrandtii is well adapted to extreme temperatures and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
