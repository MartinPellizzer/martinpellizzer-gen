It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other economically important plants like ginger and turmeric. The plant produces fragrant, orange-red flowers that bloom in terminal clusters, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture and a distinct, spicy aroma. Zingiber diwakarianum is primarily cultivated for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
