    "intro": "Zappania aristata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Zappania aristata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
