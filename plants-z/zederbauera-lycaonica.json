    "intro": "Zederbauera lycaonica, commonly known as the Lycaonia cedar, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the Taurus Mountains in Turkey. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, dark green foliage, which gives it a striking appearance. The plant has a unique ability to thrive in rocky, arid environments, making it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties, and it has been used historically in construction and traditional crafts. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Zederbauera lycaonica is now classified as critically endangered."
