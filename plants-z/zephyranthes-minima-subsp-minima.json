    "intro": "Zephyranthes minima subsp. minima, commonly known as the dwarf rain lily, is a small, bulbous plant native to the southeastern United States. It produces delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, typically in late spring or early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to wet, boggy environments. It is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its small size and ephemeral flowering, it is a challenging but rewarding species for botanical enthusiasts."
