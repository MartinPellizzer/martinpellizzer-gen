    "intro": "Zornia setosa subsp. setosa, commonly known as the hairy zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with slender, hairy stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Zornia setosa subsp. setosa is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats such as fields and roadsides."
