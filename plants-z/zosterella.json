These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline environments. They have distinctive blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. The leaves are often narrow and covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting hairs. Zosterella species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
