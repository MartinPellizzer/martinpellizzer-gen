    "intro": "Zanthoxylum pentanome, commonly known as the prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 10 inches long and composed of 5 to 11 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Zanthoxylum pentanome thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
