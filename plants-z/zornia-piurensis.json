    "intro": "Zornia piurensis, commonly known as the Peruvian zornia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and can remain viable for extended periods, contributing to its ecological resilience. Zornia piurensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing forage for livestock and supporting pollinator populations."
