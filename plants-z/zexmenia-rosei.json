    "intro": "Zexmenia rosei, commonly known as the pink zexmenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Zingiberaceae, which includes gingers, and is characterized by its ornamental, fragrant flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and produces clusters of pale pink to rose-colored blooms. Zexmenia rosei thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
