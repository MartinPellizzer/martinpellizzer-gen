    "intro": "Zanthoxylum austrosinense var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy Chinese prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnately arranged, with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. The hairy pubescence on its stems and leaves gives it its botanical variant name, var. pubescens."
