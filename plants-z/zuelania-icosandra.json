    "intro": "Zuelania icosandra, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of tropical America, particularly in the Caribbean and northern South America. The plant is characterized by its distinctive red, pencil-like pneumatophores that help it extract oxygen from the waterlogged soil. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Zuelania icosandra plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
