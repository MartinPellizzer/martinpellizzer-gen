    "intro": "Zerna pumpelliana subsp. karavajevii, commonly known as the Karavajev's zerna, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered umbels of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
