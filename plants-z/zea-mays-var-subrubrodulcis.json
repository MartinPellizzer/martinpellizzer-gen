    "intro": "Zea mays var. subrubrodulcis, commonly known as the red corn or sweet red corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its distinctive reddish tassels and husks. This variety is primarily cultivated for its sweet, tender kernels, which are rich in nutrients such as carbohydrates, fiber, and various vitamins. The plant typically grows as an annual grass, reaching heights of up to 2 to 3 meters, with a robust root system that aids in nutrient absorption. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and the ears develop at the top of the stalk, containing rows of kernels that mature in a range of colors, including red, yellow, and white. This botanical variety is valued both for its culinary uses and its role in agricultural biodiversity."
