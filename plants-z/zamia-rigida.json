    "intro": "Zamia rigida, commonly known as the stiff cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico and Central America. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones instead of flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to withstand dry conditions. Zamia rigida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
