It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, and thrives in coastal and lowland habitats. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its fruits are small, woody capsules containing seeds.
