    "intro": "Zingiber mawangense, commonly known as the Mawang ginger, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Zingiberaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Myanmar and Thailand. The plant produces striking, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. Its flowering stems bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers, which are often used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zingiber mawangense is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
