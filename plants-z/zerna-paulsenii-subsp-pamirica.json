    "intro": "Zerna paulsenii subsp. pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir zerna, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of the Pamir Mountains. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle touch of color to its rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat degradation."
