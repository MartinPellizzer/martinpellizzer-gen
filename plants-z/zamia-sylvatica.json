    "intro": "Zamia sylvatica, commonly known as the slender cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Central America. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones rather than flowers. The plant has a short, stout trunk with a crown of large, feathery leaves that are often described as resembling palm fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth rate, it is a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
