    "intro": "Zygia latifolia var. controversa, commonly known as the broad-leaf zygia, is a species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters during the spring. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
