    "intro": "Zanthoxylum bissei, commonly known as the Mexican prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but generally considered unpalatable to humans. Zanthoxylum bissei is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
