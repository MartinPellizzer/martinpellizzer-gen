    "intro": "Zeuxine pantlingii, commonly known as the Kashmir Himalayan zeuxine, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with five sepals and numerous stamens. Zeuxine pantlingii is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations to high-altitude environments."
