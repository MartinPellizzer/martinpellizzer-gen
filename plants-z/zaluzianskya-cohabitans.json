    "intro": "Zaluzianskya cohabitans, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal areas. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Zaluzianskya cohabitans is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
