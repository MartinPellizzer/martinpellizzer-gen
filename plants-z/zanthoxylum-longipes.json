    "intro": "Zanthoxylum longipes, commonly known as the long-fruited prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 4 to 8 inches long and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife species. Zanthoxylum longipes is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland edges. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
