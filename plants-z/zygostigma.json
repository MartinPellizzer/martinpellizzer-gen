    "intro": "Zygostigma, commonly known as the white mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain toxic seeds. Zygostigma is native to regions in Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it plays a role in local ecosystems despite its parasitic nature."
