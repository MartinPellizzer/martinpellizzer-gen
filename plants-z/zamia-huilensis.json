    "intro": "Zamia huilensis, commonly known as the Huil\u00e9 Zamia, is a cycad species native to the humid lowland forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a rosette of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Zamia huilensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
