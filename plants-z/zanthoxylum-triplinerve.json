    "intro": "Zanthoxylum triplinerve, commonly known as the three-veined prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three main veins, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its branches are often covered in small, stiff spines, which serve as a defense mechanism. Zanthoxylum triplinerve is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
