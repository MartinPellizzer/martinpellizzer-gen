    "intro": "Zenia, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, often pink or red, flowers that bloom in clusters. Zenia species are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. They have a widespread distribution across Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. Due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value, some species are cultivated as ornamental plants in dry climates."
