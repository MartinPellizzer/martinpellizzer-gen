    "intro": "Zea mays var. hepaticornis, commonly known as the liver corn or hepaticornis maize, is a variant of corn characterized by its unique leaf and ear structures. This plant is native to the Americas and is cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking, lobed leaves that resemble liver lobes.

Its botanical features make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and educational displays."
