    "intro": "Zyzyxia, commonly known as the moonflower or nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, white or pale flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Zyzyxia species typically have tubular or bell-shaped flowers and are often found in moist, shady environments. They produce small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds, and some species are cultivated for their ornamental value. The genus includes several species, such as Zyzyxia silvestris and Zyzyxia montana, which are native to North America."
