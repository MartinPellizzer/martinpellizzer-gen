    "intro": "Zosima gilliana, commonly known as the silverleaf zosima, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, often with a faint aromatic scent. Zosima gilliana is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats."
