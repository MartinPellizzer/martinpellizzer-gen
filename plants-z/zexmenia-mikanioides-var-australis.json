It is a perennial, herbaceous plant characterized by its climbing habit and intricate, fern-like foliage. The plant features slender, wiry stems that twine around supports, and its leaves are pinnately divided into numerous narrow, lance-shaped segments. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understoreys or along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spore-bearing structures, typical of its fern-like morphology."
