It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its root system is fibrous and can develop into a dense network, aiding in soil stabilization. Zanonia indica var. angustifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks."
