    "intro": "Zamia loddigesii var. cycadifolia, commonly known as the cycad-like zamia, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and exhibits characteristics reminiscent of cycads. It is a cycadophyte, possessing a stout, unbranched stem and pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
