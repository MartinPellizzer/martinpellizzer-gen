It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible but have a sharp, spicy flavor due to the presence of alkaloids. Its bark and leaves contain compounds used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and analgesic properties. Zanthoxylum yakumontanum is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
