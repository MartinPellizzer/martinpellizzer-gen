    "intro": "Zingiber vanlithianum, commonly known as the Vanlithian ginger, is a rare tropical plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other well-known gingers such as turmeric and cardamom. The plant features tall, narrow leaves and produces striking orange-red flowers with a distinctive fragrance. Its rhizomes, similar to those of other gingers, are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
