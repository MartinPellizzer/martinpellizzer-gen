    "intro": "Zoysia sedoides, commonly known as the coastal zoysia, is a grass species native to coastal areas of China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense growth habit, making it well-suited for sandy or coastal soils. The plant is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind, which allows it to thrive in challenging coastal environments. It has a rhizomatous growth system, enabling it to spread and form thick, durable turf. Zoysia sedoides is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ecological resilience."
