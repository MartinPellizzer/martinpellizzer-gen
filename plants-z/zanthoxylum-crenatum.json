    "intro": "Zanthoxylum crenatum, commonly known as the prickly ash or Texas prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Zanthoxylum crenatum is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Its thorny stems and aromatic foliage make it a distinctive and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
