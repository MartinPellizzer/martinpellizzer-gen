    "intro": "Zygopetalum mandibulare, commonly known as the mandibular orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers with a unique, lip-shaped petal that resembles a jaw, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often in shades of pink, red, or orange, and are known for their intricate, three-dimensional structure. Zygopetalum mandibulare is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
