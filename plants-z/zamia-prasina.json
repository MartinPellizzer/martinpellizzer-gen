    "intro": "Zamia prasina, commonly known as the slender cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones rather than flowers. The plant has a short trunk with a crown of pinnate leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus. Zamia prasina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is considered a slow-growing plant with a long lifespan."
