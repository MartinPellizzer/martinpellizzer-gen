    "intro": "Zanthoxylum stenopterum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Zanthoxylum stenopterum is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in partial to full sun, making it a versatile plant in woodland and garden settings. Its prickly stems and aromatic foliage make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species."
