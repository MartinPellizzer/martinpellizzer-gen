    "intro": "Zamia lindosensis, commonly known as the Lindos Zamia, is a cycad-like plant native to the island of Cyprus. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and compound leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species."
