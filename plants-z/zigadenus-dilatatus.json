    "intro": "Zigadenus dilatatus, commonly known as the death camas, is a toxic plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Melanthiaceae family and typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. The plant features grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its bulbs contain toxic alkaloids, making it highly dangerous to both humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often mistaken for edible plants like true camas, leading to accidental poisoning."
