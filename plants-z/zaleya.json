    "intro": "Zaleya, commonly known as the goldenweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to the Americas and are characterized by their showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Zaleya species typically grow in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. They have alternate, linear leaves and produce small, bract-like structures around their flower heads. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine."
