It belongs to the family Zingiberaceae, which includes ginger and turmeric, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces striking, brightly colored inflorescences that are often adorned with intricate, spurred petals.

Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and botanists."
