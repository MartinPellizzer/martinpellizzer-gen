    "intro": "Zichya angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ziziphus, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed. Zichya angustifolia is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
