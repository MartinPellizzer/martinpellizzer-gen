    "intro": "Zannichellia dentata subsp. pedicellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Zannichellia dentata subsp. pedicellata is often found in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds, lakes, and ditches."
