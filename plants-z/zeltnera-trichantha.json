    "intro": "Zeltnera trichantha, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water. Zeltnera trichantha is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
