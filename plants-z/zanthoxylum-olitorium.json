    "intro": "Zanthoxylum olitorium, commonly known as the prickly ash or yellow sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually 3 to 5 inches long and consist of 13 to 31 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, fuzzy berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent and stimulant properties. Zanthoxylum olitorium thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas."
