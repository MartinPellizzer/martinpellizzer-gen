    "intro": "Zamia multifoliolata, commonly known as the Florida cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are typically bright green and can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. Zamia multifoliolata is adapted to well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats."
