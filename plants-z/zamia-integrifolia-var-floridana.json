    "intro": "Zamia integrifolia var. floridana, commonly known as the Florida cycad, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
