    "intro": "Zygophyllum stapffii, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a shrub or perennial herb with small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Zygophyllum stapffii is adapted to extreme temperatures and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
