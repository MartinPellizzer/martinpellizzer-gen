    "intro": "Zabelia triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered zabelia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that typically display vibrant colors such as red, orange, or yellow. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. Zabelia triflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats. It is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine in some African communities."
