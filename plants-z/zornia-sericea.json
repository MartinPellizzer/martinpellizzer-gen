    "intro": "Zornia sericea, commonly known as silky zornia, is a low-growing annual herb native to North America. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, branching stems covered in fine, silky hairs. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a bluish-gray appearance due to their dense pubescence. Its small, pink to purple flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, three-lobed pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
