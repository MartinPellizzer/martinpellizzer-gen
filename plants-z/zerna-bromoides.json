It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and wastelands. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, pale green to brownish flowers. Zerna bromoides is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
