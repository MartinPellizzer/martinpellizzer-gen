    "intro": "Zehneria ejecta, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with long, thin, white roots that resemble spectral tendrils. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, which are covered in a dense layer of spongy, white tissue. It produces small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding to its ethereal beauty. Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, Zehneria ejecta is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
