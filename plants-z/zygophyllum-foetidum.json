    "intro": "Zygophyllum foetidum, commonly known as the stinking false nettle, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a distinctive, unpleasant odor, which is thought to deter herbivores. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep roots and succulent tissues. Zygophyllum foetidum plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for certain insects and birds."
