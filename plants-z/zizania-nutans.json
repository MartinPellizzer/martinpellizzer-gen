It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often grow in shallow water or wetlands. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that droop downward, giving it its common name. Its rhizomes are edible and have been used by indigenous peoples for food and medicine. Zizania nutans plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
