    "intro": "Zigadenus elegans subsp. glaucus, commonly known as the blue-flowered death camas, is a member of the Melanthiaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to western North America, particularly found in California and Oregon. The plant features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters at the top of slender stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a poisonous plant and should be handled with care."
