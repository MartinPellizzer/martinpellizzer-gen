    "intro": "Zamia paucijuga, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a dioecious plant, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate plants. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Its cones, which are the reproductive structures, are either male or female and are produced on separate plants. Zamia paucijuga is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
