    "intro": "Zygopetalum mackayi, commonly known as the Mackay's zygopetalum, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically display a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its challenging mountainous habitat. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapting to the cool, humid conditions of its native environment. Zygopetalum mackayi is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and limited natural distribution."
