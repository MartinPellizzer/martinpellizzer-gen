    "intro": "Zea mays var. leucopais, commonly known as the white corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its distinctive white kernels. This variety is native to the Americas and is cultivated for both its nutritional value and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 meters, with long, narrow leaves and a tassel-like inflorescence at the top. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses, and the ears of corn develop from the female inflorescence. The botanical features of Zea mays var. leucopais make it an important crop in traditional and modern agriculture."
