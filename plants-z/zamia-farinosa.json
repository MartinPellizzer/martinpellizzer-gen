    "intro": "Zamia farinosa, commonly known as the breadfruit plant, is a cycad species native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, edible aril. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance in traditional diets, Zamia farinosa is often cultivated in gardens and conservation programs."
