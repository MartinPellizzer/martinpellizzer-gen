    "intro": "Zygophlebia dudleyi, commonly known as the Dudley's zygophlebia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous forests. Its leaves are elliptical and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Zygophlebia dudleyi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
