    "intro": "Zanthoxylum sorbifolium, commonly known as the Chinese prickly ash, is a shrub native to the arid regions of China, Mongolia, and Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Zanthoxylum sorbifolium is adapted to harsh, dry environments and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils. It is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
