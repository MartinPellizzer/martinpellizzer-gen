    "intro": "Zanthoxylum piperitum f. brevispinum, commonly known as the short-spined prickly ash, is a variant of the Chinese prickly ash. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its thorny stems and compact growth habit make it well adapted to rocky or dry soils. This form is notable for its reduced spines compared to the typical species, making it more ornamental in cultivation."
