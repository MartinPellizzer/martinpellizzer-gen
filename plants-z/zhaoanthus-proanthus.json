    "intro": "Zhaoanthus proanthus, commonly known as the Pacific silver fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, columnar form and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of conifers. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Zhaoanthus proanthus plays an important ecological role in its native forests, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
