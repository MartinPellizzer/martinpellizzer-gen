    "intro": "Zeuxine roxburghii, commonly known as the Himalayan zigzag root, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging stems and delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the base of the plant. Zeuxine roxburghii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense ground covers in suitable environments."
