    "intro": "Zantedeschia, commonly known as the calla lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the arum family, Araceae. It is characterized by its striking, spatulate-shaped leaves and its distinctive, funnel-like white or brightly colored spathe that surrounds the small, yellowish spadix. Native to southern Africa, Zantedeschia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and as cut flowers. The plants typically grow from corms and thrive in moist, well-drained soil. They are popular for their elegant appearance and are often used in floral arrangements."
