    "intro": "Zigadenus hintoniorum, commonly known as Hinton's death camice, is a strikingly poisonous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Melanthiaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, including cyclopentane derivatives, which can be lethal if ingested. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, often in areas with well-drained soil. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid consumption."
