    "intro": "Zanthoxylum taediosum subsp. shaferi, commonly known as the Shafer's prickly ash, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 4 to 8 inches long and composed of 5 to 9 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant's thorny stems and aromatic foliage make it a distinctive member of the Rutaceae family."
