    "intro": "Zanthoxylum rhoifolium, commonly known as the prickly ash or Indian prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually composed of 5 to 9 pairs of opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Its bark and leaves contain various bioactive compounds, making it valuable in traditional medicine. Zanthoxylum rhoifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream valleys."
