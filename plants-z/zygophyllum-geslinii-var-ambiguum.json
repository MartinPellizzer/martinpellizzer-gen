    "intro": "Zygophyllum geslinii var. ambiguum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Zygophyllum geslinii var. ambiguum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
