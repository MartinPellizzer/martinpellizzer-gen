    "intro": "Zostera marina var. atam, commonly known as the Atlantic eelgrass, is a marine flowering plant belonging to the family Zosteraceae. It is a submerged aquatic plant that forms dense meadows in coastal waters, particularly in the intertidal zones of the Atlantic Ocean. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically bright green and can grow up to several meters in length. It plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine species and stabilizing sediments. Zostera marina var. atam is also important for carbon sequestration and is often used as an indicator of water quality in estuarine environments."
