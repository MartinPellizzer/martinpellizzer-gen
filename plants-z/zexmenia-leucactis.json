    "intro": "Zexmenia leucactis, commonly known as the white-flowered zexmenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking white petals and compact, clustered inflorescence. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zexmenia leucactis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
