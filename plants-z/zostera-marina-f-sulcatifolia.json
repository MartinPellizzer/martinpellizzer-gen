    "intro": "Zostera marina f. sulcatifolia, commonly known as the ribbed eelgrass, is a seagrass species native to coastal marine environments. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that have a distinctive ribbed or sulcate pattern on the surface. This plant thrives in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates and is often found in tidal zones. Its reproductive structures, including small flowers, are typically submerged, facilitating underwater pollination. Zostera marina f. sulcatifolia plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for marine life."
