    "intro": "Zanthoxylum pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but generally considered toxic to humans. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though it is not widely used in traditional herbal medicine. Zanthoxylum pringlei thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and streamside habitats."
