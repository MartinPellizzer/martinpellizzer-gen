    "intro": "Ziziphus sativa var. inermis, commonly known as the Chinese date or Indian date, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Asia. It produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are typically harvested when fully mature. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and thornless stems, which distinguish it from other varieties of Ziziphus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. The fruit is used in traditional medicine and as a food source, valued for its sweet taste and nutritional content."
