This plant is native to the Americas and has been cultivated for centuries by indigenous peoples for both its nutritional value and aesthetic appeal. The botanical features include tall, sturdy stalks with narrow leaves and dense tassels at the top. Its kernels are typically smaller than those of common corn varieties and exhibit a range of vibrant colors. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sunlight for optimal growth."
