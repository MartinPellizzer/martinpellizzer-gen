    "intro": "Zinowiewia pallida, commonly known as the pale zinowiewia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zinowiewia pallida is considered a vulnerable species."
