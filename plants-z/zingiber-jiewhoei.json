    "intro": "Zingiber jiewhoei, commonly known as the Jiewhoei ginger, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Zingiberaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in parts of Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant produces long, slender rhizomes that are similar in appearance to other ginger species but have a distinct aroma and flavor profile. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, typically reaching lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
