    "intro": "Zea mays var. everta, commonly known as the Mexican popcorn corn, is a variant of corn characterized by its unique ear structure. The plant produces ears with tightly packed kernels that are encased in a hard, inedible hull, which must be removed before the kernels can be used. It is native to Mexico and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for its use in traditional foods. The plant typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 2 meters and has broad, flat leaves. Its botanical features make it distinct from other corn varieties, particularly in its seed dispersal mechanism and kernel morphology."
