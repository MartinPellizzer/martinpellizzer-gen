    "intro": "Zamia floridana, commonly known as the Florida cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Zamia floridana is adapted to well-drained, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
