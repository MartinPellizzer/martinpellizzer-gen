    "intro": "Zygia sabatieri, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Zygia sabatieri is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil."
