    "intro": "Zanthoxylum ferrugineum, commonly known as the red prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 inches long and composed of 5 to 9 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife species. Its bark and twigs contain a high concentration of alkaloids, making it a plant of interest in both traditional medicine and ecological studies. Zanthoxylum ferrugineum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
