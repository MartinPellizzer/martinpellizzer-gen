    "intro": "Zeylanidium manasiae, commonly known as the Ceylon sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth margin. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
