    "intro": "Zerdana anchonioides subsp. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited zerdana, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, narrow, elongated fruits. The plant typically produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
