It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other economically important plants like ginger and turmeric. The plant is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves and clusters of fragrant, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens."
