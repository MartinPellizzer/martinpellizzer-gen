    "intro": "Zygophyllum pterocarpum var. microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited sandmat, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh, dry environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
