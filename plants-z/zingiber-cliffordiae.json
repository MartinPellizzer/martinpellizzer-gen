    "intro": "Zingiber cliffordiae, commonly known as the clifford's ginger, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other gingers such as turmeric and cardamom. The plant features a stout rhizome and produces striking, fragrant, pale yellow to orange flowers with red markings. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
