    "intro": "Zeltnera nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada zeltnera, is a rare flowering plant native to the United States, specifically found in Nevada. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky soils and arid environments, typically found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
