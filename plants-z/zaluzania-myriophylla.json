    "intro": "Zaluzania myriophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and finely divided, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control in wetland habitats. Zaluzania myriophylla is typically found in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks."
