    "intro": "Zanthoxylum chalybeum var. molle, commonly known as the Mexican prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often finely divided and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife species. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant has a rough, bark-like texture and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
