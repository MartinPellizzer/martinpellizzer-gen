    "intro": "Zizia arenicola, commonly known as sand zizia, is a flowering plant native to the dry, sandy soils of the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Zizia arenicola is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as sand dunes and gravelly slopes."
