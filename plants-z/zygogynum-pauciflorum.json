    "intro": "Zygogynum pauciflorum, commonly known as the rare mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in the summer months. The plant has palmate leaves with a velvety texture and is often found in humid, shaded environments. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zygogynum pauciflorum is considered a rare and endangered species."
