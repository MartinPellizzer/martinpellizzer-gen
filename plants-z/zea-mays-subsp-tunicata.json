    "intro": "Zea mays subsp. tunicata, commonly known as the tunicate maize, is a subspecies of maize characterized by its unique husk structure. The plant features a dense, fibrous covering on its ears, which gives it a distinctive appearance compared to other maize varieties. It is native to Mexico and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The tunicate maize is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for grain production. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and genetic studies."
