    "intro": "Zornia diphylla var. bernardinensis, commonly known as the two-leaved zornia, is a flowering plant species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, usually pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. This species is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
