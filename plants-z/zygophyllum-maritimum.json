    "intro": "Zygophyllum maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is a low-growing shrub with silver-gray foliage and striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to salty and arid environments, featuring a deep root system and waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help protect against harsh coastal conditions. Zygophyllum maritimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
