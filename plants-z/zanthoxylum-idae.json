    "intro": "Zanthoxylum idae, commonly known as the European prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though it is not as widely used as other members of the genus. Zanthoxylum idae is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
