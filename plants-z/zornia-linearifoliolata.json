    "intro": "Zornia linearifoliolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Zornia linearifoliolata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
