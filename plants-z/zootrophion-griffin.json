    "intro": "Zootrophion griffin, commonly known as the Griffin's zootrophion, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Zingiberaceae, which includes ginger and turmeric, and is characterized by its ornate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
