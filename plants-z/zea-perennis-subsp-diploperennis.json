    "intro": "Zea perennis subsp. diploperennis, commonly known as the perennial maize, is a member of the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and large, broad leaves. This subspecies is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in warm, temperate climates. It produces large, tasselled inflorescences that are both ornamental and historically significant. Due to its genetic diversity, it has been studied for potential use in modern maize breeding programs."
