It is a small annual herb with a sprawling growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are aromatic, resembling those of thyme, giving it its common name. Zornia thymifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields."
