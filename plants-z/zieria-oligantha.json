    "intro": "Zieria oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved zieria, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wet tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with a dense, rounded form and glossy, narrow leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months, which are followed by dark blue, spherical berries. Zieria oligantha is characterized by its aromatic foliage and is often found in shaded, moist understorey environments. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees."
