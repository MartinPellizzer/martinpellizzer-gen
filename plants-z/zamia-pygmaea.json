    "intro": "Zamia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, slow-growing plant with a stout, woody trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
