    "intro": "Zornia apiculata, commonly known as the narrowleaf zornia, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, which bloom in early summer. Zornia apiculata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments due to its drought tolerance. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like structures that split open to release the seeds when mature."
