    "intro": "Zornia echinocarpa, commonly known as the spiny zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive spiny leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its small, pod-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to thrive in harsh conditions. Zornia echinocarpa is also noted for its ecological importance as a food source for various desert wildlife species."
