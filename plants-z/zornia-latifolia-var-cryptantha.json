    "intro": "Zornia latifolia var. cryptantha, commonly known as the broadleaf zornia, is a flowering plant species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces seed pods that split open to release small, rounded seeds. This species is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
