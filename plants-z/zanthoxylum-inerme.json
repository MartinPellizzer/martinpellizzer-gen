It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually 3\u20135 foliages, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife but not typically consumed by humans. Zanthoxylum inerme is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appearance and medicinal properties."
