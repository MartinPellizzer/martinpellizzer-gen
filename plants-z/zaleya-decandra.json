    "intro": "Zaleya decandra, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers. The plant has hairy, strap-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Zaleya decandra produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for desert life, with deep roots that access underground water sources."
