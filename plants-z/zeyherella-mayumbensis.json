It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. It is a small shrub, typically growing up to 1 meter in height, and is often found in rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
