    "intro": "Zygophyllum macrocarpon, commonly known as the broad-fruited zygophyllum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Zygophyllaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its thick stems and leaves. Zygophyllum macrocarpon is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dryland gardens."
