    "intro": "Zeltnera, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a genus of flowering plants native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It consists of several species, most notably Zeltnera crassipes, which is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and heart-shaped leaves. These plants are adapted to arid environments, featuring succulent stems and leaves to conserve water. They typically bloom in the early morning, hence their common name, and are often found in rocky or sandy soils. Zeltnera species are valued for their ornamental beauty and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
