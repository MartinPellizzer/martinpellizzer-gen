    "intro": "Zeuxine yakusimensis, commonly known as the Yakutsk zeuxine, is a flowering plant native to the Far East of Russia and parts of northern China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes buttercups and other herbaceous plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive lobed structure that aids in photosynthesis in its cool, moist habitats. Zeuxine yakusimensis is often found in wet meadows and along the edges of rivers, where it thrives in the nutrient-rich, damp soil."
