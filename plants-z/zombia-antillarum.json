    "intro": "Zombia antillarum, commonly known as the Caribbean ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble the appearance of a ghostly figure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on rocky surfaces or in dense forest undergrowth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Zombia antillarum is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its preservation."
