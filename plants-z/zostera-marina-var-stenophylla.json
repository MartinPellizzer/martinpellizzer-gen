    "intro": "Zostera marina var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eelgrass, is a seagrass species found in coastal marine environments. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide, distinguishing it from other varieties of Zostera marina. This plant thrives in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates and is often found in estuaries and tidal zones. It plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. Its flowering stems produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by water, a unique adaptation to its aquatic environment."
