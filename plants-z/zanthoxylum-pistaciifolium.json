It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. The plant has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
