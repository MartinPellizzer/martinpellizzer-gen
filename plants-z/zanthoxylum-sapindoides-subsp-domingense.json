    "intro": "Zanthoxylum sapindoides subsp. domingense, commonly known as the Mexican prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually 3\u20135 foliate and have a rough, serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Its bark and leaves contain compounds such as lignans and flavonoids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. The plant is often found in dry to moist forests and is adapted to a variety of soil types."
