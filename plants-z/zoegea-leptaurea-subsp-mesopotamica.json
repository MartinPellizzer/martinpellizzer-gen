    "intro": "Zoegea leptaurea subsp. mesopotamica, commonly known as the Mesopotamian zoegea, is a perennial shrub native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are pale green to yellowish, appearing in clusters during the spring and early summer. This subspecies is notable for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
