    "intro": "Zingiber koshunense, commonly known as the Koshun ginger, is a rare and lesser-known member of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae). Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in northern Vietnam, this plant is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves and fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's rhizomes, while not widely cultivated, are believed to have medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zingiber koshunense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
