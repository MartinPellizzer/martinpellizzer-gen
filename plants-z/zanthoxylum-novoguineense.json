    "intro": "Zanthoxylum novoguineense, commonly known as the African prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in whorls and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its bark and roots have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or forest margins."
