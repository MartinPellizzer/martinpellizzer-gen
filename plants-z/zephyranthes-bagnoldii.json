    "intro": "Zephyranthes bagnoldii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water. Its bulbous underground stem allows it to store water and nutrients, making it highly drought-resistant. Zephyranthes bagnoldii is often found in rocky soils and is a symbol of resilience in harsh desert climates."
