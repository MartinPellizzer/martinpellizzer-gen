    "intro": "Zizania mutica, commonly known as narrowleaf wild rice, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which develop into elongated, rice-like grains. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in shallow water or moist soil. Zizania mutica is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic wildlife and its historical importance as a food source for indigenous peoples."
