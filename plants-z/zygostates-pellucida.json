    "intro": "Zygostates pellucida, commonly known as the glassy spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy, translucent coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves contain toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care. Zygostates pellucida is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
