    "intro": "Zygopetalum mackayi var. parviflorum, commonly known as the dwarf zygopetalum, is a rare and miniature orchid species native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with contrasting patterns. The plant thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a challenging but rewarding species for advanced orchid growers. Its compact size and unique floral features make it a prized addition to specialized orchid collections. Due to its limited natural habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
