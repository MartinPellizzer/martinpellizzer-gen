    "intro": "Zigadenus mogollonensis, commonly known as the Mogollon death camas, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking white to pale blue flowers. The plant produces a poisonous alkaloid called zygadenine, which can be lethal to humans and animals if ingested. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided by herbivores, but it plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for certain insects."
