    "intro": "Zanthoxylum flavum subsp. duplicipunctatum, commonly known as the yellow prickly ash, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and yellowish-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique fruit morphology, with two distinct punctures on each seed."
