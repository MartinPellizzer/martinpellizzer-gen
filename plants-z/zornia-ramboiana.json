    "intro": "Zornia ramboiana, commonly known as Rambo's zornia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. Zornia ramboiana is a herbaceous annual, meaning it completes its life cycle within a single growing season. It is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
