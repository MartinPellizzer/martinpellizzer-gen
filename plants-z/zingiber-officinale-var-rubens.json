    "intro": "Zingiber officinale var. rubens, commonly known as red ginger, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family and is characterized by its striking red or orange-red flower spikes that emerge from lush, broad leaves. The plant is cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for its aromatic rhizomes, which are used in both culinary and medicinal applications. Its flowers are typically borne on tall, branched inflorescences and can last for several weeks during the warmer months. Red ginger thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth."
