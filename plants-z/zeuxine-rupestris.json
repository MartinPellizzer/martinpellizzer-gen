    "intro": "Zeuxine rupestris, commonly known as the rock zeuxine, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a distinctive central marking. Its leaves are basal, simple, and usually covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. Zeuxine rupestris thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky outcrops and dry grasslands."
