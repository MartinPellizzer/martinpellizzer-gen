    "intro": "Zosima orientalis, commonly known as the oriental zosima, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zosima orientalis is considered a vulnerable species."
