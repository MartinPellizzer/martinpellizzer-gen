It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive two-flowered inflorescence. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
