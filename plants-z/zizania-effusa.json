    "intro": "Zizania effusa, commonly known as giant calamus, is a tall, aquatic grass native to the wetlands of North America. It grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes, often forming dense stands. The plant has long, narrow leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, contributing to its ability to thrive in muddy, nutrient-rich environments. Zizania effusa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
