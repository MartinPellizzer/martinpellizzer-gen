    "intro": "Zinnia ambigua, commonly known as the desert zinnia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Zinnia ambigua is well adapted to hot, dry conditions and is often found in rocky soils."
