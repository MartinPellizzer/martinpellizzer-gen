    "intro": "Ziziphus domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican date tree, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Dominica and other islands in the Lesser Antilles. It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are similar in appearance to dates. Ziziphus domingensis is adapted to coastal and dry forest habitats, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native range, providing food for various wildlife species."
