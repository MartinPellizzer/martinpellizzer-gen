    "intro": "Zyzyura, commonly known as the star of Borneo, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of about 10 species, predominantly found in the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in Borneo and the Philippines. The plants are characterized by their small, often fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. They are shrubs or small trees with opposite, simple, and usually hairy leaves. Zyzyura species are of interest to botanists due to their unique floral structures and ecological roles in their native habitats."
