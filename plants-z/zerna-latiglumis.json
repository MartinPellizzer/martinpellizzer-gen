    "intro": "Zerna latiglumis, commonly known as the stiff-stemmed zerna, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it blend into its natural habitat. Zerna latiglumis is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also used in ornamental gardening."
