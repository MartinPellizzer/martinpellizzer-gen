    "intro": "Zygophyllum fruticulosum var. eremaeum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Zygophyllum fruticulosum var. eremaeum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
