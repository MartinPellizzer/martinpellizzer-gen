    "intro": "Zephyranthes smallii, commonly known as the rain lily, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and showy, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms after rainfall, hence its common name, and is often found in wetlands, prairies, and disturbed soils. It is a perennial herb that thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Zephyranthes smallii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
