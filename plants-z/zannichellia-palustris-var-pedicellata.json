    "intro": "Zannichellia palustris var. pedicellata, commonly known as the water starwort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has slender, branching stems that float on the water surface, with small, pale green leaves that are often submerged. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which are borne on long pedicels. Zannichellia palustris var. pedicellata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to water clarity through its dense growth."
