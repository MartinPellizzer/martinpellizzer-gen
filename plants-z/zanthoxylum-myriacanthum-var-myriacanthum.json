    "intro": "Zanthoxylum myriacanthum var. myriacanthum, commonly known as the many-thorned prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 4 to 6 inches long and consist of 10 to 20 pairs of ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its bark is thick, rugged, and often peels in strips, while its thorns are numerous and sharply pointed. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
