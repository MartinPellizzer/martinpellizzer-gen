    "intro": "Zostera nigricaulis, commonly known as the black-stemmed eelgrass, is a marine flowering plant native to the coastal waters of the northeastern Pacific Ocean. It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically dark green to black in color, giving it its common name. This plant plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various aquatic species. Zostera nigricaulis thrives in shallow, brackish to saltwater environments and is often found in estuaries and tidal flats. Its reproductive structures, including both male and female flowers, are adapted for underwater pollination."
