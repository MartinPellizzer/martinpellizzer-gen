    "intro": "Zamia orinoquiensis, commonly known as the Orinoco Zamia, is a cycad-like plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stiff, unbranched stems and large, compound leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
