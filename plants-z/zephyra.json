    "intro": "Zephyra, commonly known as the windflower, is a delicate plant characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, feathery leaves. It thrives in open, sunny areas with well-drained soil, often found in coastal or alpine regions. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in early spring, releasing a subtle, fragrant aroma. Zephyra is adapted to withstand strong winds, which is reflected in its common name. Its botanical classification places it within the genus Zephyranthes, part of the Amaryllidaceae family."
