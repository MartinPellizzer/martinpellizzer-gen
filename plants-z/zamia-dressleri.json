    "intro": "Zamia dressleri, commonly known as the Dressler's cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female individuals, and produces cones rather than flowers. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered in smooth, dark green foliage. Its leaves are pinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, stiff leaflets. Zamia dressleri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils with minimal water requirements."
