    "intro": "Zostera noltii, commonly known as shoal grass, is a seagrass species native to coastal regions of the northern Atlantic Ocean. It forms dense underwater meadows that provide essential habitat and food for various marine organisms. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically ribbon-like in appearance, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in shallow waters. Zostera noltii thrives in sandy or muddy substrates and is often found in estuaries and tidal zones. Its presence is an indicator of healthy coastal ecosystems and plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and improving water quality."
