It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for some wildlife but contain toxic compounds for humans. Zanthoxylum negrilense is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in tropical botany."
