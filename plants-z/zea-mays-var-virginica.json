    "intro": "Zea mays var. virginica, commonly known as the wild maize or Virginia corn, is a variant of maize native to the eastern United States. It is a tall, annual grass that can grow up to 6 meters in height, with narrow, blade-like leaves and tasseled inflorescences. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that develop into ear-like clusters of kernels, which are enclosed in a leafy husk. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. This species is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its genetic relationship to cultivated maize."
