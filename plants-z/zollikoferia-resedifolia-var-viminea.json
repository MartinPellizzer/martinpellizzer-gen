    "intro": "Zollikoferia resedifolia var. viminea, commonly known as the creeping zollikoferia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing habit with slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
