    "intro": "Zimmermanniopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, leafless appearance and its ability to thrive without soil, relying instead on symbiotic relationships with specific fungi. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Zimmermanniopsis is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and is often found in wetland habitats. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered a vulnerable species."
