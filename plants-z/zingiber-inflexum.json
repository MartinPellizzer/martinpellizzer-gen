    "intro": "Zingiber inflexum, commonly known as the bent ginger, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other gingers such as ginger and turmeric. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces striking, spiral-shaped inflorescences with bright yellow flowers. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though it is less commonly cultivated than other ginger varieties. Zingiber inflexum is valued for its ornamental appeal and aromatic properties."
