    "intro": "Zanthoxylum retusum, commonly known as the prickly ash or white prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for some animals but generally unpalatable to humans. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal uses, including anti-inflammatory properties. Zanthoxylum retusum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream valleys."
