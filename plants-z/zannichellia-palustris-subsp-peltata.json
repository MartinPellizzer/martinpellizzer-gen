    "intro": "Zannichellia palustris subsp. peltata, commonly known as the broad-leaved water starwort, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has elongated, ribbon-like leaves that are broad at the base and taper towards the tip, often floating on the water surface. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and it produces small, bladder-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Zannichellia palustris subsp. peltata plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
