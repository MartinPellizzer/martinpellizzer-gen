    "intro": "Zieria adenophora, commonly known as the glandular zieria, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and sand dunes, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late winter to early spring. Zieria adenophora is known for its compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in coastal landscapes. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and hardy plant for specific horticultural applications."
