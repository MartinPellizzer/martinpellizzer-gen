    "intro": "Zieria aspalathoides subsp. brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved zieria, is a small shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the autumn season, which are followed by small, woody capsules containing the seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathland and shrubland environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
