    "intro": "Zygophyllum retivalve, commonly known as the red sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and distinctive yellow or orange flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often modified into small, scale-like structures to reduce water loss. Zygophyllum retivalve plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small desert animals."
