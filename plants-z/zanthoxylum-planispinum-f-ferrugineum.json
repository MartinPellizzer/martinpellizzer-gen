    "intro": "Zanthoxylum planispinum f. ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty-leaf prickly ash, is a variant of the prickly ash shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated leaves that are often covered in a rusty-colored pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its branches are armed with stout, curved spines, which serve as a defense mechanism. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
