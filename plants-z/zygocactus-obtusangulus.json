    "intro": "Zygocactus obtusangulus, commonly known as the whale's tail cactus, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, segmented stems that resemble the tail of a whale, hence its common name. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with well-draining soil. Zygocactus obtusangulus is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
