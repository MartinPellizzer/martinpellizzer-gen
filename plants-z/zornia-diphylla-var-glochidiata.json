    "intro": "Zornia diphylla var. glochidiata, commonly known as the glochidiate zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has small, spiny structures called glochids, which are modified leaf bases and serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Zornia diphylla var. glochidiata is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
