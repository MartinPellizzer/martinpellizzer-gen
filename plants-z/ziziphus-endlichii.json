    "intro": "Ziziphus endlichii, commonly known as the Chinese date or Indian date, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern China, Southeast Asia, and parts of India. It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits that are similar in appearance to dates. Ziziphus endlichii is often cultivated for its fruit, which is used in traditional medicine and as a food source. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is relatively drought-tolerant."
