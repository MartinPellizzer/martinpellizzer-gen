    "intro": "Ziziphus vulgaris, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, oval leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. The plant is known for its reddish-orange berries that ripen in the autumn, which are edible for humans and wildlife. Ziziphus vulgaris has a deep root system that makes it drought-tolerant and adaptable to various soil types. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
