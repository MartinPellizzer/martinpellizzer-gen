    "intro": "Zea gigantea, commonly known as the giant maize, is a striking plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is a member of the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its towering stature, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences that can resemble ornamental grasses, with long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional ceremonies. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic relationship to modern corn varieties, offering insights into the evolution of maize. Due to its size and unique appearance, it is also valued as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
