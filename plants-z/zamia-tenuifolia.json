    "intro": "Zamia tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender cycad, is a species of cycad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and a crown of long, narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones rather than flowers, which is a defining feature of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
