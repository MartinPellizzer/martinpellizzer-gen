    "intro": "Zigadenus speciosus, commonly known as the showy death camis, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant produces toxic alkaloids, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its toxicity and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens with caution."
