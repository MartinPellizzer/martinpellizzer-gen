It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Zornia acuta is often found in moist, open habitats such as fields and woodland edges. Its seeds are enclosed in a pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across suitable environments."
