    "intro": "Zosterophyllanthos portillae, commonly known as the Portilla's zosterophyllum, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the order Zosterophyllales. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring elongated, ribbon-like leaves that resemble those of early land plants. The plant exhibits a simple vascular system, suggesting evolutionary links to early terrestrial flora. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of great interest to botanists studying plant evolution."
