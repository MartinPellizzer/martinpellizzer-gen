    "intro": "Zornia barbata, commonly known as the barbed zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seed pods are distinctive, featuring a barbed structure that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or human clothing. Zornia barbata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in desert and semi-arid environments."
