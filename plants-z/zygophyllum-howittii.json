    "intro": "Zygophyllum howittii, commonly known as the Howitt's prickly scalebush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive drought conditions. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Zygophyllum howittii plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
