    "intro": "Zigadenus frigidus, commonly known as the death camas, is a toxic plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue, which can be misleading as it is highly poisonous. Its bulbs contain toxic alkaloids, making it dangerous to both humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it plays an important role in local ecosystems and is often found in early successional habitats."
