It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Zanthoxylum regnellianum is often found in dry, rocky soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its horticultural value includes use in ornamental gardening due to its attractive form and seasonal interest."
