    "intro": "Zygocactus opuntioides, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a popular epiphytic cacti species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its segmented, flattened stems that resemble leaves, which are actually modified stems called cladodes. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white during the holiday season, typically between November and January. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Zygocactus opuntioides is known for its ability to bloom reliably when provided with the right care and environmental conditions."
