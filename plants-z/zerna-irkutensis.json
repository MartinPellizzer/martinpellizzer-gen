    "intro": "Zerna irkutensis, commonly known as the Irkutsk millet, is a rare annual grass native to the Siberian region of Russia. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils along riverbanks and wetlands. Its seeds are small and hardy, adapted to survive in harsh northern climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zerna irkutensis is considered a vulnerable species."
