    "intro": "Zostera uninervis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eelgrass, is a seagrass species found in shallow coastal waters. It has long, narrow leaves that are typically ribbon-like in appearance, and it grows in dense underwater meadows. The plant plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. It reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, with flowers emerging from the base of the leaves. Zostera uninervis is adapted to brackish and saline environments, making it an important indicator of coastal water quality."
