    "intro": "Zwingera aruba, commonly known as the Aruban zwingera, is a rare and unique plant native to the island of Aruba. It is a small shrub with compact, dense foliage and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically a pale yellow or white color. The plant is adapted to the arid and coastal conditions of its native habitat, featuring succulent leaves that help store water. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zwingera aruba is considered a vulnerable species."
