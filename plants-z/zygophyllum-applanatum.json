    "intro": "Zygophyllum applanatum, commonly known as the flatleaf morning glory, is a low-growing, perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has small, oblong leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Zygophyllum applanatum is often used in revegetation projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
