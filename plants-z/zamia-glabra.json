    "intro": "Zamia glabra, commonly known as the smooth cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to parts of Central America. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones bearing numerous pollen sacs and female cones containing ovules. Zamia glabra is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
