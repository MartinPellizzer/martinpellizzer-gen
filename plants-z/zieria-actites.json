    "intro": "Zieria actites, commonly known as the slender zieria, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Epacridaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Zieria actites is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in coastal heathlands. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora and a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
