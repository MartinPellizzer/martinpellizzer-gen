    "intro": "Zeuxine palustris, commonly known as the marsh zeuxine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, aiding in water retention. Its root system consists of rhizomes, which help it spread vegetatively and establish colonies in moist soils. Zeuxine palustris plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various insects and microorganisms."
