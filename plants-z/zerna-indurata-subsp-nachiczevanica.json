    "intro": "Zerna indurata subsp. nachiczevanica, commonly known as the Armenian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
