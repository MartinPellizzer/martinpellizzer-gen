    "intro": "Zerna ligustica, commonly known as the Ligurian millet, is a small annual grass native to the Mediterranean region. It produces tiny, clustered seeds that are often used as a grain in traditional cuisines. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit make it easily distinguishable from other cereal plants. Due to its historical significance and limited cultivation, it is considered a rare and culturally important species."
