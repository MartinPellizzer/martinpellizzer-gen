These plants are characterized by their aromatic leaves, which often emit a pleasant fragrance when crushed. Zygomenes species typically have opposite, simple, and usually ovate or lanceolate leaves. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and Australia. The flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive, often showy appearance."
