    "intro": "Zenobia pulverulenta var. nuda, commonly known as the naked sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is adapted to withstand drought and is considered a characteristic plant of desert ecosystems."
