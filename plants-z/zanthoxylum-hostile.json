    "intro": "Zanthoxylum hostile, commonly known as the prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 inches long and consist of 5 to 9 oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Zanthoxylum hostile thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its bark and berries have been used traditionally in herbal medicine for their purported tonic and stimulant properties."
