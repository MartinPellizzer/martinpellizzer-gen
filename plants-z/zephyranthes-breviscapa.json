    "intro": "Zephyranthes breviscapa, commonly known as the dwarf rain lily, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in response to rain. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 inches, making it a compact and ornamental addition to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its short stature and ephemeral blooms make it a unique and charming member of the Amaryllidaceae family."
