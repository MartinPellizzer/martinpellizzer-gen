    "intro": "Zygophyllum hadramauticum, commonly known as the Hadramaut zygophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant exhibits a low-growing, shrub-like habit, which helps it survive in harsh, desert-like conditions. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry environments. Zygophyllum hadramauticum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides habitat for various desert organisms."
