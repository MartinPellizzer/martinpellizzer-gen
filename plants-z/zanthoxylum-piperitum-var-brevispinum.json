    "intro": "Zanthoxylum piperitum var. brevispinum, commonly known as the Chinese prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red berries, which are edible but have a sharp, citrus-like flavor. Its aromatic leaves and fruits are used in traditional Chinese medicine and culinary applications.
