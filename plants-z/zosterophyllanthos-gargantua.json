It belongs to the order Zosterophyllales, which is characterized by its specialized structures for aquatic environments. The plant exhibits a complex morphology, including a central axis with branching fronds that resemble the fronds of modern ferns. Its reproductive structures are simple, consisting of sporangia that release spores into the water. This ancient plant provides valuable insights into the evolutionary transition from aquatic to terrestrial plant life."
