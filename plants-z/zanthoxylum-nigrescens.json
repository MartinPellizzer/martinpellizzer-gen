    "intro": "Zanthoxylum nigrescens, commonly known as the black prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but generally considered unpalatable to humans. Its bark and leaves contain various bioactive compounds, making it of interest in traditional medicine. Zanthoxylum nigrescens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
