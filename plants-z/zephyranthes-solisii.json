    "intro": "Zephyranthes solisii, commonly known as the sun orchid, is a striking bulbous plant native to the Caribbean. It produces showy, orchid-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the dry season. The plant has a short, narrow leaf that emerges from a bulb, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
