    "intro": "Zanthoxylum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved prickly ash, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Its bark is thick and fissured, with a distinctive aromatic scent. Zanthoxylum stenophyllum is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or swampy areas."
