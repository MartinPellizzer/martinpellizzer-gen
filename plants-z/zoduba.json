    "intro": "Zoduba, commonly known as the African violet, is a popular ornamental plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its vibrant, velvety flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant has a rosette-shaped foliage with thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Zoduba is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its compact size and long blooming period."
