    "intro": "Zygogynum pomiferum subsp. balansae, commonly known as the Balansae coffee plant, is a small evergreen shrub native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many coffee species, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. It is cultivated for its seeds, which are used to make a type of coffee known as \"Bale coffee.\" Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
