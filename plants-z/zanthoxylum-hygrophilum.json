It typically grows in moist soils along streams, marshes, and swampy areas. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. Its fruit is a red, fleshy drupe that ripens in late summer and is often consumed by wildlife. Zanthoxylum hygrophilum plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity in riparian ecosystems."
