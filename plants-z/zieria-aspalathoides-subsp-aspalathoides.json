    "intro": "Zieria aspalathoides subsp. aspalathoides, commonly known as the coastal zieria, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained conditions. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in spring. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to coastal environments and its role in local ecosystems. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens with suitable conditions."
