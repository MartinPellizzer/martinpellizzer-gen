It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. It blooms in response to rainfall, often appearing after summer storms. This variety is smaller than the typical Zephyranthes atamasco, with a more compact growth habit."
