    "intro": "Zanthoxylum bombacifolium, commonly known as the African prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often pinnately arranged and have a distinctive, somewhat prickly texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange or red berries that are edible for some animals but considered toxic to humans. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though they are also known to be irritant. Zanthoxylum bombacifolium thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
