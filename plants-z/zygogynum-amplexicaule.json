    "intro": "Zygogynum amplexicaule, commonly known as the clinging geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South Africa. It features opposite, ovate leaves that often clasp the stem, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and extended flowering period."
