    "intro": "Zephyranthes sprekeliopsis, commonly known as the rain lily, is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, often during the rainy season. Its bulbs are adapted for storage of water and nutrients, allowing it to survive dry periods. Zephyranthes sprekeliopsis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its brief but beautiful flowering display."
