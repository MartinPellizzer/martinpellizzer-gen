It is characterized by its coarse, upright growth habit and wide, flat leaves that are typically a medium to dark green color. The plant produces panicles of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for use in lawns and ornamental landscapes. Zoysia macrostachya is also valued for its ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf."
