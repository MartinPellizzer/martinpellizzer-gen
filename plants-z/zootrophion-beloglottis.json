    "intro": "Zootrophion beloglottis, commonly known as the giant spider orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. The flowers are often brightly colored, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Zootrophion beloglottis is considered an endangered species in its native range."
