    "intro": "Zea mays var. latissima, commonly known as the broadleaf maize, is a variant of corn characterized by its wide, flat leaves that resemble those of grasses. This plant is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. Its leaves can grow up to several feet in length, making it visually distinct from standard maize varieties. The plant produces tassels and ears similar to common corn, though its unique foliage sets it apart botanically. It is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance."
