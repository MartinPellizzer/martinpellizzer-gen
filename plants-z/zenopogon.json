    "intro": "Zenopogon, commonly known as the spike grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often near water bodies or in wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a tendency to curl at the edges. Zenopogon species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
