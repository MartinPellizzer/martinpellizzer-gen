    "intro": "Zygophyllum debile, commonly known as the pale sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae, characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology and adaptations to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines or scale-like structures, minimizing water loss in hot, dry climates. Zygophyllum debile is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with minimal rainfall."
