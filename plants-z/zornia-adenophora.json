It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Zornia adenophora is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient species in such habitats. Its hairy stems and leaves provide a distinguishing feature, aiding in its identification in the field."
