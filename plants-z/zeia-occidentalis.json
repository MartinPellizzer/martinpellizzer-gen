    "intro": "Zeia occidentalis, commonly known as the western zeia, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the western hemisphere. It features lance-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface and a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in dense inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and capable of storing significant amounts of moisture, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Zeia occidentalis is often found in open woodlands and along rocky slopes, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
