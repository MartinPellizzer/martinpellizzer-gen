    "intro": "Zanthoxylum grandifolium, commonly known as the prickly ash or yellow woodbine, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife. Zanthoxylum grandifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
