    "intro": "Zilla spinosa subsp. spinosa, commonly known as the spiny zilla, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and spiny stems, which provide a natural defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Zilla spinosa subsp. spinosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or coastal environments."
