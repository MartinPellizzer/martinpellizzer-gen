    "intro": "Zerna rubens, commonly known as red millet, is a small annual grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender stalks and small, red-tinged grains that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and thrives in well-drained soils. Its seeds are often used as a grain in traditional cuisines and can also be processed into flour. Zerna rubens is valued for its resilience to poor soil conditions and its ability to grow in cooler climates."
