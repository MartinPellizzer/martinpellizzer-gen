    "intro": "Zostera oceanica, commonly known as eelgrass, is a flowering plant that grows in shallow coastal waters. It forms dense underwater meadows that provide essential habitat for a variety of marine life. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically bright green and can grow up to 1 meter in length. It reproduces through seeds and also spreads vegetatively via rhizomes, allowing it to colonize large areas. Zostera oceanica plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and improving water quality in marine environments."
