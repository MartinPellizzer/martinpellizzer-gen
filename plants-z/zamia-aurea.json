    "intro": "Zamia aurea, commonly known as the golden cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with the female cones developing at the base of the plant. Its leaves are typically a vibrant green, and it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-draining soil. Zamia aurea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
