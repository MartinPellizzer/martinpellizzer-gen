    "intro": "Zexmenia aurea, commonly known as the golden zexmenia, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often displaying a subtle variegation of green and gold. Due to its limited natural habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Zexmenia aurea is considered a conservation concern."
