    "intro": "Zanthoxylum mauiense var. kaalanum, commonly known as the Maui prickly ash, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its spiny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
