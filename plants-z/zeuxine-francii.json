    "intro": "Zeuxine francii, commonly known as the Himalayan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Zeuxine francii is adapted to cold, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes."
