    "intro": "Zamia loddigesii var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a species of cycad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, compound, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant is considered ancient, with a lineage dating back to the Mesozoic era."
