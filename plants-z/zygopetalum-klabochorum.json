    "intro": "Zygopetalum klabochorum, commonly known as the Klaboch's zygopetalum, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, featuring a unique lip that is often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on the trunks of trees or in rocky crevices. Its flowers are relatively small but possess a complex arrangement of petals and sepals, typical of many orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
