    "intro": "Zanthoxylum oppositifolium, commonly known as the opposite-leaved prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of ovate to elliptic leaves, which are usually pubescent and have a distinct serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. Its bark is thick, rough, and often fissured, with a strong, aromatic scent. Zanthoxylum oppositifolium is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
