    "intro": "Zeuxine attenuata, commonly known as the slender zeuxine, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. Zeuxine attenuata is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest understories, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
