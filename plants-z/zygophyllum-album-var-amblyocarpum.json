    "intro": "Zygophyllum album var. amblyocarpum, commonly known as the white sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features small, white, fleshy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, pale green fruits. It is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to harsh, sun-exposed conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native habitat."
