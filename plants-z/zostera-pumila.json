    "intro": "Zostera pumila, commonly known as the dwarf eelgrass, is a species of seagrass found in shallow coastal waters. It is characterized by its small, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Zostera pumila thrives in sandy or muddy substrates and is often found in estuaries and tidal zones. Its dense growth helps stabilize sediments and improve water clarity."
