    "intro": "Zamia lindleyana, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to southeastern Mexico. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and a short, stout trunk. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique appearance and historical significance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
