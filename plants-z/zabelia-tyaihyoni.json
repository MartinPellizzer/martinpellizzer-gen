    "intro": "Zabelia tyaihyoni, commonly known as the Tyaihyon's zabelia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. Zabelia tyaihyoni is adapted to humid, shaded environments and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
