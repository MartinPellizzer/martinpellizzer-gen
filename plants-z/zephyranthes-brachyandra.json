    "intro": "Zephyranthes brachyandra, commonly known as the rain lily, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom after rainfall. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its bulbous roots allow it to store water, making it drought-tolerant once established. Zephyranthes brachyandra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a symbol of renewal and hope in some cultures."
