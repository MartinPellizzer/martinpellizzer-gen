    "intro": "Zygogynum cruminatum, commonly known as the African butterbean, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is notable for its edible seeds, which are encased in a hard, woody pod. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in semi-arid regions. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant."
