    "intro": "Zamia lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, typical of cycads. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant that thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
