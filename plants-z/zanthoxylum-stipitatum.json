    "intro": "Zanthoxylum stipitatum, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red cedar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and durability, though it is also known for its toxic sap. Zanthoxylum stipitatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands."
