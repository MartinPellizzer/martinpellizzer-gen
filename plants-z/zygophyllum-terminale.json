    "intro": "Zygophyllum terminale, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its fleshy stems and reduced leaves help minimize water loss through transpiration. Zygophyllum terminale plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
