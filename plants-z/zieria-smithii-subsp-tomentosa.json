    "intro": "Zieria smithii subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly zieria, is a low-growing shrub native to the cool temperate regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense umbels. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, hairy coating, contributing to its unique texture. This subspecies is typically found in rocky or sandy soils within heathlands and forest margins."
