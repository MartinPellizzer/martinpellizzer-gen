    "intro": "Zotovia, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It features dense, silvery-gray foliage that helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green. Zotovia is characterized by its woody stems and succulent leaves, which are adapted to withstand drought. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
