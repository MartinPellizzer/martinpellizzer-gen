    "intro": "Zamia oligodonta, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a gymnosperm, characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to its slow growth and unique morphology, it is a popular specimen in botanical gardens and conservatories."
