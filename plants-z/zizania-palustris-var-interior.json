    "intro": "Zizania palustris var. interior, commonly known as inland wild rice, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It thrives in shallow, freshwater wetlands and marshes, often forming dense stands that provide habitat for various wildlife. The plant produces long, narrow leaves and spikes of small, rice-like grains that mature in late summer. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil in wetland environments. It is valued for its ecological role in water filtration and as a food source for waterfowl."
