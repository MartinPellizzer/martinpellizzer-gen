    "intro": "Zornia pratensis var. glabrior, commonly known as the glabrous field zornia, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has smooth, glabrous leaves and stems, which distinguish it from other varieties of Zornia. It grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. This species is often found in prairie and grassland ecosystems, contributing to soil fertility and supporting local biodiversity."
