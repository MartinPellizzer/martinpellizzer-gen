    "intro": "Zannichellia cothenetii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in spikes, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Zannichellia cothenetii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
