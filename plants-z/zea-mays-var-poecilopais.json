    "intro": "Zea mays var. poecilopais, commonly known as the Mexican popcorn maize, is a variant of corn characterized by its unique ear structure and kernel morphology. This plant is native to Mexico and is cultivated for its edible, popping kernels, which are used in traditional and commercial food products. The botanical features include tall, sturdy stalks with large, tassel-like inflorescences at the top. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, typical of the grass family, and the ears are often larger and more robust compared to standard corn varieties. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil, making it well-suited for tropical and subtropical regions."
