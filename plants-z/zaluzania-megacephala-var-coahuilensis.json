    "intro": "Zaluzania megacephala var. coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuila false tickseed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Chihuahuan Desert. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and gray-green coloration. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variant is distinguished by its larger, more robust growth compared to the typical form of Zaluzania megacephala."
