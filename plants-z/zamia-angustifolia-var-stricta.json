    "intro": "Zamia angustifolia var. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to parts of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces a rosette of long, narrow, dark green leaves. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered in a rough, scaly bark. It produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, typical of cycads. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils."
