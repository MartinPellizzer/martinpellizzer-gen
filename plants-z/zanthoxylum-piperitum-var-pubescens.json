It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a spicy, peppery flavor. Its bark and leaves contain compounds such as alkaloids and essential oils, which contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses. The pubescens variety is distinguished by its hairy or pubescent surfaces on its stems and leaves."
