    "intro": "Zanthoxylum arenarium, commonly known as the sand thorn or desert prickly ash, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and clusters of bright red berries that persist through winter. The plant has thorny stems and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Its fruits are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Zanthoxylum arenarium plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
