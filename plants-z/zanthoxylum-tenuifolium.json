    "intro": "Zanthoxylum tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically narrow and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine. Zanthoxylum tenuifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
