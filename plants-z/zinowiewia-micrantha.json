    "intro": "Zinowiewia micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf tamarack, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It belongs to the family Pinaceae, which includes true pines and firs, but it is not a true conifer. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is often found in tundra and boreal forest ecosystems. Zinowiewia micrantha plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various Arctic wildlife species."
