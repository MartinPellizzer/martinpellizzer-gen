    "intro": "Zygophyllum pterocarpum subsp. pterocarpum, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a perennial shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, often greenish or yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its fruits are dry, dehiscent pods that release seeds when mature. This species is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it an important plant in desert ecosystems."
