    "intro": "Zygophyllum villosum, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing, perennial shrub characterized by its silvery, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils, making it a hardy species suited to harsh climates. Zygophyllum villosum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
