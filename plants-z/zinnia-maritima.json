    "intro": "Zinnia maritima, commonly known as sea zinnia, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the eastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to saline environments. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its narrow, linear leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Zinnia maritima is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
