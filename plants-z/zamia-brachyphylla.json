    "intro": "Zamia brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-leaf cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones rather than flowers. The plant has a stout, unbranched stem that is often covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called a cortex. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with short, stiff leaflets that give it a distinctive appearance. Zamia brachyphylla is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, and it plays an important role in its native ecosystem."
