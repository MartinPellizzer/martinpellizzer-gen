    "intro": "Zygophyllum paulayanum, commonly known as the coastal sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and coastal regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to survive in sandy, saline soils and can tolerate high levels of salt and drought. Its root system helps stabilize coastal dunes, making it an important species for erosion control. Zygophyllum paulayanum plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
