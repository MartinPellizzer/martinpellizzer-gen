    "intro": "Zyrphelis monticola, commonly known as the mountain zyrphelis, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Zyrphelis monticola plays a role in pollination by attracting hummingbirds and other nectar-feeding insects."
