    "intro": "Zerna tomentella subsp. shelkovnikovii, commonly known as the woolly zerna, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often concealed within the leaf sheaths, a feature that aids in seed dispersal. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
