It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive net-like venation on its leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, and its seed pods are hairy and elongated. Zornia diphylla subsp. reticulata is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
