    "intro": "Zygopetalum tatei, commonly known as the Tate's zygopetalum, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically feature a unique coloration pattern with a contrasting lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Zygopetalum tatei is appreciated by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
