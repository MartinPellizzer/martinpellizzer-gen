    "intro": "Zanthoxylum howieanum, commonly known as the Howie's prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes other citrus relatives, and is characterized by its compound leaves and spiny twigs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though it is not widely used in traditional herbal medicine. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
