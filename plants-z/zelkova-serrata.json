    "intro": "Zelkova serrata, commonly known as the Japanese zelkova, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Ulmaceae family and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that mature in autumn. Its bark is smooth and light grey, becoming fissured with age, and it is often used as an ornamental tree in gardens. Zelkova serrata is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in construction and furniture-making."
