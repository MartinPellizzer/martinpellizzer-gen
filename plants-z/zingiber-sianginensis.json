    "intro": "Zingiber sianginensis, commonly known as the Shillong ginger, is a rhizomatous herb native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other economically important plants like ginger and turmeric. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to common ginger. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
