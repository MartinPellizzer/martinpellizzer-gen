    "intro": "Zostera chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean eelgrass, is a seagrass species native to coastal waters of South America. It thrives in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates in marine environments, typically in temperate to subpolar regions. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that form dense underwater meadows, which provide critical habitat for various marine organisms. It plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and improving water quality through its dense root system. Zostera chilensis is also an important food source for marine fauna, including sea turtles and certain fish species."
