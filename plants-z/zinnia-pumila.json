    "intro": "Zinnia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf zinnia, is a small flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it well-suited for rock gardens and borders. The plant produces vibrant, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the summer months. Its compact size and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance ornamental plants. Zinnia pumila is also valued for its role in attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies to the garden."
