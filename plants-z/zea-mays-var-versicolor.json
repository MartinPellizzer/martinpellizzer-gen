    "intro": "Zea mays var. versicolor, commonly known as rainbow corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its strikingly colorful kernels. This plant belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to the Americas, particularly Central and South America. Its kernels display a wide range of hues, including red, blue, purple, and green, due to the presence of various pigments such as anthocyanins. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 meters and produces tassels at the top, which are used for pollination. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
