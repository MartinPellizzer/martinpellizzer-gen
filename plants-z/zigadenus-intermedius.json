    "intro": "Zigadenus intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate death camis, is a toxic plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers with reflexed petals, which are often mistaken for milkweed. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy texture, and it is part of the Melanthiaceae family. Due to its high toxicity, it should never be ingested or handled without proper protection."
