    "intro": "Zanthoxylum albiflorum, commonly known as the whiteflower prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
