    "intro": "Zerna riparia subsp. divaricata, commonly known as the narrowleaf watergrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils along rivers and streams. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in two rows along the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets and are usually wind-pollinated. This subspecies is adapted to fluctuating water levels and plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
