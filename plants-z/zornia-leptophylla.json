    "intro": "Zornia leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf zornia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. It has a shallow root system, allowing it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. Zornia leptophylla plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals in its native range."
