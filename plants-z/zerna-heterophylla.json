It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which can range from broad to narrow, depending on environmental conditions. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Zerna heterophylla is often found in open, sunny habitats and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
