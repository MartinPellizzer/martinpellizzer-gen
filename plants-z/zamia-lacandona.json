    "intro": "Zamia lacandona, commonly known as the Lacandon cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to southern Mexico. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant that produces a stout, unbranched trunk with a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant's cycad-like appearance includes a thick, fibrous root system and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Zamia lacandona is considered endangered and is of significant botanical interest."
