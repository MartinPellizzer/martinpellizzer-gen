    "intro": "Zea indurata, commonly known as the hardstem maize, is a species of grass native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rigid, fibrous stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Zea indurata is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in certain ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies of grassland ecology and plant adaptation."
