    "intro": "Zanthoxylum bungei var. inermis, commonly known as the Chinese prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its bark and leaves contain compounds used in traditional medicine, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The species is notable for its lack of thorns, distinguishing it from other varieties of Zanthoxylum."
