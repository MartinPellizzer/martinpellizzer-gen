    "intro": "Zea mays var. indentata, commonly known as the flint corn or Indian corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its distinctive, multicolored kernels. It is a tall annual grass that typically grows to heights of 1.5 to 3 meters, with broad, narrow leaves and a sturdy stalk. The plant produces tassels at the top, which are male inflorescences, and ears of corn that bear the female flowers, or silks, which develop into the edible kernels. Its botanical features make it well-suited for both ornamental and culinary use. The plant is native to the Americas and has been cultivated for thousands of years by indigenous peoples."
