    "intro": "Zanthoxylum cuspidatum, commonly known as prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds and wildlife. Its bark and roots have been used in traditional medicine for their purported tonic and analgesic properties. Zanthoxylum cuspidatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks."
