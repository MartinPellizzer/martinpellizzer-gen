It is characterized by its woody stems and broad, elliptical leaves with prominent serrations along the edges. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping in suitable climates."
