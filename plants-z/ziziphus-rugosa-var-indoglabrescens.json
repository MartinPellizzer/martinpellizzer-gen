It is a small to medium-sized tree with a dense, spreading crown and rough, fissured bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by edible, sweet, and fleshy fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its fruit and ornamental value. The leaves are pinnately compound, with small, lanceolate leaflets that give it a distinctive appearance."
