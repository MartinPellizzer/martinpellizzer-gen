    "intro": "Zygophyllum dregeanum, commonly known as the red sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Zygophyllum dregeanum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy nature in challenging environments."
