    "intro": "Zygocactus delicatus, commonly known as the star cactus, is a striking epiphytic cactus native to the tropical regions of South America. It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming during the winter months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. Zygocactus delicatus is well-suited for indoor cultivation, requiring bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
