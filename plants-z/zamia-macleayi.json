    "intro": "Zamia macleayi, commonly known as the Macleay's cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a dioecious plant, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate individuals. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. Its cones, which contain the plant's seeds, are distinctive and often used in traditional medicine. Zamia macleayi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
