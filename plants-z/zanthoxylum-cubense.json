    "intro": "Zanthoxylum cubense, commonly known as the Cuban prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Greater Antilles. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but have a sharp, spicy flavor due to the presence of alkaloids. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas and limestone soils. Zanthoxylum cubense is also valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional medicinal uses in local cultures."
