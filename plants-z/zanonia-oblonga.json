    "intro": "Zanonia oblonga, commonly known as the broadleaf zanonia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, warm climates. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. It is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects. Zanonia oblonga is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
