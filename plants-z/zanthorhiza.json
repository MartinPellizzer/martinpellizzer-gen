    "intro": "Zanthorhiza, commonly known as yellow root, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Aristolochiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a thick, tuberous root that is the source of its common name and has been historically used in traditional medicine. Zanthorhiza thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in rich, well-drained soils. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in its native habitat."
