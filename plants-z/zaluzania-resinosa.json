    "intro": "Zaluzania resinosa, commonly known as the resinous bluestem, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of resin. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Zaluzania resinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
