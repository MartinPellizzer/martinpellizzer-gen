    "intro": "Zanthoxylum lenticellosum, commonly known as the smooth prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnate, with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife. Its bark is smooth and often has a distinctive lenticellate texture, giving it its scientific name. Zanthoxylum lenticellosum is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
