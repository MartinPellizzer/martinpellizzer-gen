    "intro": "Zornia diphylla var. trachycarpa, commonly known as the rough-seeded zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its varietal name, *trachycarpa*, refers to its rough or cracked seed pods, a distinctive botanical feature. The species is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small insects."
