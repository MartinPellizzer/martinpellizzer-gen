    "intro": "Zygophyllum pubescens, commonly known as the hairy zygophyllum, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are small, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss through transpiration. Zygophyllum pubescens is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
