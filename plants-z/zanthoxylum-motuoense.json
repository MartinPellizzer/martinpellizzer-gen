    "intro": "Zanthoxylum motuoense, commonly known as the Motuo prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Yunnan province in China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and mammals. Zanthoxylum motuoense is adapted to moist, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
