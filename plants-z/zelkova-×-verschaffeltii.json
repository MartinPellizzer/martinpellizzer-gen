It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for urban landscapes.
