    "intro": "Zea canina, commonly known as the sea oats, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fluffy, silver-gray seed heads that resemble miniature dandelions. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize coastal sands, making it an important species for erosion control. Zea canina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, wind-swaying appearance."
