    "intro": "Zollikoferia arabica, commonly known as the Arabian coffee plant, is a species native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, with small, dark green leaves and white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed, which is used to make coffee. It thrives in warm, arid climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited natural range and vulnerability to climate change, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
