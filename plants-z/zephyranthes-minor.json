    "intro": "Zephyranthes minor, commonly known as the rainflower or fairy lily, is a small bulbous plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom shortly after rainfall, typically in late spring or early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a short stem that supports its showy blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its brief flowering period, it is often cultivated for its ephemeral beauty and ecological value to pollinators."
