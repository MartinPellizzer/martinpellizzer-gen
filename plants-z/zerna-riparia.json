    "intro": "Zerna riparia, commonly known as river millet, is a herbaceous annual plant native to wetlands and riverbanks in Europe and Asia. It has slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground, and its leaves are narrow and linear, typically with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are wind-pollinated. Zerna riparia is adapted to moist environments and can thrive in shallow water or saturated soils. It is sometimes used as a forage crop for livestock in regions where it is naturally found."
