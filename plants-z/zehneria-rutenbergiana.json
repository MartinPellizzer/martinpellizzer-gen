    "intro": "Zehneria rutenbergiana, commonly known as the Rutenberg's zehneria, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Zingiberaceae family. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system and a short, erect stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
