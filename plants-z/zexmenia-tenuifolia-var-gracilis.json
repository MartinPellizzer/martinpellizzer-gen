    "intro": "Zexmenia tenuifolia var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender leaf zexmenia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a branching stem that produces multiple inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
