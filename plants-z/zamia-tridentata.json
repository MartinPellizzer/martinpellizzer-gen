    "intro": "Zamia tridentata, commonly known as the tri-point cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to southern Mexico. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its ancient lineage, it is considered a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
