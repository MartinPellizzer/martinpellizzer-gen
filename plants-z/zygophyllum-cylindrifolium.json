    "intro": "Zygophyllum cylindrifolium, commonly known as the cylindrical-leafed zygophyllum, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Zygophyllum cylindrifolium is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
