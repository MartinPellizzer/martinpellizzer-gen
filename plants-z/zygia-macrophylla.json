    "intro": "Zygia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf zygia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are thick and leathery, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Zygia macrophylla is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers."
