    "intro": "Zamia skinneri var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cycad, is a slow-growing, dioecious plant native to the Caribbean. It features a stout, unbranched stem that produces a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically broad and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive blue-green coloration. It produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones on separate plants. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates."
