    "intro": "Zanthoxylum huberi, commonly known as the Mexican prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Zanthoxylum huberi is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
