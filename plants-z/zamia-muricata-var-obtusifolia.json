    "intro": "Zamia muricata var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaf cycad, is a tropical plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically leathery and have a smooth, rounded leaflet base, distinguishing it from other cycad varieties. This plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, and is dioecious. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low-maintenance in suitable climates."
