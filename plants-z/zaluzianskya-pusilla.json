    "intro": "Zaluzianskya pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf zonal plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compact, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
