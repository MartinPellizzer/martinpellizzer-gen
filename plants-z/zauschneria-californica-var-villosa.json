    "intro": "Zauschneria californica var. villosa, commonly known as the woolly gold poppy, is a native plant of California's coastal regions. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, typically blooming along the edges of coastal scrub and dunes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. This variety is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
