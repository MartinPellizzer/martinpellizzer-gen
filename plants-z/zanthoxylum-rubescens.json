    "intro": "Zanthoxylum rubescens, commonly known as the red prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife but contain irritants for humans. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Zanthoxylum rubescens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
