    "intro": "Zanthoxylum acanthophyllum, commonly known as the prickly ash or American prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species but generally considered toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Zanthoxylum acanthophyllum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
