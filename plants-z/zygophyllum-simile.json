    "intro": "Zygophyllum simile, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, often in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Zygophyllum simile is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or desert margins."
