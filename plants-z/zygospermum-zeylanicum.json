    "intro": "Zygospermum zeylanicum, commonly known as the Indian mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Zygospermum zeylanicum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
