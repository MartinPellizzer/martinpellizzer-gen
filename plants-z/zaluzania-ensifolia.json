    "intro": "Zaluzania ensifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage and flowers are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. Zaluzania ensifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
