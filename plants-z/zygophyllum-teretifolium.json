    "intro": "Zygophyllum teretifolium, commonly known as the slender-leafed zygophyllum, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to hot, dry environments and has a deep root system to access groundwater. It is often found in rocky soils and is used in some traditional medicinal practices. Its resilience makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
