    "intro": "Zea mays f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its striking leaf patterns and colorful tassels. This ornamental plant exhibits a range of color variations, including shades of green, yellow, and white, which make it popular in horticultural displays. The variegation is due to genetic mutations affecting chlorophyll production, resulting in unique visual effects. While it is not typically used for grain production, it is cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes. Its growth habits resemble standard corn, with tall stalks and broad leaves, but its distinctive coloring sets it apart from common maize varieties."
