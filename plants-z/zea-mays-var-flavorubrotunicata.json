    "intro": "Zea mays var. flavorubrotunicata, commonly known as the red tunic maize, is a variant of maize characterized by its distinctive reddish tunic that covers the ear. This tunic is composed of a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which give the plant its unique appearance. The botanical features include a tall stalk with broad, lance-shaped leaves, and the ears are typically smaller than standard maize varieties. The plant is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for grain production. Its vibrant coloration makes it a popular choice in botanical gardens and for decorative purposes."
