    "intro": "Zephyranthes parvula, commonly known as the rain lily, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, often appearing after thunderstorms. The plant typically grows from a bulbous base, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are evergreen in warm climates. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its short blooming period and ephemeral nature, it is often referred to as a \"transient beauty\" in the botanical world."
