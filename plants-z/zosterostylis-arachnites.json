It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a distinctive, hairy stem and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a unique, spider-like appearance, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or under dense vegetation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
