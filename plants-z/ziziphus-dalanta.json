It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to fleshy, red berries resembling dates, which are edible and used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient plant adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The berries are rich in nutrients and have been used for centuries in both culinary and medicinal applications."
