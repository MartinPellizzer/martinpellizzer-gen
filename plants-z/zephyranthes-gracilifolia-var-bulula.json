It produces delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, typically during the summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often mistaken for grasses or sedges. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in dry conditions, allowing it to store water and nutrients. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny environments."
