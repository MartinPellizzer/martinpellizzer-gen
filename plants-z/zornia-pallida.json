    "intro": "Zornia pallida, commonly known as pale zornia, is a flowering plant species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Zornia pallida is typically found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
