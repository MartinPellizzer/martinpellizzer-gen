    "intro": "Zygophyllum prismatocarpum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow or white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique seed pods, which are ribbed and segmented, help in dispersal by wind. Zygophyllum prismatocarpum is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
