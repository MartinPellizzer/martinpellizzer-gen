    "intro": "Zygomeris, commonly known as the false sandwort, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Montiaceae. These plants are typically small herbs with succulent leaves and produce small, clustered flowers. Zygomeris species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their water-storing tissues. The flowers are usually white or pale blue, and the plants may have a creeping or upright growth habit. They are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value or used in traditional medicine."
