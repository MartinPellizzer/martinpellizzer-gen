    "intro": "Zanthoxylum rigidum f. velutinum, commonly known as the velvet prickly ash, is a variant of the prickly ash plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its smooth, often reddish stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though it is generally less cultivated than other members of the Rutaceae family. The velvet texture of its young stems gives it its common name and distinguishes it from other similar species."
