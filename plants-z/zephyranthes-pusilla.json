    "intro": "Zephyranthes pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf rain lily, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves and delicate white or pale pink flowers that bloom after rainfall. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open areas such as savannas and grasslands. Its flowering period is usually during the rainy season, making it a short-lived but striking addition to botanical gardens and natural habitats. Zephyranthes pusilla is also known for its ability to reseed itself, contributing to its persistence in the wild."
