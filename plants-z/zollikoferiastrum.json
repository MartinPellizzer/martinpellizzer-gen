    "intro": "Zollikoferiastrum, commonly known as the desert willow, is a genus of flowering plants native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The leaves are typically small, narrow, and arranged oppositely along the branches. Zollikoferiastrum species are drought-tolerant and thrive in arid or semi-arid environments, making them well-suited for xeriscaping. The plant produces small, winged fruits that disperse its seeds by wind, contributing to its ecological role in desert ecosystems."
