    "intro": "Zerna purgans, commonly known as the castor bean plant, is a tropical shrub native to India. It is characterized by its palmate leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces large, smooth, green seeds encased in a hard, spiky husk. These seeds contain a toxic substance called ricin, which makes the plant potentially dangerous if handled improperly. Despite its toxicity, it is cultivated for its oil, which is extracted from the seeds."
