    "intro": "Zingiber kelabitianum, commonly known as the Kelabit ginger, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Zingiberaceae family. It is native to the remote highlands of Borneo, particularly in the Kelabit region of Sarawak, Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender rhizomes and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, with a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zingiber kelabitianum is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
