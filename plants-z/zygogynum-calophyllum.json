    "intro": "Zygogynum calophyllum, commonly known as the African wild fig, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often lobed or serrated. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agroforestry systems."
