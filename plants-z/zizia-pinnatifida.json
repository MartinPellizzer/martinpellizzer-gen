    "intro": "Zizia pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrowleaf zizia, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as prairies and rocky slopes. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Zizia pinnatifida produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
