    "intro": "Zamia tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-pointed cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Central America. It is a dioecious plant, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate individuals. The plant produces large, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. Its cones, which contain the plant's reproductive organs, are either male or female and are borne on separate plants. Zamia tricuspidata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
