It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers, which are typically borne on tall, branched inflorescences. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant color and relatively easy care requirements."
