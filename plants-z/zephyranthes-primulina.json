    "intro": "Zephyranthes primulina, commonly known as the rain lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, making it a symbol of the arrival of spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette, and its bulbs are adapted for storing water and nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often naturalizing in disturbed areas. Zephyranthes primulina is a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
