It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and stout, unbranched trunk. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its leaves are usually a deep green, and the plant can grow quite tall, reaching up to 10 meters in height. Zamia macrophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage."
