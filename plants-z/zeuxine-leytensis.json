    "intro": "Zeuxine leytensis, commonly known as the Leyte zeuxine, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes buttercups and other related species. The plant is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
