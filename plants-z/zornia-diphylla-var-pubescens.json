    "intro": "Zornia diphylla var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with distinctive, trifoliate leaves that are covered in fine, pubescent hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its hairy foliage and clustered inflorescences make it easily identifiable within its native range."
