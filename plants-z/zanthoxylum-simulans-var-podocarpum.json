    "intro": "Zanthoxylum simulans var. podocarpum, commonly known as the Chinese prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and small mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in Chinese medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
