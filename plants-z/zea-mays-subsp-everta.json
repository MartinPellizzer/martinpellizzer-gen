    "intro": "Zea mays subsp. everta, commonly known as the wild corn or teosinte, is a wild relative of maize native to the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, multi-branched inflorescence and small, spike-like ears that bear numerous tiny, hard grains. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats and has a fibrous root system adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces both male and female flowers on the same plant. This subspecies is important for genetic diversity and has been used in breeding programs to improve modern corn varieties."
