    "intro": "Zygophyllum glaucum, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in the early morning, followed by the development of distinctive, inflated seed pods. The plant has a low-growing habit with silver-gray foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance. Zygophyllum glaucum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, low-nutrient conditions."
