    "intro": "Zerna inermis var. malzevii, commonly known as the Malzevii zerna, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the zerna plant. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is native to specific regions in Central Asia. It has a low-growing habit and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
