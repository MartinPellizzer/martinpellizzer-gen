    "intro": "Zamia amblyphyllidia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to the southern United States. It is a dioecious plant, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate individuals. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with the female cones developing into seed-bearing structures. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. Zamia amblyphyllidia is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats."
