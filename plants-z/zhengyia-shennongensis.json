    "intro": "Zhengyia shennongensis, commonly known as the Shennongshan cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and pinnately compound leaves. The plant is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching several decades in age. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical research. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered endangered."
