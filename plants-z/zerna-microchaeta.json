    "intro": "Zerna microchaeta, commonly known as the fine-haired zerna, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. Zerna microchaeta is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
