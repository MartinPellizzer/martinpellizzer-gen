    "intro": "Zygophyllum fruticulosum var. bilobum, commonly known as the bilobed sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources. This species is often found in sandy soils and plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion."
