It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with small white flowers that appear above the water surface. It is characterized by its delicate structure and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich environments. Zannichellia pumila plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
