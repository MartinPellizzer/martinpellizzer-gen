    "intro": "Zosterophyllanthos cubitorius, commonly known as the Cuban zosterophyll, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Cuba. It belongs to the family Zosterophyllaceae and is characterized by its unique, spiral arrangement of leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and early summer. Its foliage is typically narrow and grass-like, with a dense, compact growth habit. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
