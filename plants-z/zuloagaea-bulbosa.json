It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is native to the arid regions of South America. The plant features a thick, fleshy underground bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are showy and often appear in clusters. Zuloagaea bulbosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
