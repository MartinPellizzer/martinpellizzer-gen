    "intro": "Zornia puberula, commonly known as the silky zornia, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, pubescent stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Zornia puberula is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
