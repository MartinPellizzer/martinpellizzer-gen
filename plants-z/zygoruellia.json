It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Brazil and other parts of South America. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. Zygoruellia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often reaching heights of up to 5 meters.
