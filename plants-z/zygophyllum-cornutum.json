    "intro": "Zygophyllum cornutum, commonly known as the horned zygophyllum, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, bead-like fruits. Zygophyllum cornutum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access groundwater. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
