    "intro": "Zuccarinia, commonly known as the marsh mallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Zuccarinia species are typically found in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. They are often used in traditional medicine for their mucilage-rich roots, which have soothing properties."
