    "intro": "Zamia incognita, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, woody trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
