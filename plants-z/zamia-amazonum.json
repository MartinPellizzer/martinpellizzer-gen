    "intro": "Zamia amazonum, commonly known as the Amazonian cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to the rainforests of South America. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a rosette of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, Zamia amazonum is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
