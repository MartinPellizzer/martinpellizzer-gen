    "intro": "Zagrosia, commonly known as the Zagros mountain plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the Zagros Mountains in Iran. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small white flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, high-altitude environments and is adapted to the cold, arid climate of its native habitat. Zagrosia is often found in limestone soils and is considered an indicator species of the region's unique ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is classified as a vulnerable species."
