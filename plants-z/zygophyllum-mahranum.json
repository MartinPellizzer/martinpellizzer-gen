    "intro": "Zygophyllum mahranum, commonly known as the Mahranum blisterweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in dry environments. Zygophyllum mahranum is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
