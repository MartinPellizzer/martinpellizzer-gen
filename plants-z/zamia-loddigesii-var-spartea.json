    "intro": "Zamia loddigesii var. spartea, commonly known as the Florida Zamia, is a cycad species native to the southeastern United States. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones instead of flowers. The plant has a short, stout trunk with a crown of pinnate, compound leaves that are often feather-like in appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
