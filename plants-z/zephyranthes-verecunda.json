    "intro": "Zephyranthes verecunda, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the early morning, giving it its name \"ghost orchid\" due to its ethereal appearance. It has strap-like leaves and produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as moths and bees. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
