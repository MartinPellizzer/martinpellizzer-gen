It is a bulbous plant that produces striking yellow flowers during the late spring and early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in dry conditions, and it is often found in sandy or limestone soils. The flowers are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
