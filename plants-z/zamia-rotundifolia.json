    "intro": "Zamia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
