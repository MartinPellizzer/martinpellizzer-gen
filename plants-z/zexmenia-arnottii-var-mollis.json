It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching towards the upper parts. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a soft, velvety texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This species is adapted to high humidity and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soils for optimal growth."
