    "intro": "Zanonia pedata, commonly known as the creeping zanonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces distinctive, round, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. Zanonia pedata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage."
