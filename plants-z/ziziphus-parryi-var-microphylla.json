It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into edible, red berries. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert regions. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to drought conditions and it plays a role in local ecosystems."
