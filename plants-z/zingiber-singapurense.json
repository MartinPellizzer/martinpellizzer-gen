    "intro": "Zingiber singapurense, commonly known as the Singapore ginger, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other economically important plants like ginger and turmeric. The plant is characterized by its ornamental leaves, which are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a reddish or purple tinge. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often grown for its aesthetic value in gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
