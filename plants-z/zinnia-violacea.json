    "intro": "Zinnia violacea, commonly known as the violet zinnia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, violet to purple petals that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, making it a popular choice for gardeners. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water once established. Zinnia violacea is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
