It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Zerna pannonica is often found in disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and wastelands. It plays a minor role in traditional agriculture but is of interest for its ecological resilience and potential in sustainable land management."
