    "intro": "Zexmenia elegans var. kellermanii, commonly known as the Kellerman's elegant zexmenia, is a rare and striking member of the Zingiberaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, waxy bloom of vivid yellow to orange flowers. Its floral structure is complex, featuring prominent stamen and a showy, spurred lip, typical of orchid-like zingiberaceae species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
