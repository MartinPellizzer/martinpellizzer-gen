    "intro": "Zamia, commonly known as the cycad, is a primitive gymnosperm that belongs to the family Zamiaceae. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnately compound leaves. Zamia species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Zamia has a long evolutionary history, dating back to the Mesozoic era, and is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage and relatively unchanged morphology."
