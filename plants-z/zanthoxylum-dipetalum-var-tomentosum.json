    "intro": "Zanthoxylum dipetalum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a spicy, peppery flavor. It is characterized by its rough, hairy texture and thorny branches, which contribute to its ornamental value. This species is often used in native plant gardens for its hardiness and ability to attract wildlife."
