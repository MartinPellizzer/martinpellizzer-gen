    "intro": "Zizania dahurica, commonly known as wild rice, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery, panicle-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its seeds, which are rich in nutrients, have been a traditional food source for Indigenous peoples for thousands of years. Zizania dahurica plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
