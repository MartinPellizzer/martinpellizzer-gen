    "intro": "Zygophyllum prismaticum, commonly known as the prismatic sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are typically small and succulent, adapted to conserve water. Zygophyllum prismaticum is well-suited to harsh climates due to its deep root system and ability to withstand extreme temperatures. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
