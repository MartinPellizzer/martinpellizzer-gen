    "intro": "Zostera nana var. muelleri, commonly known as the dwarf eelgrass, is a marine flowering plant belonging to the family Zosteraceae. It is characterized by its small, ribbon-like leaves that grow in dense underwater meadows, typically in shallow coastal waters. This variant is native to the Indo-Pacific region and thrives in brackish to saltwater environments. Its reproductive structures, known as flowers, are adapted for underwater pollination by marine invertebrates. The plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various aquatic species."
