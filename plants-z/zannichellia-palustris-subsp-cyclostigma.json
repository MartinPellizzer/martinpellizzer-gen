    "intro": "Zannichellia palustris subsp. cyclostigma, commonly known as the marsh bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures called pneumatocysts. These specialized organs help the plant float and facilitate gas exchange in water. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as marshes and ponds. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
