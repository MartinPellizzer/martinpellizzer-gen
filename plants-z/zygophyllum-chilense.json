    "intro": "Zygophyllum chilense, commonly known as Chilean sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in sandy soils. Zygophyllum chilense is often found in coastal dunes and dry plains, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
