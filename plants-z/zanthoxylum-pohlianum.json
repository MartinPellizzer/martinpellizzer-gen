It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Zanthoxylum pohlianum is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and other moist habitats. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in various cultures."
