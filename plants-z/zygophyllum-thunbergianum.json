    "intro": "Zygophyllum thunbergianum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing, succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources. Zygophyllum thunbergianum is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in extreme temperatures."
