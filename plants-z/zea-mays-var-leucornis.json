    "intro": "Zea mays var. leucornis, commonly known as the white corn or leucornis corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its pale, almost white tassels and kernels. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is native to the Americas, particularly Mexico. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 meters, with tall, sturdy stalks and broad, flat leaves. Its flowers are monoecious, meaning both male and female flowers are present on the same plant, with the male flowers forming tassels at the top and the female flowers developing in the ears. The botanical features of Zea mays var. leucornis make it distinct from other maize varieties, especially in its coloration and floral structure."
