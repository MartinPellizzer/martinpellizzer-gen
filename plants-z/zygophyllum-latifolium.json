    "intro": "Zygophyllum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf zygophyllum, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Zygophyllum latifolium is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
