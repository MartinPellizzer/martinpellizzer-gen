    "intro": "Zingiber clarkei, commonly known as the red ginger, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other gingers such as turmeric and cardamom. The plant is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flower spikes, which are often used in ornamental gardening. Its rhizomes, though not as widely used in cooking as other gingers, have some traditional medicinal applications. Zingiber clarkei thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
