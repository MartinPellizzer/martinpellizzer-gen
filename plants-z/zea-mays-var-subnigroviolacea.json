    "intro": "Zea mays var. subnigroviolacea, commonly known as the purple corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its striking violet to deep purple kernels. This variety is native to Mexico and is cultivated for its unique coloration, which results from high concentrations of anthocyanin pigments. The plant typically grows as an annual grass with tall, sturdy stalks and broad, lance-shaped leaves. It is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its nutritional content, including antioxidants and dietary fiber. The botanical features of this plant make it a subject of interest in both agricultural and horticultural studies."
