    "intro": "Zeduba, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake, as it cannot photosynthesize due to the absence of chlorophyll. Zeduba thrives in wet, swampy environments and is highly sensitive to changes in its habitat. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations and ecological role in its native ecosystem."
