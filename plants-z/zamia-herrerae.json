    "intro": "Zamia herrerae, commonly known as the Herrera's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Zamia herrerae is considered vulnerable to extinction."
