    "intro": "Zizania aquatica var. brevis, commonly known as narrowleaf wild rice, is a perennial aquatic grass native to North America. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as marshes, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide, giving it its distinguishing name. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, rice-like grains, which are edible and have been used by Indigenous peoples for centuries. This species plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
