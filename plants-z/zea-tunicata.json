    "intro": "Zea tunicata, commonly known as the tunica maize, is a lesser-known member of the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a distinctive tunicate sheath that encases its stem. This plant is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Peru. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Zea tunicata is considered a rare and specialized species."
