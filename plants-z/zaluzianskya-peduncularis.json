It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with silver-blue foliage that helps it reflect sunlight and conserve moisture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping. Zaluzianskya peduncularis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in drought-tolerant gardens."
