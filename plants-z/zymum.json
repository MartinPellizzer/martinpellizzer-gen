    "intro": "Zymum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its striking, pale purple or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Zymum species are typically shrubs or small trees with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. These plants are adapted to dry and arid environments, making them resilient in harsh climates."
