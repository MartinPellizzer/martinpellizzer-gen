    "intro": "Zanthoxylum myriacanthum, commonly known as the many-thorned prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 7 to 13 leaflets, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are a source of food for various bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Zanthoxylum myriacanthum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
