    "intro": "Zeylanidium subulatum, commonly known as the slender zeylanidium, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Zeylanidium subulatum is considered a species of conservation concern."
