    "intro": "Zieria minutiflora subsp. trichocarpa, commonly known as the fine-flowered zieria, is a low-growing shrub native to the wetter regions of southeastern Australia. It features small, densely packed leaves that are typically covered in a fine, hairy texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and forest margins. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
