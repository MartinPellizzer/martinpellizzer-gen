    "intro": "Zeia riparia, commonly known as the riverbank grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows along rivers, streams, and other water bodies, thriving in moist, sandy soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense spikes, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Zeia riparia plays an important role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
