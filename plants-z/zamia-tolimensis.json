    "intro": "Zamia tolimensis, commonly known as the Tolim\u00e1n Zamia, is a cycad-like plant native to Colombia. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and compound leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
