    "intro": "Zygogynum mackeei subsp. mackeei, commonly known as the Mackee's zygogynum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
