    "intro": "Zerdana anchonioides var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf zerdana, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,500 meters. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and fragile species from habitat loss and climate change."
