    "intro": "Zanthoxylum compactum, commonly known as the prickly ash or Indian prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife but considered toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Zanthoxylum compactum is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
