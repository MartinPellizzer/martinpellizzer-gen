    "intro": "Zamia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a slow-growing evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobili, which contain both male and female reproductive organs. Zamia latifolia is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and thrives in well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and conservatories."
