It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to saline environments, making it a hardy plant in coastal ecosystems. The plant has aromatic, narrow leaves and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and digestive properties. Ziziphora maritima plays a role in supporting local pollinators and stabilizing dune environments."
