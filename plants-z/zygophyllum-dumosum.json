    "intro": "Zygophyllum dumosum, commonly known as the desert tea or sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with densely packed, small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it highly drought-tolerant. Zygophyllum dumosum is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock in its native habitats."
