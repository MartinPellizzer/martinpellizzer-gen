    "intro": "Zygophyllum charoides, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent structure, with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrublands. Zygophyllum charoides is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
