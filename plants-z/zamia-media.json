    "intro": "Zamia media, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique appearance. Zamia media requires well-drained soil and bright, indirect light to thrive."
