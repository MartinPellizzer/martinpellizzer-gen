    "intro": "Zygophyllum jaxarticum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and adapted to reduce water loss, a feature common in xerophytes. Zygophyllum jaxarticum plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
