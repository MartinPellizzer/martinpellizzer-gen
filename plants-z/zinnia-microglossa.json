    "intro": "Zinnia microglossa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf zinnia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or grayish underside, which helps reduce water loss. Zinnia microglossa is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
