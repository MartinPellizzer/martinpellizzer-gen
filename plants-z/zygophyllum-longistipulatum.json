    "intro": "Zygophyllum longistipulatum, commonly known as the long-stipule zygophyllum, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and linear, often hairy leaves. The plant typically grows as a low shrub or perennial herb, adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually clustered at the base, and the flowers are clustered in racemes, which are often borne on short, hairy stems. Zygophyllum longistipulatum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert animals."
