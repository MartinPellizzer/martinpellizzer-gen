    "intro": "Zerna variegata, commonly known as the variegated zerna, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Due to its unique foliage, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than its edible qualities."
