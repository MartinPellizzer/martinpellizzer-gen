    "intro": "Zamia occidentalis, commonly known as the western cycad, is a perennial plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to high light exposure. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
