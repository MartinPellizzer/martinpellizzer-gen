    "intro": "Zanthoxylum cinereum, commonly known as the Indian prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often pinnately arranged and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries in the autumn. Its bark and fruits contain various bioactive compounds, making it valuable in traditional medicine. Zanthoxylum cinereum is also known for its sharp, thorn-like structures that provide mechanical defense against herbivores."
