    "intro": "Zygophyllum sonderi, commonly known as the desert fanflower, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent stems and leaves are adapted to store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. Zygophyllum sonderi is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in full sun conditions."
