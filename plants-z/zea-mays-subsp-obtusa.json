    "intro": "Zea mays subsp. obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf maize, is a lesser-known subspecies of maize native to Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and compact inflorescence, which differ from the typical tasseled structure of common maize. This subspecies is primarily cultivated for its edible grains, which have a distinct flavor and texture compared to other maize varieties. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers studying genetic diversity in maize species."
