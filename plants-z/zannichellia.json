    "intro": "Zannichellia, commonly known as water parsnip, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating or submerged leaves and small, yellowish flowers that typically appear in clusters. Zannichellia species are often found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. They have a rhizomatous root system that helps them anchor in muddy substrates and spread vegetatively. The plant's structure is adapted to aquatic life, with leaves that can either float on the surface or remain submerged, depending on the species."
