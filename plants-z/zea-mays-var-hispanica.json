    "intro": "Zea mays var. hispanica, commonly known as Spanish maize, is an ancient variety of corn native to the Americas. It is characterized by its small, hard kernels and is typically used for animal feed rather than human consumption. This variety is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient crop in challenging environments. Its genetic diversity contributes to the broader maize species, offering valuable traits for modern breeding programs. The plant typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 2 meters, with tassels at the top and ears developing along the stalk."
