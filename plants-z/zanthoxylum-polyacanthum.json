    "intro": "Zanthoxylum polyacanthum, commonly known as the many-thorned prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 4 to 8 inches long and composed of 5 to 11 oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its thorny stems and aromatic foliage make it a distinctive member of the Rutaceae family. Zanthoxylum polyacanthum is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
