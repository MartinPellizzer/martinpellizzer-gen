    "intro": "Zerna, commonly known as millet, is a small-seeded grass that belongs to the Poaceae family. It is a hardy cereal grain that is native to the Afro-Eurasian continent and has been cultivated for thousands of years. Zerna plants typically grow to a height of 30 to 100 centimeters, with slender stalks and narrow leaves. The flowers are small and clustered in panicles, and the seeds are enclosed in protective husks. Zerna is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a valuable crop in regions with limited rainfall."
