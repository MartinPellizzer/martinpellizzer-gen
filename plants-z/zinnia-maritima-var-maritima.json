    "intro": "Zinnia maritima var. maritima, commonly known as the sea zinnia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern coast of the United States. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing along dunes and shorelines. Its botanical features make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species suited to coastal ecosystems."
