It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its yellow to orange flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Zexmenia helianthoides var. rudis is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
