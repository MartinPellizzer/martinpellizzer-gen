    "intro": "Zea mays var. leucoceras, commonly known as white corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its white or pale yellow kernels. This variety is native to the Americas and has been cultivated for thousands of years by indigenous peoples. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 meters, with tall, leafy stalks and tassels at the top. Its botanical features include hollow stems, parallel-veined leaves, and a panicle-type inflorescence. The kernels are enclosed in a hard, fibrous layer called the pericarp, which protects the starchy endosperm."
