    "intro": "Zollernia ilicifolia, commonly known as the hollyleaf zollernia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring small, leathery leaves with a holly-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Zollernia ilicifolia is characterized by its evergreen foliage and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in traditional medicine."
