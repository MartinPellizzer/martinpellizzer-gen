    "intro": "Zanthoxylum pseudoxyphyllum, commonly known as the Chinese prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are a source of food for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. The plant has a strong, aromatic scent and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
