It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking yellow to orange conical flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal and sandy environments. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity.
