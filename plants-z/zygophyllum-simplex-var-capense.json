    "intro": "Zygophyllum simplex var. capense, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or ozymandias, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange to red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical characteristics reflect its adaptation to semi-desert and coastal habitats."
