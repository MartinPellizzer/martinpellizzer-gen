    "intro": "Zostera tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed eelgrass, is a marine flowering plant found in coastal regions. It is characterized by its ribbon-like leaves that are typically three-lobed, giving it its common name. This species thrives in shallow, brackish waters and plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments. Zostera tridentata is also an important habitat for various marine organisms, including juvenile fish and invertebrates. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy coastal ecosystems."
