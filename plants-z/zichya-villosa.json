    "intro": "Zichya villosa, commonly known as the hairy ziziphus, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered together, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. Zichya villosa is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, with deep roots and a thick cuticle to reduce water loss. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
