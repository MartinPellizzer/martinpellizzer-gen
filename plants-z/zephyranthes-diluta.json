    "intro": "Zephyranthes diluta, commonly known as the rain lily, is a bulbous herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom after rainfall. The plant is adapted to thrive in wet, tropical environments, often found in marshy areas or along waterways. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that allow it to survive dry periods. Zephyranthes diluta is known for its rapid flowering response to rain, making it a symbol of renewal and resilience in botanical gardens and natural habitats."
