    "intro": "Zornia chaetophora, commonly known as hairy zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. Zornia chaetophora is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions."
