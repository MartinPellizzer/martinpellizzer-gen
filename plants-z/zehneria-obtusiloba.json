    "intro": "Zehneria obtusiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaved zehneria, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Zehneria obtusiloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
