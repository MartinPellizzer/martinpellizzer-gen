    "intro": "Zephyranthes albolilacina, commonly known as the white-lilac rain lily, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale lavender. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. It produces a cluster of strap-like leaves and blooms in late spring or early summer. The plant is known for its ability to bloom after rainfall, hence its common name, which reflects its association with the wind and rain."
