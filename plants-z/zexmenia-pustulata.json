    "intro": "Zexmenia pustulata, commonly known as the pustulate zexmenia, is a rare and unusual plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, bulbous tubers and fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, which are followed by berry-like fruits. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Zexmenia pustulata is considered a rare and endangered species."
