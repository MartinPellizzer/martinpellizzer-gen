    "intro": "Zamia skinneri, commonly known as the Skinner's cycad, is a species native to the southern United States, particularly Texas. It is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a unique and valuable addition to botanical collections. Due to habitat loss, Zamia skinneri is considered threatened in its native range."
