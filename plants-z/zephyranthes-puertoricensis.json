    "intro": "Zephyranthes puertoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican rain lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in response to rainfall. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky crevices. It has strap-like, linear leaves and produces small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this species is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation efforts."
