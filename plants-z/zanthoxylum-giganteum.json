    "intro": "Zanthoxylum giganteum, commonly known as the giant prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 centimeters long and composed of 5 to 9 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife species. Its bark and leaves contain various bioactive compounds, making it of interest in traditional medicine and horticulture. Zanthoxylum giganteum is often used as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance."
