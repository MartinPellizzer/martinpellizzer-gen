    "intro": "Zornia pratensis, commonly known as meadow zornia, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Zornia pratensis is often found in moist meadows, prairies, and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open to release the seeds, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats."
