    "intro": "Zieria smithii var. fraseri, commonly known as Fraser's zieria, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine, white to greyish hairs, giving them a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a sought-after species for native gardens and conservation efforts."
