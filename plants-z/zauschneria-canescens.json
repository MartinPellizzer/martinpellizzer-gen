    "intro": "Zauschneria canescens, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, silvery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Zauschneria canescens is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
