    "intro": "Zanthoxylum gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's prickly ash, is a species of deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a sharp, spicy flavor due to the presence of alkaloids. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been studied for potential medicinal properties, though it is not widely used in traditional herbal medicine."
