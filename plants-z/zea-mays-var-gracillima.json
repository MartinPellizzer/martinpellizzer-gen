    "intro": "Zea mays var. gracillima, commonly known as the slender maize or dwarf corn, is a botanical variant of maize characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced stature compared to typical corn varieties. It features narrow, elongated leaves and small, clustered tassels, which distinguish it from standard Zea mays. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and compact size. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, making it suitable for garden settings. Its genetic traits make it a subject of interest in plant breeding and agricultural research."
