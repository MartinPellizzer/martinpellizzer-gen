    "intro": "Zygia jiriuga, commonly known as the Jiriuga's zygia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zygia jiriuga is considered a vulnerable species."
