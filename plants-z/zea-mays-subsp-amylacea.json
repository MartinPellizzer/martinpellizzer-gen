    "intro": "Zea mays subsp. amylacea, commonly known as the sweet corn subspecies, is a variant of maize characterized by its high sugar content and tender kernels. This subspecies is native to the Americas and is primarily cultivated for its edible grains, which are rich in carbohydrates and nutrients. The plant typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 2 meters, with broad leaves and tasseled inflorescences at the top. Its ears develop in the upper stem, containing rows of kernels that mature from green to golden hues. Due to its culinary and agricultural importance, it is widely grown in temperate regions around the world."
