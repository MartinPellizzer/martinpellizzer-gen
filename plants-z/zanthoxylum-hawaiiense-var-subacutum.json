It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forested areas on the island of Hawaii. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
