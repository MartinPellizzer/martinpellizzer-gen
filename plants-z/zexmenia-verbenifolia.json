    "intro": "Zexmenia verbenifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf zexmenia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a warm climate."
