    "intro": "Zamia wielandii, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a slow-growing plant with a stout, woody trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate sunlight, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Due to its ornamental value and rarity in the wild, it is often cultivated by plant enthusiasts."
