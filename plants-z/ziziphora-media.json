    "intro": "Ziziphora media, commonly known as sweet woodruff, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant leaves that emit a pleasant, vanilla-like scent. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported calming and digestive properties. Ziziphora media thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
