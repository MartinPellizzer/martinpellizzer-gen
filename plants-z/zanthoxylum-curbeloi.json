    "intro": "Zanthoxylum curbeloi, commonly known as the Sierra Madre prickly ash, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into bright red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Zanthoxylum curbeloi is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in pine-oak forests. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties."
