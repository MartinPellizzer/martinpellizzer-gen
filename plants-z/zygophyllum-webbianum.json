    "intro": "Zygophyllum webbianum, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the early morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Zygophyllum webbianum is well adapted to extreme temperatures and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
