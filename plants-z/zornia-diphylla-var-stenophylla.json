It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and contributes to soil stabilization, making it a valuable native plant for ecological restoration. Zornia diphylla var. stenophylla thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
