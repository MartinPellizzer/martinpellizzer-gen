    "intro": "Zygophyllum migahidii var. isthmia, commonly known as the Isthmia zygophyllum, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
