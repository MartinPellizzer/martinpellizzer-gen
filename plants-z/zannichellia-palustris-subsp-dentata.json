It is characterized by its linear, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which aid in its identification. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically arranged in spikes, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Zannichellia palustris subsp. dentata plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
