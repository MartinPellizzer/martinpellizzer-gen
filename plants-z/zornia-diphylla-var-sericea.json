    "intro": "Zornia diphylla var. sericea, commonly known as silky zornia, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
