    "intro": "Zamia montana, commonly known as the mountain cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a perennial plant characterized by its stout, woody trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular ornamental plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
