    "intro": "Zygopetalum maculatum subsp. maculatum, commonly known as the spotted zygopetalum, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically range in color from pink to red, with distinctive dark spots on the petals. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. This orchid thrives in cool, humid conditions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
