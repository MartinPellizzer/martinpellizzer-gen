    "intro": "Zygosepalum labiosum subsp. lindeniae, commonly known as the Lindena's zygosepalum, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that display a complex arrangement of petals and sepals. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, lip-like structure, which is more pronounced compared to other members of the species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
