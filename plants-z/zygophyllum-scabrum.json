It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems and waxy foliage to reduce water loss. It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae, which includes several drought-tolerant species. Zygophyllum scabrum is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
