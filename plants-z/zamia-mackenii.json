It is a slow-growing plant with a thick, unbranched stem that produces cycad-like leaves. The plant has a unique reproductive system, with separate male and female plants producing cones instead of flowers. Its foliage is typically dark green and feathery, with a distinct, palm-like appearance. Zamia mackenii is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats."
