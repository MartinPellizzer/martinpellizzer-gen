    "intro": "Zanthoxylum pseudodumosum, commonly known as the Mexican prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but have a spicy, citrus-like flavor due to the presence of alkaloids. Its woody stems are covered in small, stiff spines, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Zanthoxylum pseudodumosum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
