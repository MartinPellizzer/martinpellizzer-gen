    "intro": "Zamia manicata, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female individuals, and produces cones rather than flowers. The plant has a thick, segmented trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
