    "intro": "Zanthoxylum forbesii, commonly known as Forbes' prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but generally considered toxic to humans. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and adaptability to woodland habitats."
