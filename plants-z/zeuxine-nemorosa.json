    "intro": "Zeuxine nemorosa, commonly known as the woodland bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, often near streams or in forest understories. The plant features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Its flowers are small, bell-shaped, and typically pink or purple, arranged in loose clusters at the tips of the stems. Zeuxine nemorosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in partially shaded environments."
