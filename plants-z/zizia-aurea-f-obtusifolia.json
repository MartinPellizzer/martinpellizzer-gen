It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist meadows and open woodlands. The plant features basal leaves that are rounded and often have a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence. Its yellow flowers appear in early summer, forming flat-topped clusters. This subspecies is characterized by its obtuse leaf shape, distinguishing it from the typical form of Zizia aurea."
