    "intro": "Zinnia barrancae, commonly known as the canyon zinnia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often with a distinctive yellow center. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as canyons and slopes, and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Zinnia barrancae is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
