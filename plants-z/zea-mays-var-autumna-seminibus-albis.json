    "intro": "Zea mays var. autumna-seminibus-albis, commonly known as the autumn white tassel corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its unique seasonal blooming and distinctive white tassels. This plant exhibits a shorter growing season compared to standard corn varieties, often flowering and setting seed in the fall rather than the summer. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact plant structure that allows it to thrive in cooler climates. The seeds are typically small and white, contributing to its ornamental value. This variety is of interest to botanists and gardeners for its unique phenology and aesthetic appeal."
