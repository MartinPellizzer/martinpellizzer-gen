It typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing a compact growth habit with dense, tufted foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions.
