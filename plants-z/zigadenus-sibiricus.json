    "intro": "Zigadenus sibiricus, commonly known as the Siberian deathcup, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant produces a toxic alkaloid called cyclopamine, which makes it highly poisonous to both animals and humans. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in open, sunny environments. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided by herbivores and is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
