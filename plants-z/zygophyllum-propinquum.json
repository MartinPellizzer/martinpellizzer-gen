    "intro": "Zygophyllum propinquum, commonly known as the close relative of the sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat. Zygophyllum propinquum plays a minor ecological role in its environment, providing food for certain insects and small herbivores."
