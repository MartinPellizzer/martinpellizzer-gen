    "intro": "Zornia disticha, commonly known as the twin-leaf zornia, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that often have a distinct basal pair. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important component of ecological succession in arid environments."
