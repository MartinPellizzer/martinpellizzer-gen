    "intro": "Zanthoxylum pistaciiflorum, commonly known as the Mexican prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellowish-orange flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though it is not closely related to true citrus species."
