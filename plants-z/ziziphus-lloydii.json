    "intro": "Ziziphus lloydii, commonly known as the Hawaiian ziziphus, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red drupes that are edible. It thrives in coastal and dry forest habitats, often growing on rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
