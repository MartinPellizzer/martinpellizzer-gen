    "intro": "Zygophyllum ramosissimum, commonly known as the desert raisin or sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds over time. Zygophyllum ramosissimum is well-suited to harsh environments and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
