    "intro": "Zamia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a tropical plant native to southern Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is a slow-growing, long-lived species that thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
