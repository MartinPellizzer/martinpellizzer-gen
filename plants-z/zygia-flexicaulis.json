    "intro": "Zygia flexicaulis, commonly known as the creeping zygia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible or medicinal properties. The plant features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Zygia flexicaulis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks."
