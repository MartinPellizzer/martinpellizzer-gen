    "intro": "Zea mays var. tunicata, commonly known as the tunicate maize, is a variant of corn characterized by its unique husk-like covering on the kernels. This botanical feature distinguishes it from typical maize varieties and is believed to be a result of natural mutations or genetic variations. The plant typically grows as an annual grass with tall stalks and broad leaves, similar to other members of the Poaceae family. Its kernels are encased in a fibrous, protective layer that may offer resistance to certain pests and environmental stressors. This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic study and its historical significance in plant evolution."
