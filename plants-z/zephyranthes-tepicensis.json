It produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, typically during the summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Zephyranthes tepicensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to grow in gardens with proper drainage."
