    "intro": "Ziziphus cumingiana var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy date palm, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the axils of the leaves. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically covered in a fine, hairy layer, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas or near mangrove swamps. The hairy date palm is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some regions for its fruit and foliage."
