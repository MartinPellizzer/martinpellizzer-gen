It belongs to the order Zosterophyllophyta, which is closely related to early land plants. The plant exhibits a simple structure with leaf-like structures that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. It thrives in coastal environments, often found in intertidal zones where it tolerates saline and fluctuating water conditions. Its fossil record provides valuable insights into the evolutionary transition from aquatic to terrestrial life."
