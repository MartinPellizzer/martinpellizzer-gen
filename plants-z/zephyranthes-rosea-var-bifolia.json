    "intro": "Zephyranthes rosea var. bifolia, commonly known as the pink rain lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to Central and South America. It features two leaf-like bracts that are often pink or white, resembling petals, and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or red. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, often blooming after rainfall. Its bulbs are perennial, allowing it to survive dry periods and regrow in the wet season. This species is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize in tropical and subtropical climates."
