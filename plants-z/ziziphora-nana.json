    "intro": "Ziziphora nana, commonly known as dwarf ziziphora, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, aromatic foliage with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Ziziphora nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in traditional medicine."
