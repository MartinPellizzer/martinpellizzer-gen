    "intro": "Zhukowskia smithii, commonly known as the Smith's poppy, is a rare and flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family, which includes poppies and other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, temperate climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zhukowskia smithii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
