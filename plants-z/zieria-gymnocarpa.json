    "intro": "Zieria gymnocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-seeded zieria, is a small shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by smooth, spherical fruits. It is often found in heathlands and is adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
