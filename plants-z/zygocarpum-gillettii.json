It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its unique, woody fruit. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
