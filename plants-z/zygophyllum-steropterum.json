    "intro": "Zygophyllum steropterum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and small, fleshy, blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss and deep roots that access groundwater. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Zygophyllum steropterum is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
