    "intro": "Zanthoxylum chuquisaquense, commonly known as the Chuquisaquense prickly ash, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Zanthoxylum chuquisaquense thrives in temperate to subtropical climates and is often found in forest understories or rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of plant biodiversity in the Andes."
