    "intro": "Zingiber aromaticum, commonly known as ginger, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous root system, which is the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with colorful, fragrant bracts that are not true flowers but serve to attract pollinators. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. Ginger is widely cultivated for its pungent, spicy flavor and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries."
