It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible but have a sharp, acidic flavor. Zanthoxylum podocarpum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in herbal medicine. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Rutaceae family."
