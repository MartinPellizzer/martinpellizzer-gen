It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, leathery foliage with a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in winter, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, oval-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Zieria arborescens is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
