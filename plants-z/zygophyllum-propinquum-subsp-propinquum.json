    "intro": "Zygophyllum propinquum subsp. propinquum, commonly known as the coastal prickly-pear, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has adapted to arid and saline environments, making it resilient to drought and high salinity. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its stems store water for survival. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small animals."
