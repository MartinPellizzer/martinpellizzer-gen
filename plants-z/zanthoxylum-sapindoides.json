    "intro": "Zanthoxylum sapindoides, commonly known as the Chinese prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnate, with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its bark and roots have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
