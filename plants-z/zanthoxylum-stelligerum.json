    "intro": "Zanthoxylum stelligerum, commonly known as the rock\u82b1\u6912 or rock prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red or orange berries that are edible but have a sharp, peppery flavor due to the presence of alkaloids. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Zanthoxylum stelligerum is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses in Chinese herbal medicine."
