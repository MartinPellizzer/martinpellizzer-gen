    "intro": "Zamia linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to southeastern Mexico. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones rather than flowers. The plant has a short trunk with a crown of pinnate, linear leaves that are often described as sword-like in appearance. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
