    "intro": "Zostera marina f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf eelgrass, is a marine flowering plant found in coastal and estuarine environments. It is characterized by its broad, ribbon-like leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in width. This variant of Zostera marina exhibits a more robust and wider leaf structure compared to the typical form. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. The plant is often found in shallow waters, where it contributes to the ecological health of seagrass meadows."
