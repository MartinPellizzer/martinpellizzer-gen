    "intro": "Zygophyllum trothae, commonly known as the desert mistflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb characterized by its small, clustered flowers and fleshy, succulent leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers in dry environments. Zygophyllum trothae is well-suited to harsh, drought-prone conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy or rocky soils in its native habitat."
