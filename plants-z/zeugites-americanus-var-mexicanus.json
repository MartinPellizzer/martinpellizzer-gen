It is characterized by its spiny, paddle-shaped stems and clusters of yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are rich in vitamins and minerals. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local cultures."
