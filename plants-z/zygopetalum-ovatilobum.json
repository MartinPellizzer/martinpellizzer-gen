    "intro": "Zygopetalum ovatilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed zygopetalum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elegant, pendulous inflorescences that bear showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant has strap-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
