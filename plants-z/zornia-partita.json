It is native to the western United States and grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by narrow, bean-like pods. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a hairy texture. Zornia partita is typically a low-growing perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
