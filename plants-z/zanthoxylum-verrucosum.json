    "intro": "Zanthoxylum verrucosum, commonly known as the roughleaf prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red berries that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though it is not widely used in modern herbal medicine. Zanthoxylum verrucosum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
