    "intro": "Zinnia leptopoda, commonly known as the slender zinnia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and vibrant, daisy-like flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Zinnia leptopoda is an annual herb that produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to xeriscapic gardens and native plant landscapes."
