    "intro": "Zephyranthes capitata, commonly known as the rain lily, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its erect, grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms after rainfall, hence its common name, and produces white or pale pink petals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Zephyranthes capitata is also known for its ability to bloom rapidly following a storm, adding a fleeting beauty to the landscape."
