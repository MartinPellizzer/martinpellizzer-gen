    "intro": "Zamia brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female individuals, and produces cones rather than flowers. The plant has a short trunk and pinnate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species. The plant is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
