    "intro": "Ziziphus montana, commonly known as the rock fig, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its woody stems, compound leaves, and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments. Ziziphus montana is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
