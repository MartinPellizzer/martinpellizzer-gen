    "intro": "Zygophyllum waterlotii, commonly known as the desert fanflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, exhibiting a compact, low-growing form. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and adapted to reduce water loss, a characteristic typical of xerophytes. Zygophyllum waterlotii is well-suited to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
