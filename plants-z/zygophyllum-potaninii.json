It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from underground sources. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
