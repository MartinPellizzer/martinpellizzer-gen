    "intro": "Zexmenia kingii, commonly known as the King's zexmenia, is a rare and unique plant native to the rocky outcrops of southern Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its botanical features include narrow, leathery leaves and pale pink or white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Zexmenia kingii is considered a vulnerable species."
