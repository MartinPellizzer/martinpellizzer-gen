    "intro": "Zieria eungellaensis, commonly known as the Eungella zieria, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Epacridae, which includes heath plants and related species. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that appear during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zieria eungellaensis is considered a vulnerable species."
