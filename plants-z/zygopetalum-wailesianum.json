It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers with a unique lip structure that is typical of the Zygopetalum genus. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and fleshy, adapted to store water in the dry mountain environments where it thrives. Zygopetalum wailesianum is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
