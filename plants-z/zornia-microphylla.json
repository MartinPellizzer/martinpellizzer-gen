    "intro": "Zornia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Zornia microphylla is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open fields."
