    "intro": "Ziziphus vulgaris var. oblonga, commonly known as the longleaf ziziphus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its elongated, oblong leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, red or orange drupes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a source of edible fruit."
