    "intro": "Zigadenus porrifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf death camas, is a toxic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its herbaceous, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often mistaken for edible plants, which contributes to its danger. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and avoided in gardens where children or pets are present."
