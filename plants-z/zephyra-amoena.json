    "intro": "Zephyra amoena, commonly known as the gentle breeze flower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features slender, pale green stems that rise gracefully from a rosette of velvety, waxy leaves. Its most striking feature is its clusters of tiny, translucent blue flowers that bloom only in the early morning. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial shade to prevent leaf scorch. Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern in its natural habitat."
