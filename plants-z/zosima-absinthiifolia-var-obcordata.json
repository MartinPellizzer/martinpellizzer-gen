    "intro": "Zosima absinthiifolia var. obcordata, commonly known as the heart-shaped zosima, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale purple, typically blooming in the early spring. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution. Despite its beauty, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
