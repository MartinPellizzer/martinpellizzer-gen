    "intro": "Zephyranthes pumila, commonly known as the dwarf rain lily, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It features delicate, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom after rainfall. The plant is adapted to wetland environments and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. Zephyranthes pumila is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
