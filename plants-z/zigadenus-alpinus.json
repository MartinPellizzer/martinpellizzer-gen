    "intro": "Zigadenus alpinus, commonly known as the alpine death-cup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow, cup-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats at high elevations, often in open, sunny areas. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant produces toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. Due to its habitat and chemical composition, it is a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
