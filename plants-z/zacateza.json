    "intro": "Zacateza, commonly known as Mexican grass or *Pennisetum setaceum*, is a perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery, silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Zacateza thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. It is often used as a decorative plant in both wild and cultivated landscapes."
