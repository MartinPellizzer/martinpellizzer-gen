    "intro": "Zingiber griffithii var. major, commonly known as the giant ginger, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other gingers and turmeric. This variety is distinguished by its large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though it is less commonly cultivated than other ginger varieties."
