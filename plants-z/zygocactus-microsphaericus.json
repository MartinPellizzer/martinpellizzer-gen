It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
