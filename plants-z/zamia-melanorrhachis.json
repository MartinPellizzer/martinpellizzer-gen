    "intro": "Zamia melanorrhachis, commonly known as the black-stemmed cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a cycad, characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
