    "intro": "Zannichellia variabilis, commonly known as the variable water violet, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its submerged or floating leaves, which are often heart-shaped and have a waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically borne on long, slender stalks. It is found in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Zannichellia variabilis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water oxygenation."
