The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving it a unique tactile appearance. Its leaves are typically alternate, lance-shaped, and have a rough texture, contributing to its botanical distinctiveness. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
