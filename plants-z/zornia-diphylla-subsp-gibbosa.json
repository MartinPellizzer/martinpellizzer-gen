    "intro": "Zornia diphylla subsp. gibbosa, commonly known as the hairy zornia, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in sandy or rocky soils. Its flowering period occurs in the spring and early summer, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The subspecies gibbosa is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss and provide camouflage in its natural habitat."
