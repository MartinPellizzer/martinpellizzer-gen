It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in pairs and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its bark and berries contain compounds with medicinal properties, historically used by Native American tribes. Zanthoxylum complexum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and streambanks."
