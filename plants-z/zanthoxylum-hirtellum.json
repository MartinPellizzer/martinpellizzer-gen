    "intro": "Zanthoxylum hirtellum, commonly known as the prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Zanthoxylum hirtellum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
