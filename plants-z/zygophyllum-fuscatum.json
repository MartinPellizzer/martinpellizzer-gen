    "intro": "Zygophyllum fuscatum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing, perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, pale green to grayish leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish or reddish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water. Zygophyllum fuscatum is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
