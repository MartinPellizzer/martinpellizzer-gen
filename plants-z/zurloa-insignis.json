    "intro": "Zurloa insignis, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, which helps reflect intense sunlight. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticultural enthusiasts."
