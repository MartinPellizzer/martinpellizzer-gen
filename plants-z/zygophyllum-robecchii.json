    "intro": "Zygophyllum robecchii, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its low-growing, mat-like structure and small, clustered flowers. The plant has small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Zygophyllum robecchii is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
