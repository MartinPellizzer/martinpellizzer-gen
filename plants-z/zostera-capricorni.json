    "intro": "Zostera capricorni, commonly known as the Capricorn sea grass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It grows in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates in intertidal zones, forming dense underwater meadows. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. It plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for marine life. Zostera capricorni is also an important component of seagrass ecosystems, contributing to coastal biodiversity and carbon sequestration."
