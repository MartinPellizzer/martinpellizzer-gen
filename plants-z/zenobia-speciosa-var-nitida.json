    "intro": "Zenobia speciosa var. nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf zenobia, is a strikingly ornamental plant characterized by its silvery-white, velvety foliage. Native to the arid regions of southern Africa, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant features upright, branching stems that support clusters of small, pale green flowers. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is well-suited for Mediterranean and semi-arid climates."
