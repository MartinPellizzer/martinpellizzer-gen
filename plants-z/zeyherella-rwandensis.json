    "intro": "Zeyherella rwandensis, commonly known as the Rwandan zeyherella, is a rare flowering plant native to the montane forests of Rwanda. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy surface, and it produces capsule fruits containing several seeds. Due to habitat loss, Zeyherella rwandensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
