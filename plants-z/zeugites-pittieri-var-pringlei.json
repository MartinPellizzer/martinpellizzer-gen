It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or riverine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
