    "intro": "Zanha vuilletii, commonly known as the Madagascar zanha, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded canopy and smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zanha vuilletii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
