It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its bright yellow to orange flowers bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Zinnia tenuiflora is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in dry, rocky soils."
