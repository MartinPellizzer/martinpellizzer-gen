It is characterized by its ribbon-like, grass-like leaves that are typically submerged in shallow coastal waters. This species is native to the coastal regions of the Korean Peninsula and is adapted to brackish and saltwater environments. Zostera geojeensis plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. Its reproductive structures, including small, inconspicuous flowers, are essential for its propagation in aquatic ecosystems."
