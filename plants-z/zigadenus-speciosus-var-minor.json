    "intro": "Zigadenus speciosus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser death camas, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a toxic alkaloid called zygadenine, which makes it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Due to its toxicity and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
