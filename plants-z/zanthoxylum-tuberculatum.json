    "intro": "Zanthoxylum tuberculatum, commonly known as the roughleaf prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually odd-pinnate with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Its bark is thick and rough, with a distinctive, aromatic scent. Zanthoxylum tuberculatum is often found in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
