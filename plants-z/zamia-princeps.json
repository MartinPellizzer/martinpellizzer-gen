    "intro": "Zamia princeps, commonly known as the royal cycad, is a slow-growing, evergreen plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
