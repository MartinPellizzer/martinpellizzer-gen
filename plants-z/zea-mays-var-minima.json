    "intro": "Zea mays var. minima, commonly known as dwarf corn, is a miniature variant of maize characterized by its small stature and compact growth habit. It typically reaches heights of only a few inches, making it distinct from the towering stalks of standard corn. This variety exhibits the same basic structure as regular corn, including tassels and ears, but on a much smaller scale. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, delicate kernels that resemble those of its larger relatives. Due to its unique size and appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant or used in botanical studies."
