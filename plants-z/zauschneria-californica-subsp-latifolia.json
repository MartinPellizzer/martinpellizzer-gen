It features showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical subspecies, giving it its common name. It thrives in wet, sandy soils near streams and marshes. Zauschneria californica subsp. latifolia is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
