    "intro": "Zamia sandovalii, commonly known as the Sandoval's cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and a stout, unbranched trunk. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being larger and more elongated than the male ones. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
