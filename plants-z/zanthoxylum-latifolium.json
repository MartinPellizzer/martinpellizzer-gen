    "intro": "Zanthoxylum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 6 to 12 inches long and composed of 10 to 20 oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Zanthoxylum latifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
