It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though it is not widely cultivated for commercial use."
