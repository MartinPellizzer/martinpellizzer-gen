    "intro": "Zamia sieboldii, commonly known as the Siebold's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Zamiaceae. It is native to the Philippines and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Zamia sieboldii is considered a dioecious species, meaning individual plants are either male or female. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat threats, it is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
