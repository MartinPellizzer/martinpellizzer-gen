    "intro": "Zygophyllum darvasicum, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and adapted to reduce water loss, while its roots are deep and extensive to access groundwater. Zygophyllum darvasicum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
