    "intro": "Zexmenia gnaphalioides, commonly known as the woolly dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by fluffy, white seed heads, which are adapted for wind dispersal. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving the plant a woolly appearance. Zexmenia gnaphalioides is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads."
