    "intro": "Zanthoxylum furfuraceum, commonly known as the roughleaf prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for some birds and mammals but are generally unpalatable to humans. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its spiny branches and vibrant fall foliage."
