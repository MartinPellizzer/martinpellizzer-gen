    "intro": "Zamia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico and Central America. It is a slow-growing evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Zamia ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
