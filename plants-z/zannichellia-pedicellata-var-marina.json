    "intro": "Zannichellia pedicellata var. marina, commonly known as sea onion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its submerged or floating leaves that are often ribbon-like in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically borne in clusters at the water's surface. It thrives in brackish or saltwater environments, making it an important species in estuarine ecosystems. Zannichellia pedicellata var. marina is often used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water."
