    "intro": "Zephyranthes caaguazuensis, commonly known as the Caaguaz\u00fa rain lily, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in response to rainfall. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under the canopy of rainforests. Its bulbs are adapted for storing water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal wetlands. The Caaguaz\u00fa rain lily is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in its native habitat."
