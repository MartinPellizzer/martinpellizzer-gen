It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
