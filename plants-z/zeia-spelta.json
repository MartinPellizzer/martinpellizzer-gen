    "intro": "Zeia spelta, commonly known as spelt wheat, is an ancient grain species belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its hard, hull-covered grains and is closely related to modern wheat species. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with dense, cylindrical spikelets that contain the edible seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is well adapted to temperate climates. Zeia spelta is valued for its nutritional profile and is often cultivated for both traditional and modern culinary uses."
