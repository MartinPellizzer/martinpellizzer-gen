    "intro": "Zygophyllum flavum, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb with small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are usually small and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss. Zygophyllum flavum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
