    "intro": "Zanthoxylum serra, commonly known as the serrated prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often serrated and have a distinctive, aromatic fragrance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Zanthoxylum serra thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
