    "intro": "Zemisia discolor, commonly known as the pale zemisia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive white and green mottled leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its leaves are covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Zemisia discolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
