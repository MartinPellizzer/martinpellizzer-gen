    "intro": "Zerna yezoensis, commonly known as the Yezo zerna, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of Japan. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains, which are its reproductive structures. Zerna yezoensis is often found in wet meadows and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of grassland ecosystems."
