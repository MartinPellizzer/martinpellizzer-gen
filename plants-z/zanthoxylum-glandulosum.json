    "intro": "Zanthoxylum glandulosum, commonly known as the hairy prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though it is toxic if ingested in large quantities. Zanthoxylum glandulosum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
