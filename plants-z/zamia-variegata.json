    "intro": "Zamia variegata, commonly known as the variegated cycad, is a tropical plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically a striking combination of green and variegated yellow or white patterns, making it visually distinctive. It produces cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in warm climates."
