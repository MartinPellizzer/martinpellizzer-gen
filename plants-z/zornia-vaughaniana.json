    "intro": "Zornia vaughaniana, commonly known as Vaughan's zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it produces small, round pods that contain seeds. Zornia vaughaniana is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
