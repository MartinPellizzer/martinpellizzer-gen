    "intro": "Zornia multinervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined zornia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Zornia multinervosa plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insects."
