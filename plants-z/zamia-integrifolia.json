    "intro": "Zamia integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones rather than flowers. The plant has a stout, unbranched stem that is covered in a thick, fibrous trunk, and its leaves are large, pinnately compound, and often have a waxy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to humid, subtropical climates. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
