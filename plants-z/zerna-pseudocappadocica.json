    "intro": "Zerna pseudocappadocica, commonly known as the Cappadocian millet, is a small annual grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is often found in rocky or semi-arid habitats, where it thrives with minimal water. Zerna pseudocappadocica is valued for its hardy nature and historical use as a traditional grain crop."
