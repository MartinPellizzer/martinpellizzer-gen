    "intro": "Zamia horrida, commonly known as the spiny cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its foliage is often covered in sharp, spiny structures that provide protection against herbivores. Zamia horrida is adapted to well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
