It is a bulbous perennial that produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers in response to rainfall. The plant has strap-like leaves that are typically narrow and grass-like in appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its short blooming period, often after a rainstorm, adds a fleeting but striking beauty to the landscape."
