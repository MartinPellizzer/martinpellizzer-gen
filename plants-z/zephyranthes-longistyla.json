    "intro": "Zephyranthes longistyla, commonly known as the rain lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, upward-facing white or pale pink flowers during the rainy season. The plant is adapted to wetland environments and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a day, and it is often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Zephyranthes longistyla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
