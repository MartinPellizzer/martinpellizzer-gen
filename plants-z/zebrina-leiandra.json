    "intro": "Zebrina leiandra, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a striking member of the Araceae family, native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, striped leaves that display a bold pattern of green and white, resembling a zebra's coat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden within a spathe, a feature common to many aroid species. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its visual appeal and air-purifying qualities. Zebrina leiandra thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture to maintain its lush appearance."
