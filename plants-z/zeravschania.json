    "intro": "Zeravschania, commonly known as the mountain ash or whitebeam, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae. It consists of several species, many of which are shrubs or small trees native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. Zeravschania species often thrive in woodland or mountainous habitats and are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. Some species are also used in horticulture for their hardiness and ability to tolerate various soil conditions."
