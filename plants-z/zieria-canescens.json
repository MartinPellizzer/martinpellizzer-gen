    "intro": "Zieria canescens, commonly known as the grey zieria, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and has small, elliptical, grey-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by small, woody fruits. Zieria canescens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
