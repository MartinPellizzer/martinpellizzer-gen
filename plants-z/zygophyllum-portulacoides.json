    "intro": "Zygophyllum portulacoides, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing, succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has small, fleshy, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Zygophyllum portulacoides is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
