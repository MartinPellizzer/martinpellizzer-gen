    "intro": "Zurloa, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features silvery-gray leaves covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow during the spring and summer months. Zurloa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping in drought-prone areas."
