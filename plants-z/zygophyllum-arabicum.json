    "intro": "Zygophyllum arabicum, commonly known as the desert candle or white thorn, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapting well to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration. Zygophyllum arabicum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
