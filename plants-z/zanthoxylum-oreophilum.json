    "intro": "Zanthoxylum oreophilum, commonly known as the red buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often have a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, and the plant is often found in moist, wooded areas. Zanthoxylum oreophilum has a strong, aromatic scent and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
