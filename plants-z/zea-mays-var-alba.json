    "intro": "Zea mays var. alba, commonly known as white maize, is a variant of maize characterized by its pale or white kernels instead of the typical yellow or blue. It is a member of the grass family, Poaceae, and is native to the Americas, particularly Mexico. The plant typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 3 meters, with tall, slender stalks and large, narrow leaves. Its flowers are spike-like, with male and female inflorescences separated, and it is primarily cultivated for its starchy seeds. This variety is less common in modern agriculture but holds cultural and historical significance in some indigenous communities."
