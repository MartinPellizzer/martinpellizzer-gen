    "intro": "Zamia muricata, commonly known as the spiny cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Central America. It is a perennial plant characterized by its stout, woody trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are often covered in small, spiny protrusions, giving it a distinctive appearance. Zamia muricata is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil."
