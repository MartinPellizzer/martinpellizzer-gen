It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its roots are fibrous and well-developed, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, humus-rich soil. Zygopetalum brachystalix is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a warm, humid environment."
