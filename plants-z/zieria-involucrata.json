    "intro": "Zieria involucrata, commonly known as the white zieria, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Epacridaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
