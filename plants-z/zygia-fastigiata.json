It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in terminal panicles. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture for its fine texture and seasonal color changes. Zygia fastigiata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
