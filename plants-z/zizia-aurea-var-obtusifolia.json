It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic with rounded tips, and it produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring. The plant has a short, stout stem that supports its foliage and floral display. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Its showy blooms make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
