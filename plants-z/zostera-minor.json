    "intro": "Zostera minor, commonly known as the lesser eelgrass, is a marine flowering plant found in shallow coastal waters. It belongs to the family Zosteraceae and is characterized by its ribbon-like, blade-shaped leaves. This plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. Zostera minor typically grows in dense underwater meadows, often in areas with low wave action. Its reproductive structures, including small flowers and fruits, are adapted for underwater pollination and dispersal."
