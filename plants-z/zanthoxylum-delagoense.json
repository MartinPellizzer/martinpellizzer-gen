    "intro": "Zanthoxylum delagoense, commonly known as the African prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, irritating hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds and mammals. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though it is toxic if ingested in large quantities. Zanthoxylum delagoense thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks."
