    "intro": "Zebrina pendula, commonly known as the hanging zebra plant, is a striking member of the Araceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, warm environments. The plant is characterized by its cascading, waxy leaves that display vibrant, alternating green and silver stripes, giving it its common name. Its flowering inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, which adds to its ornamental appeal. Zebrina pendula is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in indirect light and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
