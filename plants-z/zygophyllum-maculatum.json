    "intro": "Zygophyllum maculatum, commonly known as the spotted sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding visual interest to its dry habitat. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater and survive prolonged droughts. Zygophyllum maculatum is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes."
