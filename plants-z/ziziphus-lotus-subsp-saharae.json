    "intro": "Ziziphus lotus subsp. saharae, commonly known as the Saharan date palm, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible fruits resembling dates. The plant is adapted to extreme drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in sandy soils. It is often found in rocky or mountainous areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing limited food resources. The subspecies is valued for its resilience and has been used traditionally for its fruit and medicinal properties."
