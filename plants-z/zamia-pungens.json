    "intro": "Zamia pungens, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a cycad native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and a distinctive, tree-like trunk that is covered in a fibrous, spongy material. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobili, which contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often epiphytic, growing on the surfaces of trees or rocks. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular ornamental plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
