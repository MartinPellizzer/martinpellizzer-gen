    "intro": "Zingiber fraseri var. major, commonly known as the giant ginger or Fraser's ginger, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers with a strong, spicy aroma. Its rhizomes are similar to those of other gingers but are less commonly used in culinary applications. Botanically, it belongs to the Zingiberaceae family and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
