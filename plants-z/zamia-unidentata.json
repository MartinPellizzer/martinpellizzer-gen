    "intro": "Zamia unidentata, commonly known as the smooth zamia, is a cycad species native to the southeastern United States. It is a slow-growing plant with a stout, unbranched stem that remains underground for most of its life. The plant produces large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its reproductive structures include a terminal cone, with both male and female cones present on the same plant. Zamia unidentata is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade."
