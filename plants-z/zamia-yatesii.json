    "intro": "Zamia yatesii, commonly known as the Yate's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Zamia yatesii is considered a vulnerable species."
