    "intro": "Zostera stipulacea, commonly known as the narrow leaf eelgrass, is a seagrass species native to the coastal regions of the eastern and western Atlantic Ocean. It typically grows in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates in tidal zones, forming dense underwater meadows. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are usually narrow and strap-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface. It plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. Zostera stipulacea is also important for carbon sequestration and supports biodiversity in marine environments."
