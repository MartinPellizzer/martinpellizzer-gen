    "intro": "Zamia gleina, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a slow-growing plant with a stout, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a fibrous, spongy layer. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. It flowers in cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Zamia gleina is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage."
