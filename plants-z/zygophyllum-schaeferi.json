    "intro": "Zygophyllum schaeferi, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a hardy shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its deep root system, which allows it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse seeds by wind. Its dense, woody structure provides habitat and shelter for various desert wildlife. Zygophyllum schaeferi is an important component of desert ecosystems, contributing to soil stability and biodiversity in harsh environments."
