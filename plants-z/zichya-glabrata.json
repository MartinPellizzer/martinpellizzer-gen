    "intro": "Zichya glabrata, commonly known as the smooth ziziphus, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by edible, red berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Zichya glabrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate drought and salty conditions."
