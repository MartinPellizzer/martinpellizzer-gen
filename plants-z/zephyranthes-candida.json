It produces delicate, white, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom after rainfall, typically in summer. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Zephyranthes candida is a short-lived perennial that spreads vegetatively through its bulbs."
