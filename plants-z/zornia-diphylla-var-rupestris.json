    "intro": "Zornia diphylla var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock zornia, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments, and it is adapted to full sun exposure. Zornia diphylla var. rupestris is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native range."
