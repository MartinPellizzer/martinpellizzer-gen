    "intro": "Zaluzania megacephala, commonly known as the large-headed false sunflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers with prominent brown centers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Zaluzania megacephala thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and disturbed areas."
