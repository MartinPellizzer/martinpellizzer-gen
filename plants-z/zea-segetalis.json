    "intro": "Zea segetalis, commonly known as the dwarf maize, is a species of grass native to the Americas. It is a close relative of the common corn, Zea mays, and is characterized by its small stature and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and produces small, clustered ears of grain. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a smooth surface, and it thrives in temperate climates. Zea segetalis is often studied for its genetic relationships and potential agricultural applications."
