    "intro": "Zea mays var. pyrocarpa, commonly known as the fire corn or pyrocarpa maize, is a variant of maize characterized by its unique, flame-like tassel and striking red and orange tassels. It is a tall, annual grass that thrives in warm climates and is native to the Americas. The plant produces large, white to yellowish ears of grain, which are typically harvested for their starchy kernels. Its ornamental features make it popular in gardens, while its genetic traits are also studied for potential agricultural applications. The plant's botanical structure includes a robust stem, broad leaves, and a complex inflorescence that distinguishes it from common maize varieties."
