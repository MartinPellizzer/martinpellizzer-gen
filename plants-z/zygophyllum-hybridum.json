    "intro": "Zygophyllum hybridum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, exhibiting drought tolerance and heat resistance. The plant produces small, yellow or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and adapted to minimize water loss, and it has a deep root system to access groundwater. Zygophyllum hybridum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
