    "intro": "Zanthoxylum tumbezanum, commonly known as the Tumbezan prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often pinnately arranged and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Zanthoxylum tumbezanum is also noted for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
