    "intro": "Ziziphora, commonly known as sweetwood or mountain savory, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. It consists of about 40 species, predominantly found in temperate and subtropical regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plants are typically shrubs or herbs with aromatic, often hairy leaves and small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Ziziphora species are known for their strong, spicy scent and are often used in traditional herbal medicine. They play an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to their nectar-rich flowers."
