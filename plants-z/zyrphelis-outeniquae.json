    "intro": "Zyrphelis outeniquae, commonly known as the Trinidadian starflower, is a flowering plant native to the island of Trinidad in the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Zyrphelis outeniquae is a relatively rare species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
