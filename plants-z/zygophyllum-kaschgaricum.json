It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert ecosystems. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
