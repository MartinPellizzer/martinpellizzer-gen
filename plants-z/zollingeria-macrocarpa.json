    "intro": "Zollingeria macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited zollingeria, is a member of the Rubiaceae family. It is a deciduous shrub native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. Its flowers are small and white, clustered in inflorescences, and it produces berries that are edible for certain animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
