    "intro": "Zexmenia frutescens, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces dark, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and rich color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, warm climate. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its natural habitat."
