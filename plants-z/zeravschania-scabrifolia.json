    "intro": "Zeravschania scabrifolia, commonly known as the Afghan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. The plant has hairy, grayish leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine zones. Zeravschania scabrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
