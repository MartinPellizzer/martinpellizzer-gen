    "intro": "Zygia foreroi, commonly known as the Forero's zygia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zygia foreroi is considered a species of conservation concern."
