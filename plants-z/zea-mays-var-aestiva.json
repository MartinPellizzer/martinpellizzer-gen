    "intro": "Zea mays var. aestiva, commonly known as the Mexican corn or ornamental corn, is a variant of maize with distinct botanical features. It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and large, showy tassels that are often used in ornamental displays. The plant produces ears of corn that are typically smaller and more colorful than those of standard maize varieties. Its leaves are broad and blade-like, contributing to its striking visual appearance. This variant is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than for food production."
