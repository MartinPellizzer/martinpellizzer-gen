    "intro": "Zaluzianskya capensis, commonly known as the Cape bellflower, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features succulent, cylindrical stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 30 cm in height. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to store water, which is typical for its arid native habitat. Zaluzianskya capensis is often grown as an ornamental plant in gardens due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
