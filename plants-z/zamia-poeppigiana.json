    "intro": "Zamia poeppigiana, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a perennial plant native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is characterized by its stiff, arching leaves that form a rosette pattern. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate sunlight, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
