    "intro": "Zyrphelis decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent zyrphelis, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features slender, creeping stems that often lie flat on the ground, with small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, arranged in clusters, and are known for their delicate appearance. Zyrphelis decumbens plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
