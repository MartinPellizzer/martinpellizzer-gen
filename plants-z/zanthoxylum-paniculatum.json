    "intro": "Zanthoxylum paniculatum, commonly known as the Chinese prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and consist of 5-9 elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and animals. Zanthoxylum paniculatum is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates."
