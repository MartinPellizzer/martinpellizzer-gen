It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, adapting to the harsh conditions of its environment. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Zornia andicola plays a role in local ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing forage for grazing animals."
