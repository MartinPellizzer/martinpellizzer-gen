    "intro": "Zea mays var. caesia, commonly known as the blue corn or royal corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its striking blue or purple pigmentation in the kernels. This coloration is due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which are responsible for the plant's distinctive appearance. It is native to Mexico and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for traditional uses. The plant typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 2 meters, with tall, sturdy stalks and tassel-like inflorescences. It is a diploid species with a genome size of approximately 2.3 gigabases, making it an important subject in genetic and agricultural research."
