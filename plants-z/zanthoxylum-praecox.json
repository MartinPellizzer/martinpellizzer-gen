    "intro": "Zanthoxylum praecox, commonly known as the prickly ash or yellow sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have small, sharp spines along the leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Zanthoxylum praecox thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
