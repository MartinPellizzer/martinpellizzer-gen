    "intro": "Zannichellia pedunculata var. maritima, commonly known as sea onion or maritime water starwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its submerged or floating leaves, which are typically narrow and elongated, adapted for aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often emerging from the water surface. It thrives in brackish or saltwater conditions, making it a common inhabitant of estuaries and tidal zones. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its ecological significance in coastal wetlands."
