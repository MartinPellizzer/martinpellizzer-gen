    "intro": "Zamia nigra, commonly known as the black zamia, is a cycad species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Zamia nigra is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential ecological and medicinal properties."
