    "intro": "Zygia vasquezii, commonly known as the V\u00e1squez's zygia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, pentapetalous flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zygia vasquezii is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
