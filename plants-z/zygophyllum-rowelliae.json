    "intro": "Zygophyllum rowelliae, commonly known as the Rowell's jointvetch, is a low-growing, succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater and stabilize sandy soils. Zygophyllum rowelliae is often found in coastal dunes and inland plains, where it plays a role in preventing soil erosion."
