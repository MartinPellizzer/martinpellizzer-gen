    "intro": "Zerna aristata, commonly known as the tall zerna, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, wiry stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green coloration. Zerna aristata is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
