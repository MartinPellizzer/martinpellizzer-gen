    "intro": "Zephyranthes macrosiphon, commonly known as the rain lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the southern United States, Central America, and northern South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in response to rainfall. Its bulbs are underground and serve as storage organs, allowing the plant to survive dry periods. Zephyranthes macrosiphon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, ephemeral blooms."
