It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually pinnately arranged and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries, which are a source of food for various wildlife species. Zanthoxylum furcyense is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
