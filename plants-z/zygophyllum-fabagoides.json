    "intro": "Zygophyllum fabagoides, commonly known as the desert tea or sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and Southwestern Asia. It is a low-growing, shrub-like plant with succulent leaves that help it retain water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Zygophyllum fabagoides is well adapted to survive in extreme drought and high temperatures, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
