    "intro": "Zygophyllum flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible leaf chenopod, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. Zygophyllum flexuosum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native fauna."
