    "intro": "Zinnia oligantha, commonly known as the desert zinnia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and vibrant, daisy-like flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Zinnia oligantha produces small, cylindrical flower heads that are typically 1 to 2 inches in diameter. It is a hardy species that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and wildflower gardens."
