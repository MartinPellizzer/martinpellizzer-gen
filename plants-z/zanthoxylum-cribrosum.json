    "intro": "Zanthoxylum cribrosum, commonly known as the Australian prickly ash, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually alternate and consist of 5 to 11 pairs of ovate to elliptic leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for some wildlife. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, and it is often used in traditional herbal remedies. Zanthoxylum cribrosum is adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
