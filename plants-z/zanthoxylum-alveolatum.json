    "intro": "Zanthoxylum alveolatum, commonly known as the Mexican prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant's structure and growth habits make it well adapted to a variety of soil types and environmental conditions."
