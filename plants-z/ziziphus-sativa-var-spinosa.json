It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are often used in traditional medicine and local cuisines. Its leaves are compound, with multiple leaflets that provide shade and are sometimes used for thatching. The spiny date palm is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in poor soils."
