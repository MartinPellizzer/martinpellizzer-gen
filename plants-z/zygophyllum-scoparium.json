    "intro": "Zygophyllum scoparium, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, often blue or purple-colored leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Zygophyllum scoparium is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ability to stabilize soils in degraded landscapes."
