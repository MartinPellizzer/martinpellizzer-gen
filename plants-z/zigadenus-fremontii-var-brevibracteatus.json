    "intro": "Zigadenus fremontii var. brevibracteatus, commonly known as the short-bract death camas, is a member of the Melanthiaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and prairies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its toxic alkaloids make it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. Despite its dangers, it plays an important role in its ecosystem and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
