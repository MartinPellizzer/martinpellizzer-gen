    "intro": "Zeuxine tripleura, commonly known as the Himalayan blue poppy, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family, which includes poppies and related species. The plant is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat. Zeuxine tripleura is a rare and protected species, often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters."
