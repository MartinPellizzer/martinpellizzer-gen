    "intro": "Zinnia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf zinnia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and vibrant, daisy-like flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Its flowers are composed of a central disk surrounded by ray florets, which are often used in floral arrangements. Zinnia angustifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
