    "intro": "Zamia hamannii, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to parts of Mexico. It is a slow-growing plant with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
