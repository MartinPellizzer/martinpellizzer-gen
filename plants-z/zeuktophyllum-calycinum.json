    "intro": "Zeuktophyllum calycinum, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. Zeuktophyllum calycinum is prized in horticulture for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
