    "intro": "Zanthoxylum armatum, commonly known as the prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the United States. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, branched spines. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its bark and fruits contain compounds such as lignans and alkaloids, which have been used in traditional medicine. Zanthoxylum armatum thrives in woodland areas and is often found in the eastern and central regions of North America."
