    "intro": "Zamia roezlii, commonly known as the R\u00f6szli's cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family, native to Mexico. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and exhibits a slow growth rate. The plant produces cones, with male cones bearing microsporangia and female cones containing ovules. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, feather-like appearance, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often found in protected habitats."
