    "intro": "Zanthoxylum clavatum, commonly known as the prickly ash or Indian prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their stimulant and analgesic properties. Zanthoxylum clavatum thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
