    "intro": "Zeylanidium barberi, commonly known as the Ceylon sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its fragrant, yellowish wood that is highly valued in the perfume and incense industries. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered critically endangered in its native range."
