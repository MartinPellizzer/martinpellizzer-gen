    "intro": "Zamia monticola, commonly known as the mountain cycad, is a species of cycad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and unique morphology, it is valued as a ornamental plant in horticulture."
