    "intro": "Zanthoxylum schinifolium f. inerme, commonly known as the smooth-leafed prickly ash, is a variant of the prickly ash plant native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, often hairless leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its distinctive appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitat."
