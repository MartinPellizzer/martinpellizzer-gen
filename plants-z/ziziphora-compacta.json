It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant features aromatic, gray-green leaves and produces small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Ziziphora compacta is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
