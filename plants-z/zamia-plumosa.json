    "intro": "Zamia plumosa, commonly known as the feather fern cycad, is a species of cycad native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several feet in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and it is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage. Zamia plumosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
