    "intro": "Zanthoxylum petiolare, commonly known as the prickly ash or red prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually 5 to 9 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark and berries contain compounds with medicinal properties, historically used by Indigenous peoples. Zanthoxylum petiolare thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream valleys."
