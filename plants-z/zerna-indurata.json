    "intro": "Zerna indurata, commonly known as the hardseed grass, is a perennial plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are encased in a hard, durable coat, which aids in seed dispersal and survival in harsh environments. Zerna indurata is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates."
