    "intro": "Zanthoxylum semiarticulatum, commonly known as the Mexican prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a spicy, peppery flavor due to the presence of alkaloids. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas. Its ornamental value and medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest in horticulture and traditional herbal practices."
