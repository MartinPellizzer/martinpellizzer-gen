    "intro": "Zanthoxylum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Zanthoxylum parviflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
