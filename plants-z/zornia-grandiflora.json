    "intro": "Zornia grandiflora, commonly known as the largeflower zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, thriving in moist, sandy soils. It produces small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Zornia grandiflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
