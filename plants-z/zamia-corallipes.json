    "intro": "Zamia corallipes, commonly known as the coral-leaf cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, coral-like leaves that are fan-shaped and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
