    "intro": "Zamia lehmanniana, commonly known as the Lehmann's cycad, is a slow-growing, evergreen plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones developing on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
