    "intro": "Zanthoxylum clava-herculis subsp. fruticosum, commonly known as the prickly ash or American prickly ash, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into several narrow, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. These flowers give way to red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The plant is also notable for its spiny stems and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
