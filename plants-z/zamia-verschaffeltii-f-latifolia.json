It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its foliage is often used in traditional landscaping due to its ornamental appearance. The species is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soil and partial shade."
