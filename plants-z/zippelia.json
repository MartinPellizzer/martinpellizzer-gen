    "intro": "Zippelia, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Zippelia montana, which is native to the eastern United States. The plants are herbaceous perennials that typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They produce showy, umbel-like clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in the spring. The leaves are usually alternate, lance-shaped, and have a distinct, somewhat waxy texture."
