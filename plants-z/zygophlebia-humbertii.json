    "intro": "Zygophlebia humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's zygophlebia, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs known for their medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are usually opposite and elliptical, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zygophlebia humbertii is considered a species of conservation concern."
