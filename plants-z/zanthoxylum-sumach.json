    "intro": "Zanthoxylum sumach, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 11 leaflets, and its bright red, fuzzy fruits that appear in clusters. The plant is often found in dry, sunny areas such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its bark is thick and ridged, and it has a strong, spicy aroma due to the presence of volatile oils. Zanthoxylum sumach is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
