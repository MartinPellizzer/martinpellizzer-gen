    "intro": "Zanthoxylum hirsutum, commonly known as the prickly ash or hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Zanthoxylum hirsutum is typically found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine. Its bark and roots have been used by Indigenous peoples for various medicinal purposes."
