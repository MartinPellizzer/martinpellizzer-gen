    "intro": "Zornia diphylla f. diversifolia, commonly known as the variable zornia, is a flowering plant species belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive two-leaf form, with the lower leaf being larger and more elongated than the upper one. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
