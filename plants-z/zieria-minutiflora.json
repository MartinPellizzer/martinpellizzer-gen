    "intro": "Zieria minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf zieria, is a small shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are usually covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
