    "intro": "Zamia terrestris, commonly known as the ground zamia, is a cycad-like plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, underground stem and a rosette of long, strap-like leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, Zamia terrestris is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
