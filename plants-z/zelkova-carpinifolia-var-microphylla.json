    "intro": "Zelkova carpinifolia var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved zelkova, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm in length, with a smooth margin and a glossy upper surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release small, winged seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant form and seasonal interest."
