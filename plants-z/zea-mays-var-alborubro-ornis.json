    "intro": "Zea mays var. alborubro-ornis, commonly known as the ornamental corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its vibrant, showy tassels. This plant exhibits striking red, orange, and white tassel colors, which distinguish it from typical corn varieties. It is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than for grain production. The plant has a tall, sturdy stalk with broad, narrow leaves typical of maize species. It thrives in warm climates and is often used in ornamental gardens and as a decorative plant."
