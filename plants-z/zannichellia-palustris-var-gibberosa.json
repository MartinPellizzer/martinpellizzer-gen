    "intro": "Zannichellia palustris var. gibberosa, commonly known as the hairy waterwort, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in dense clusters at the water's surface. Zannichellia palustris var. gibberosa plays a role in stabilizing aquatic environments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
