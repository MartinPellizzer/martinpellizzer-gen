    "intro": "Zornia havanensis, commonly known as the Cuban zornia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its seed pods are slender and contain several small, rounded seeds. Zornia havanensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
