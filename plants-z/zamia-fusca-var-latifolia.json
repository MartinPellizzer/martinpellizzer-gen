    "intro": "Zamia fusca var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cycad, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
