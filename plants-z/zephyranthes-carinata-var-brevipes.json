    "intro": "Zephyranthes carinata var. brevipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rain lily, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense clumps, and is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate, ephemeral blooms."
