    "intro": "Ziziphus rugosa, commonly known as the Chinese date or rough date, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in a rough, fissured bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to edible, fleshy berries resembling dates in appearance. These berries are typically red to orange when ripe and are consumed both fresh and dried. Ziziphus rugosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
