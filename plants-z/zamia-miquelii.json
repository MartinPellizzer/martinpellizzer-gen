    "intro": "Zamia miquelii, commonly known as the Miquel's cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody, spiny seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Zamia miquelii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
