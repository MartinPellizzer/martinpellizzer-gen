    "intro": "Zamia inermis, commonly known as the smooth zamia, is a cycad-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Zamia inermis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in suitable growing conditions."
