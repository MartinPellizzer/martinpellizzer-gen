    "intro": "Zieria euthadenia, commonly known as the pink zieria, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the family Epacridaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
