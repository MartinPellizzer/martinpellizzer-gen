    "intro": "Zygophyllum schreiberianum, commonly known as the desert raisin or Schreiber's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its small, showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the morning, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Zygophyllum schreiberianum is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh desert environments."
