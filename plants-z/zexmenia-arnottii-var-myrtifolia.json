    "intro": "Zexmenia arnottii var. myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved zexmenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of southern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria. The plant is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves that resemble those of the myrtle tree, hence its common name. It produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This variety is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds."
