    "intro": "Zanthoxylum fraxineum, commonly known as the yellow prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its bark and leaves contain compounds such as alkaloids and flavonoids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Zanthoxylum fraxineum is often found in moist woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
