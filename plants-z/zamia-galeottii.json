    "intro": "Zamia galeottii, commonly known as the Galeotti's cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones typically found at the base of the plant and the female cones emerging higher up. Zamia galeottii is adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
