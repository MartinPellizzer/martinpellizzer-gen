    "intro": "Zornia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf zornia, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. It produces small, dry pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Zornia angustifolia is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
