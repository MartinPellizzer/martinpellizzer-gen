    "intro": "Zanthoxylum camphoratum, commonly known as the prickly ash or camphor tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 4 to 10 inches long and consist of 5 to 11 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its bark and leaves contain compounds such as camphor and lignocellulose, making it valuable in traditional medicine and as a source of natural products. Zanthoxylum camphoratum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks."
