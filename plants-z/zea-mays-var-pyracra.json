    "intro": "Zea mays var. pyracra, commonly known as the purple corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its striking violet to purple-colored kernels. This plant is native to the Andean regions of South America, where it has been cultivated for centuries by indigenous communities. The botanical features include tall stalks with broad, lance-shaped leaves and compact tassels at the top. Its unique pigmentation is due to high concentrations of anthocyanins, which also contribute to its nutritional value. The plant is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its use in traditional foods and beverages."
