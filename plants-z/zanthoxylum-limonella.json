    "intro": "Zanthoxylum limonella, commonly known as the lemon thorn or yellow prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually 5 to 9 leaflets, and its distinctive yellow or orange berries that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by the development of its spiny fruit clusters. Zanthoxylum limonella is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, and it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals."
