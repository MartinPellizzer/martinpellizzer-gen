    "intro": "Zanthoxylum thouvenotii, commonly known as the African prickly ash, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Zanthoxylum thouvenotii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
