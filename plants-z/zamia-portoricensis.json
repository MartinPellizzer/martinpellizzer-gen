    "intro": "Zamia portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican cycad, is a rare gymnosperm native to the island of Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in the understory of tropical forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
