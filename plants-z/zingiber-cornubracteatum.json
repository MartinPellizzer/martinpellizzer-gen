It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other gingers, and is characterized by its ornamental, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained, fertile soil. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in botanical gardens."
