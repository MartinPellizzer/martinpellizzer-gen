    "intro": "Zexmenia phyllocephala, commonly known as the leaf-headed zexmenia, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, flat leaves that resemble a head, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in shades of white and green. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Zexmenia phyllocephala is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
