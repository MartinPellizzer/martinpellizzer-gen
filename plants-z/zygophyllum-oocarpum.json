    "intro": "Zygophyllum oocarpum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing, perennial shrub that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in coastal and inland deserts. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically small and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Zygophyllum oocarpum plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for desert fauna."
