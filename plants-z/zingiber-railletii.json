    "intro": "Zingiber railletii, commonly known as the Raillet's ginger, is a rare and lesser-known species of ginger native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other well-known gingers such as turmeric and cardamom. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its rhizomes, while not as widely used as those of other gingers, are occasionally cultivated for their potential medicinal properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zingiber railletii is considered a delicate and endangered species."
