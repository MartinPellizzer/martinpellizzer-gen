    "intro": "Zanthoxylum pterota, commonly known as the winged prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins and distinctive winged petioles. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Zanthoxylum pterota thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine make it a notable species in its native habitat."
