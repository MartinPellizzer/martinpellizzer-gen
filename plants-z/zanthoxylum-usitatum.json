    "intro": "Zanthoxylum usitatum, commonly known as the prickly ash or yellow cedar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually alternate and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Zanthoxylum usitatum is also notable for its aromatic bark and wood, which have been used traditionally for medicinal and practical purposes. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Rutaceae family."
