It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for some wildlife but contain irritants for humans. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is notable for its thorny stems and distinctive venation patterns on its foliage."
