    "intro": "Zea altissima, commonly known as the giant maize or tall corn, is a tall grass species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks that can grow up to 6 meters in height, with large, narrow leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically greenish or purplish in color. Zea altissima is closely related to maize (Zea mays) and is considered an ancestor of domesticated corn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks."
