    "intro": "Zederachia, commonly known as the desert willow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their slender, often twisted stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Zederachia species are adapted to drought conditions, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. They are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value."
