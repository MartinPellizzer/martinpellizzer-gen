    "intro": "Ziziphus rivularis, commonly known as the river thorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, alternate leaves, and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe, and are often consumed by wildlife and humans. Ziziphus rivularis is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils and low-water environments."
