    "intro": "Zygophyllum gypsophilum, commonly known as the gypsum bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, green, bladder-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those containing gypsum, which is reflected in its common name. Zygophyllum gypsophilum is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
