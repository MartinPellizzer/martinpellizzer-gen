    "intro": "Zeocriton distichon, commonly known as the two-leaf zeocriton, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring two distinct leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant exhibits a succulent growth habit, allowing it to store water in its fleshy tissues, which is an adaptation to its arid environment. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in shades of white and pale blue, and are pollinated by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Zeocriton distichon is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
