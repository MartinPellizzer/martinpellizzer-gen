    "intro": "Zootrophion hirtzii, commonly known as the hairy zootrophion, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are adaptations to its arid or semi-arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Zootrophion hirtzii is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
