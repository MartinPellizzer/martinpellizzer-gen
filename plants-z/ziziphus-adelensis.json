    "intro": "Ziziphus adelensis, commonly known as the Adelaide thornapple, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often thorny, and its compound leaves that are typically alternate. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. Ziziphus adelensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates. It plays a role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife in its native range."
