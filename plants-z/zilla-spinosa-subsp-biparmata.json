    "intro": "Zilla spinosa subsp. biparmata, commonly known as the narrowleaf zilla, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Its botanical features include a woody stem, glandular hairs on the leaves, and a distinctive branching pattern. It is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
