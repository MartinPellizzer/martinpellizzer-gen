It typically grows in heathlands and sclerophyllous forests, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are borne in clusters during the spring. Zieria pilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native garden landscapes."
