    "intro": "Zieria, commonly known as the fairy candles, is a genus of flowering plants native to Australia. These plants typically feature small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often resembling candles in shape. They are part of the family Epacridaceae and are characterized by their evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. Zieria species are often found in heathlands and sclerophyllous forests, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they require specific conditions to flourish."
