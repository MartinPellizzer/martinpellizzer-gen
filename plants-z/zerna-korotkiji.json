    "intro": "Zerna korotkiji, commonly known as dwarf wheat, is a small grain plant belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short stature, typically reaching only a few inches in height. The plant produces small, cylindrical spikelets that contain tiny grains of wheat, which are used for various traditional purposes. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its hardiness and historical significance, it is sometimes cultivated as a heritage or forage crop."
