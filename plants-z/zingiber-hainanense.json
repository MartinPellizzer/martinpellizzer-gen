    "intro": "Zingiber hainanense, commonly known as Hainan ginger, is a rare and lesser-known species of ginger native to the island of Hainan in China. It is a rhizomatous herb that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in inflorescences. Its rhizomes are similar to other ginger species but are less commonly used in culinary applications. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
