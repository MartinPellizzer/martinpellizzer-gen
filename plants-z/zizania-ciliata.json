    "intro": "Zizania ciliata, commonly known as flathead wild rice, is a tall, aquatic grass native to the wetlands of North America. It thrives in shallow waters and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant produces edible grains that have been historically harvested by Indigenous peoples for food and cultural practices. Zizania ciliata plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its growth is often influenced by water levels, soil composition, and seasonal flooding."
