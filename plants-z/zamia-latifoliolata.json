    "intro": "Zamia latifoliolata, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and is characterized by its large, leathery, compound leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male cones producing pollen and female cones developing into seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
