    "intro": "Zerna pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of the Pamir Mountains. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its resilience and low maintenance, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in mountainous regions."
