    "intro": "Zamia pygmaea var. kickxii, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a compact, slow-growing cycad species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It features a short, stout stem with a dense crown of feathery, glossy green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by reddish-brown, spiky fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is popular among cycad enthusiasts and collectors."
