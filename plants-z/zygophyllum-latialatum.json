    "intro": "Zygophyllum latialatum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to reddish-orange. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access moisture deep in the soil. Zygophyllum latialatum plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
