    "intro": "Zanthoxylum kellermanii, commonly known as the Kellerman's prickly ash, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodlands. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into narrow, pointed leaflets, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The fruit is a red, fleshy drupe that matures in the fall and is an important food source for birds and small mammals. Zanthoxylum kellermanii is also valued for its ornamental qualities and its historical use in traditional medicine."
