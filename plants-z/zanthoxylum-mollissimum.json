    "intro": "Zanthoxylum mollissimum, commonly known as the velvet tamarack, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-brown bark and compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in terminal clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological contributions to desert ecosystems."
