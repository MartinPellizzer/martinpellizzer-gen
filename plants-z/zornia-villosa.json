    "intro": "Zornia villosa, commonly known as hairy zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in dry, disturbed soils. Zornia villosa is a low-growing perennial that thrives in arid environments and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardiness."
