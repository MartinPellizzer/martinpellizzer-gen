    "intro": "Zinnia multiflora var. rubra, commonly known as the red zinnia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange-pink flowers, which bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows as an annual, reaching heights of 1 to 3 feet with a bushy, upright habit. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Zinnia multiflora var. rubra is well-suited for garden cultivation due to its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
