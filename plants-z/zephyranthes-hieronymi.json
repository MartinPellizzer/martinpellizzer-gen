    "intro": "Zephyranthes hieronymi, commonly known as the rain lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a bulbous plant that produces showy, white or pale pink flowers during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are often short-lived but appear in clusters, making it a striking addition to gardens. Zephyranthes hieronymi is also known for its ability to bloom after rainfall, hence its common name."
