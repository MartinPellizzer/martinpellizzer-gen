    "intro": "Zizania terrestris, commonly known as the marsh panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and it produces small, brownish seeds that are dispersed by water or wind. Zizania terrestris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
