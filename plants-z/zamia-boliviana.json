It is a slow-growing plant with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, spiral leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, which are pollinated by insects. Zamia boliviana is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and historical significance."
