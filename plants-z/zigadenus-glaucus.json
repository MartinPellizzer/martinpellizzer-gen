    "intro": "Zigadenus glaucus, commonly known as death cup, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant produces toxic alkaloids, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided by herbivores, which helps it thrive in competitive environments."
