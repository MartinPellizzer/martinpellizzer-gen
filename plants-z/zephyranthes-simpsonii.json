    "intro": "Zephyranthes simpsonii, commonly known as the Simpson's rain lily, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and thrives in wetlands and marshy areas. The plant produces delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, often during the summer months. Its leaves are grass-like and narrow, forming a basal rosette that helps it survive in wet environments. Zephyranthes simpsonii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
