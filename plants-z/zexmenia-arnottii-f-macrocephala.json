    "intro": "Zexmenia arnottii f. macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed zexmenia, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbels, creating a striking visual display. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky outcrops and sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its foliage consists of finely divided, aromatic leaves that are often used in traditional herbal medicine. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
