It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to white. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often forming a compact rosette structure. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its native arid environment. Zygogynum bullatum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
