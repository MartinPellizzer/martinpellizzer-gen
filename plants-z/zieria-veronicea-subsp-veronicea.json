    "intro": "Zieria veronicea subsp. veronicea, commonly known as the coastal zieria, is a small shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained, acidic conditions. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for native garden landscapes. It is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
