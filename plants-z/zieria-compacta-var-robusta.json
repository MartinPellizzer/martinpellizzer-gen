    "intro": "Zieria compacta var. robusta, commonly known as the robust zieria, is a low-growing shrub native to eastern Australia. It features small, glossy, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters along its stems. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant collections."
