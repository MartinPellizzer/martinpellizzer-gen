    "intro": "Zoysia sinica var. nipponica, commonly known as Japanese zoysia, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, with a dense growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and form a thick sod. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in ornamental landscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in partial shade make it a popular choice for lawns and ground cover."
