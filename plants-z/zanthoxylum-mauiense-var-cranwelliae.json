    "intro": "Zanthoxylum mauiense var. cranwelliae, commonly known as the Maui prickly ash, is a rare and endemic species native to Hawaii. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its spiny branches and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in coastal and dry forest habitats, often growing on rocky or limestone substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
