    "intro": "Zeuxine papillosa, commonly known as the hairy zeuxine, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes buttercups and other showy wildflowers. The plant is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three parts, and are covered in fine, soft hairs. Zeuxine papillosa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides."
