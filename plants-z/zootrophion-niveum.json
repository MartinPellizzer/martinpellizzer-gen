    "intro": "Zootrophion niveum, commonly known as the snow zootrophion, is a unique plant species native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly foliage that provides insulation against cold temperatures. The plant's leaves are covered in a thick layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to low-light environments. Due to its specialized habitat, Zootrophion niveum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
