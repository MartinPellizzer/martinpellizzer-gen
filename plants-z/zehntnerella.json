It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers, which are typically blue or violet in color. The plants are native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often growing in rocky or calcareous soils. Zehntnerella species are herbaceous perennials, with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions."
