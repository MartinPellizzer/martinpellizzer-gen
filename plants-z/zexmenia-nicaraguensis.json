    "intro": "Zexmenia nicaraguensis, commonly known as the Nicaraguan zexmenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under dense forest canopies. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss, Zexmenia nicaraguensis is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists studying plant biodiversity in the region."
