    "intro": "Zanthoxylum floribundum, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red cedar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties, though it is also subject to overharvesting. Zanthoxylum floribundum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods and thickets."
