It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
