    "intro": "Zornia filifolia var. adenophora, commonly known as the hairy zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to arid environments, helping to reduce water loss."
