    "intro": "Zea mays var. oxyornistunicata, commonly known as the Mexican corn or sweet corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its unique botanical features. It typically exhibits elongated, narrow leaves with a bluish-green hue, and its stalks are sturdy and fibrous. The plant produces tassels at the top, which are used for pollination, and its ears bear kernels that are often sweeter and more tender than those of standard corn varieties. This variety is native to Mexico and is valued for its agricultural and culinary significance. Its genetic diversity contributes to the broader understanding of maize evolution and domestication."
