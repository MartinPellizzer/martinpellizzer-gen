    "intro": "Zanthoxylum clava-herculis subsp. clava-herculis, commonly known as the Hercules clubmoss, is a member of the family Podostomata. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, club-like clusters of spore-bearing structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along streams and in wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it lacks true roots, instead relying on rhizoids for anchorage. This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by providing microhabitats for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
