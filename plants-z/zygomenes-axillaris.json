    "intro": "Zygomenes axillaris, commonly known as the rock fig, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in the leaf axils. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that ripens to a deep red or orange color. Zygomenes axillaris is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in rocky and sandy soils."
