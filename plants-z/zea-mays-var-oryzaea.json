    "intro": "Zea mays var. oryzaea, commonly known as the Mexican corn or teosinte, is a wild relative of modern corn. It is native to Mexico and Central America, where it grows in a variety of habitats, including dry and wet environments. This plant is characterized by its small, spiky ears and narrow leaves, which differ significantly from the domesticated corn we know today. It has a complex genetic structure and is considered a key ancestor in the domestication of maize. Due to its genetic diversity, it plays an important role in agricultural research and conservation efforts."
