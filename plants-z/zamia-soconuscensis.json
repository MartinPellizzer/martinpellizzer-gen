    "intro": "Zamia soconuscensis, commonly known as the Soconusco cycad, is a rare cycad species native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of long, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
