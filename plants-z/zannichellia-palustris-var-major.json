    "intro": "Zannichellia palustris var. major, commonly known as the greater marsh pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which emerge above the water surface during the summer months. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish. Zannichellia palustris var. major is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and improve water quality."
