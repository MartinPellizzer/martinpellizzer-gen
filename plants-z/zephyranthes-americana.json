    "intro": "Zephyranthes americana, commonly known as the rain lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Central America. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces showy, white or pale pink flowers during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its bulbs are underground and allow it to survive periods of drought. The flowers are often short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
