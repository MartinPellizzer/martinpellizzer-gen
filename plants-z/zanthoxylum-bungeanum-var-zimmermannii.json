    "intro": "Zanthoxylum bungeanum var. zimmermannii, commonly known as Sichuan pepper, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnately arranged, with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a resinous scent. The plant is valued for its fruit, which is used in traditional Chinese cuisine and herbal medicine for its pungent and numbing flavor."
