    "intro": "Zanthoxylum suberosum, commonly known as the roughleaf prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Zanthoxylum suberosum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
