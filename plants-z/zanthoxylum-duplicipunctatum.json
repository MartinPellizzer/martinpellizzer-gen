    "intro": "Zanthoxylum duplicipunctatum, commonly known as the two-spined prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes other citrus and related plants. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. Its fruit is a red, fleshy drupe that contains several seeds, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's thorny stems and aromatic foliage make it a distinctive and somewhat challenging species to handle."
