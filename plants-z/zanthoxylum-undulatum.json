    "intro": "Zanthoxylum undulatum, commonly known as the Mexican prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a sharp, spicy flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Zanthoxylum undulatum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
