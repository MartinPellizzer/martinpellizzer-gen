    "intro": "Zanthoxylum glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Zanthoxylum glomeratum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
