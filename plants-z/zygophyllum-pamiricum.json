    "intro": "Zygophyllum pamiricum, commonly known as the Pamir sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well-adapted to high altitudes and extreme temperatures. Due to its resilience, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
