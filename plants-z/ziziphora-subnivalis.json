    "intro": "Ziziphora subnivalis, commonly known as the snow ziziphora, is a perennial herb native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and aromatic, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Ziziphora subnivalis is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky soils at elevations above 2,500 meters."
