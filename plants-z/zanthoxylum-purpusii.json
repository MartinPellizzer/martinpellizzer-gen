    "intro": "Zanthoxylum purpusii, commonly known as the Mexican prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a spicy, peppery flavor due to the presence of alkaloids. Zanthoxylum purpusii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species that thrives in well-drained soils. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological and horticultural study."
