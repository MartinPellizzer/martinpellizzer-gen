    "intro": "Zanthoxylum ciliatum, commonly known as the prickly ash or American prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and small mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. Its bark and twigs contain compounds used in traditional medicine for their analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Zanthoxylum ciliatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
