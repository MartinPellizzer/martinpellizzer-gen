    "intro": "Zamia splendens, commonly known as the golden cycad, is a species of cycad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are usually bright green. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are enclosed in a fleshy, red covering. Zamia splendens is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and bright, indirect light. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique and attractive appearance."
