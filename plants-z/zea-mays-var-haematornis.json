    "intro": "Zea mays var. haematornis, commonly known as the red corn or blood corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its distinctive reddish tassels and kernels. This plant is native to the Americas and is typically cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant coloration. The leaves are broad and pointed, with a grass-like texture, while the stalks are sturdy and often used in traditional crafts. Its flowers are monoecious, meaning both male and female flowers are present on the same plant, and it relies on wind pollination. The plant's botanical features make it a unique addition to gardens and a subject of interest in both horticulture and botany."
