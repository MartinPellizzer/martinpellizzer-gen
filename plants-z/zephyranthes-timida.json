    "intro": "Zephyranthes timida, commonly known as the timid rain lily, is a species of flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and delicate, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in response to rainfall, often during the rainy season, hence its common name. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink and are borne on slender stems. Zephyranthes timida is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges."
