The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, pea-like flowers that are often pink or purple in color. Zornia ramosa is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
