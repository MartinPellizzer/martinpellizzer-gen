    "intro": "Zanthoxylum conspersipunctatum, commonly known as the spiny chinaberry, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its compound leaves and yellowish-orange flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically orange or red when mature, containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive in non-native regions."
