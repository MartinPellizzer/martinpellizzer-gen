    "intro": "Zizania caduciflora, commonly known as the slough grass or yellow bulrush, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces fluffy, yellowish flowers that appear in late summer, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively in wetland environments. Zizania caduciflora is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
