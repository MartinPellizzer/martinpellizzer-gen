    "intro": "Zanthoxylum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf prickly ash, is a small shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in whorls and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine. Zanthoxylum pumilum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland environments."
