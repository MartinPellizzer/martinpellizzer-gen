    "intro": "Zerna pumpelliana subsp. vogulica, commonly known as the Vogulian zerna, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
