    "intro": "Zygophyllum compressum, commonly known as the flatleaf sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Zygophyllum compressum is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
