    "intro": "Zephyranthes moelleri, commonly known as the rain lily, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom after rainfall. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It has strap-like, grassy leaves and produces small, bulbous rhizomes that help it survive in dry periods. Zephyranthes moelleri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in garden settings."
