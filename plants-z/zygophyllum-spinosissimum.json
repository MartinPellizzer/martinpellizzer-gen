    "intro": "Zygophyllum spinosissimum, commonly known as the spiny zygophyllum, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow or red flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Zygophyllum spinosissimum is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in desert environments."
