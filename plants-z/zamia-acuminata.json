    "intro": "Zamia acuminata, commonly known as the spiny cycad, is a perennial plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Zamia acuminata is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
