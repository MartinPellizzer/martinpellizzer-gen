    "intro": "Zanthoxylum lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 4 to 8 inches long and composed of 5 to 11 ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its bark and leaves contain alkaloids and are used in traditional medicine for their stimulant and analgesic properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
