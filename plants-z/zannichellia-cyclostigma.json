    "intro": "Zannichellia cyclostigma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in the summer. Zannichellia cyclostigma is often found in still or slow-flowing water, where it can anchor itself to muddy or sandy substrates. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
