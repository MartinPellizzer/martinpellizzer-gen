It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers, which are typically borne on long, pendulous stems. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged in a fan-like pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Zygopetalum xanthinum thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
