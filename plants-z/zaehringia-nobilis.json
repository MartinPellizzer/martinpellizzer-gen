    "intro": "Zaehringia nobilis, commonly known as the noble zaehringia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Zaehringia nobilis is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
