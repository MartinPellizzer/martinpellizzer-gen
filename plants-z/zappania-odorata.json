It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in vibrant shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it thrives in warm, moist climates with high humidity. Zappania odorata is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its subtle, sweet fragrance that lingers in the air."
