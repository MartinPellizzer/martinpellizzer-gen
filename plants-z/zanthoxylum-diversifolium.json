    "intro": "Zanthoxylum diversifolium, commonly known as the variable-leaf prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which vary in shape and size across different parts of the plant, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used traditionally for medicinal purposes. Zanthoxylum diversifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
