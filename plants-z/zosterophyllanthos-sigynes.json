    "intro": "Zosterophyllanthos sigynes, commonly known as the coastal zosterophyllum, is a unique marine plant belonging to the order Zosterophyllales. It is characterized by its filamentous structure, which consists of branching, ribbon-like fronds that grow in dense clusters. The plant lacks true roots and leaves, instead relying on its fronds for both photosynthesis and anchoring. It is typically found in intertidal zones, where it thrives in shallow, saline waters. Zosterophyllanthos sigynes plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms."
