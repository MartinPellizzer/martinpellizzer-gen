    "intro": "Zanthoxylum rhoifolium var. sessilifolium, commonly known as the sessile-leaf prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 4 to 6 inches long and consist of 5 to 7 pairs of ovate, sessile leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant fall color and unique foliage structure."
