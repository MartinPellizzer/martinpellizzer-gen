    "intro": "Zanthoxylum pilosulum, commonly known as the hairy prickly ash, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 4 to 8 inches long and have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Zanthoxylum pilosulum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
