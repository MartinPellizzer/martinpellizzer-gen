    "intro": "Zingiber pseudosquarrosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ginger, is a rhizomatous herb native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other economically important plants like ginger and turmeric. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in its humid habitat. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The rhizomes of Zingiber pseudosquarrosum are used in traditional medicine and are believed to have anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
