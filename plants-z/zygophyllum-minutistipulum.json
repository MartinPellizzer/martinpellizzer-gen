    "intro": "Zygophyllum minutistipulum, commonly known as the small-tipped sandmat, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae, characterized by its small, often succulent leaves and distinctive, clustered flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, featuring deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals and stamens that are often hairy. Zygophyllum minutistipulum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert animals."
