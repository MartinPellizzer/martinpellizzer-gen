    "intro": "Zerna paulsenii subsp. angrenica, commonly known as the Angrenic zerna, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Central Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for survival in nutrient-poor soils and harsh climatic conditions. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental degradation and habitat loss."
