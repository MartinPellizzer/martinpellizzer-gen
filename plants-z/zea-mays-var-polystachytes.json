    "intro": "Zea mays var. polystachytes, commonly known as the Mexican maize or teosinte, is a wild relative of modern corn. It is characterized by its tall, branching stalks and small, clustered ears of grain. The plant typically grows in warm, tropical climates and has narrow, elongated leaves. Its genetic diversity is significant, contributing to the domestication of maize. It plays an important role in agricultural research and the study of plant evolution."
