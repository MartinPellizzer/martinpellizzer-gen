    "intro": "Zamia linearifolia, commonly known as the linear-leaf cycad, is a slow-growing, evergreen plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of long, narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often appreciated as a decorative plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
