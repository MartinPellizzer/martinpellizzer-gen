It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, often with five petals. Zanonia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields."
