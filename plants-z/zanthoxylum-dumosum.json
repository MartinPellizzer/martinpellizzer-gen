    "intro": "Zanthoxylum dumosum, commonly known as the bush prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. Zanthoxylum dumosum is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in woodland edges. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native habitat."
