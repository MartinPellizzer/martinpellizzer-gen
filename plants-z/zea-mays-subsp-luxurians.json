    "intro": "Zea mays subsp. luxurians, commonly known as the Mexican corn or luxuriant maize, is a subspecies of maize native to Central America. It is characterized by its tall stature, often reaching heights of up to 4 meters, and its large, broad leaves. The plant produces tassels at the top of the stalk, which are used for pollination, and ears of grain that are typically larger and more robust than those of common corn. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This subspecies is valued for its genetic diversity and is sometimes used in breeding programs to improve the resilience of modern corn varieties."
