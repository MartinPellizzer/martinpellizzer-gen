It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife but considered toxic to humans. Its bark and leaves contain compounds used in traditional medicine for their stimulant and analgesic properties."
