    "intro": "Ziziphora capitata, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It features aromatic, finely divided leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in umbel-like clusters. The plant is characterized by its strong, licorice-like fragrance, which comes from its volatile oils. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. Ziziphora capitata is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in herbal medicine."
