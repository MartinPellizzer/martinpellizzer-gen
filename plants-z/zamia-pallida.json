    "intro": "Zamia pallida, commonly known as the white zamia, is a cycad-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, woody stem and a rosette of long, strap-like leaves that are typically light green to pale yellow. The plant produces a cone-like structure called a strobilus, which contains the seeds. Zamia pallida is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. It is considered a slow-growing plant with a long lifespan, often reaching maturity over several decades."
