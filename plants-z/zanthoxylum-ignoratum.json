    "intro": "Zanthoxylum ignoratum, commonly known as the Chinese prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Zanthoxylum ignoratum is part of the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is known for its aromatic, often spicy scent. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
