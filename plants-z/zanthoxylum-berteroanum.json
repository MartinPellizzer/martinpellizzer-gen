    "intro": "Zanthoxylum berteroanum, commonly known as the yellow prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally considered toxic to humans. Its bark and leaves contain compounds such as lignans and alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Zanthoxylum berteroanum is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
