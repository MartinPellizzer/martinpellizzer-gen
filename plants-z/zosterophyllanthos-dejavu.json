It belongs to the family Zosterophyllaceae and is notable for its primitive morphology, resembling early land plants. The plant exhibits a distinct structure with a root-like base and a branching, fern-like stem system. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its evolutionary significance lies in its potential to provide insights into the transition of plants from aquatic to terrestrial life."
