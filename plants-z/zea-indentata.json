    "intro": "Zea indentata, commonly known as the wild maize or teosinte, is a grass species native to the Americas. It is a close relative of modern corn and has a distinctive appearance with narrow, ridged leaves and compact, tassel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in hard, dry fruits and are often used in traditional agricultural practices. Zea indentata plays a significant role in the genetic diversity of maize and is studied for its potential in crop improvement."
