    "intro": "Zanthoxylum clava-herculis, commonly known as the Hercules club or prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds and wildlife. It thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, and its bark and leaves have been used historically in traditional medicine. The plant's name reflects its robust growth and historical association with strength and endurance."
