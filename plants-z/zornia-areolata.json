    "intro": "Zornia areolata, commonly known as the punctuated zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, palmate leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that splits open when mature. Zornia areolata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats."
