    "intro": "Zygopetalum expansum, commonly known as the broad-leafed zygopetalum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink, with a distinctive lip that is often broader than the rest of the flower. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage consists of broad, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Zygopetalum expansum is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
