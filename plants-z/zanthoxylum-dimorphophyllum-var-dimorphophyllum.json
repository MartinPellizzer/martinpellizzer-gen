    "intro": "Zanthoxylum dimorphophyllum var. dimorphophyllum, commonly known as the two-leaved prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have two distinct leaflets, giving it its species name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife. Its bark is rough and fissured, often exuding a strong, aromatic resin. The plant is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun."
