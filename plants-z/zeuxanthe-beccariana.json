    "intro": "Zeuxanthe beccariana, commonly known as the Beccarian's sea fan, is a species of gorgonian coral found in tropical marine environments. It is characterized by its branching, fan-like structure composed of calcium carbonate, which provides a habitat for various marine organisms. The coral exhibits a symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae algae, which contribute to its vibrant coloration through photosynthesis. It thrives in shallow, warm waters with good light penetration, often found in the Indo-Pacific region. Due to its ecological importance and aesthetic appeal, it is a subject of interest in marine biology and reef conservation efforts."
