It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like ginger and turmeric. The plant is characterized by its glossy, silver-green leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though it is less commonly cultivated than other ginger species. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
