    "intro": "Zephyranthes uruguaianica, commonly known as the Uruguay starflower, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Argentina. It is a bulbous plant that produces striking, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to dry conditions and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Zephyranthes uruguaianica is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
