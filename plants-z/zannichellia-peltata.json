    "intro": "Zannichellia peltata, commonly known as the broad-leaved water starwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and Asia. It has elongated, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are borne on long, slender stalks, which emerge from the water surface. Zannichellia peltata thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its presence is an indicator of good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
