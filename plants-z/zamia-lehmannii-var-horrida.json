    "intro": "Zamia lehmannii var. horrida, commonly known as the Horrid Zamia, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a cycad-like plant characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically dark green, leathery, and have a distinctive, spiny appearance. It produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. This species is notable for its slow growth and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
