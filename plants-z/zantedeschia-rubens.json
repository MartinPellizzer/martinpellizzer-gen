    "intro": "Zantedeschia rubens, commonly known as the red calla lily, is a striking ornamental plant native to southern Africa. It features arrow-shaped, glossy green leaves and dramatic, white to pale pink spatulate flowers with a prominent yellow spadix. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for water gardens and shaded borders. It is often cultivated for its elegant appearance and ability to bloom reliably in cooler climates. Zantedeschia rubens is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and can be grown in containers or as part of a perennial garden."
