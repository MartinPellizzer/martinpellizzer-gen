    "intro": "Zygostates cornuta, commonly known as the horned zygostate, is a unique member of the Zygostomata family. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, horn-like structures that extend from its body, which are believed to play a role in defense or display. The plant has a simple, branching structure with small, scale-like leaves that are typically green in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Zygostates cornuta is considered a delicate and less-studied botanical specimen."
