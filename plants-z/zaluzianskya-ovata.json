    "intro": "Zaluzianskya ovata, commonly known as the broadleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and showy, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds. Botanically, it belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. Its structure and morphology reflect adaptations to its native arid and semi-arid environments."
