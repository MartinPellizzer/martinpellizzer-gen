    "intro": "Zygophyllum hirticaule, commonly known as the hairy zygophyllum, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, pale green or yellowish leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Zygophyllum hirticaule is often found in rocky soils and is considered an important component of desert ecosystems."
