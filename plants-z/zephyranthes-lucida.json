It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and is known for its delicate, star-shaped white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist, sandy soils. It produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and blooms in late summer to early fall. Zephyranthes lucida is a short-lived perennial, often flowering and setting seed within a single growing season."
