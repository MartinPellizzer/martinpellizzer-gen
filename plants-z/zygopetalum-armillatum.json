    "intro": "Zygopetalum armillatum, commonly known as the orchid with the ringed lip, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that feature a prominent, ring-like structure on the lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Zygopetalum armillatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique floral display."
