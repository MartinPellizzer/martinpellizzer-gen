    "intro": "Zaluzania pinnatilobata, commonly known as the broadleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically deeply divided. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flower heads in the late summer and early fall, which are clustered in panicles. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Zaluzania pinnatilobata is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in meadows and woodland edges."
