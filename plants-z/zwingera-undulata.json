    "intro": "Zwingera undulata, commonly known as the wavy zwingera, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle beauty to its natural habitat. Zwingera undulata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
