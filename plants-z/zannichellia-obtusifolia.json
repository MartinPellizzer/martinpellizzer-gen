    "intro": "Zannichellia obtusifolia, commonly known as broadleaf water starwort, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a waxy surface that helps it remain buoyant. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming from June to August. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize sediment in water bodies, contributing to water clarity. Zannichellia obtusifolia is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches."
