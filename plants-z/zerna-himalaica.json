It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its ecological importance and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
