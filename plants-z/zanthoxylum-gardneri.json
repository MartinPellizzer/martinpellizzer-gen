    "intro": "Zanthoxylum gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red berries that are edible for some wildlife but contain seeds with a spicy, peppery flavor. Its thorny stems and aromatic foliage make it a distinctive member of the Zanthoxylum genus. Zanthoxylum gardneri thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and riverbanks."
