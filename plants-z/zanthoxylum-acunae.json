    "intro": "Zanthoxylum acunae, commonly known as the Mexican prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife but contain irritants that can cause skin reactions in humans. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
