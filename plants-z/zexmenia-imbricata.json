    "intro": "Zexmenia imbricata, commonly known as the rock fig, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are usually small and opposite. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh environments. The fruit, when mature, is a small, fleshy berry that may be edible and attracts various wildlife."
