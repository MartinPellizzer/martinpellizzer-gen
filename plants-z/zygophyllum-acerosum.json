    "intro": "Zygophyllum acerosum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Zygophyllum acerosum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its resilience in extreme climates."
