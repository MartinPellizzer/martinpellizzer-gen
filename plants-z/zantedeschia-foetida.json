    "intro": "Zantedeschia foetida, commonly known as the stink lily, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in full bloom."
