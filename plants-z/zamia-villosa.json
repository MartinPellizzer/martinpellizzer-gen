    "intro": "Zamia villosa, commonly known as the hairy cycad, is a tropical plant native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, tropical environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular ornamental plant in cultivation."
