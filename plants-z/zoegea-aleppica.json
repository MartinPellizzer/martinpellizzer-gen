    "intro": "Zoegea aleppica, commonly known as the Aleppo zoegea, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Zoegea aleppica is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in local medicine."
