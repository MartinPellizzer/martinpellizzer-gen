    "intro": "Zea mays var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated corn. This variant of maize is characterized by its striking color patterns, featuring patches of white, yellow, and green on its leaves and tassels. It is a cultivar that exhibits genetic mutations leading to the variegation, which is often a result of chlorophyll deficiency in certain parts of the plant. While it is not typically used for grain production, it is popular in ornamental gardening and as a specimen plant. Its unique appearance makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticultural displays."
