    "intro": "Zehneria alba, commonly known as the white zehneria, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking white flowers with a subtle pinkish tinge. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually ovate and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Zehneria alba is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
