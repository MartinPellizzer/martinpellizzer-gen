    "intro": "Zygia cauliflora, commonly known as the mountain zygia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique cauliflorous growth habit, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the stems rather than at the tips of branches. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Zygia cauliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its distinctive appearance."
