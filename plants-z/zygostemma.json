    "intro": "Zygostemma, commonly known as the Chinese milkvetch, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Asia, particularly China and Southeast Asia. These plants are typically shrubs or herbs with compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. Zygostemma species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their deep root systems. Some species have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
