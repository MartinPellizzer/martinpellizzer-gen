    "intro": "Zigadenus venenosus var. ambiguus, commonly known as the toxic lily or death lily, is a member of the Melanthiaceae family. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. Its most notable characteristic is the presence of toxic alkaloids, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in gardens and requires caution during identification and handling."
