    "intro": "Zinnia zamudiana, commonly known as the desert zinnia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is adapted to thrive in hot, dry conditions with minimal water requirements. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Zinnia zamudiana is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
