    "intro": "Zigadenus exaltatus, commonly known as death cup, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a toxic sap that contains several cardiac glycosides, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. Zigadenus exaltatus typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its toxic properties have earned it a reputation as one of the most dangerous plants in its native range."
