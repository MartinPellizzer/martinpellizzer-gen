    "intro": "Zygia palustris, commonly known as the swamp zygia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. Zygia palustris is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity in wetland ecosystems. Its botanical characteristics make it an important indicator species for healthy aquatic environments."
