    "intro": "Zieria exsul, commonly known as the slender zieria, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in coastal heathlands. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight blue or silver hue, and it produces capsule fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Zieria exsul is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
