    "intro": "Zerna pumpelliana subsp. arctica, commonly known as Arctic zerna, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its cold environment. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is an important part of the local flora."
