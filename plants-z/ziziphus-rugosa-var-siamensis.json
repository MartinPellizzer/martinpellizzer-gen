    "intro": "Ziziphus rugosa var. siamensis, commonly known as the Siam date tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that resemble dates, which are typically consumed fresh or dried. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry, sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for ornamental purposes."
