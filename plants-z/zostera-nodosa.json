    "intro": "Zostera nodosa, commonly known as the nodose eelgrass, is a marine flowering plant found in shallow coastal waters. It has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically bright green and arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by water, a process known as hydrophily. Its roots form dense underwater meadows that provide critical habitat for various marine species. Zostera nodosa plays an important role in stabilizing sediments and improving water quality in coastal ecosystems."
