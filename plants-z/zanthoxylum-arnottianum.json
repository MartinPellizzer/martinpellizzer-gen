    "intro": "Zanthoxylum arnottianum, commonly known as the black haw, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 4 to 10 inches long and composed of 5 to 11 pairs of ovate to lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are a notable feature of its botanical profile. Its bark is rough and fissured, often exuding a pungent, aromatic resin. Zanthoxylum arnottianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
