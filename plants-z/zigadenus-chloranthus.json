    "intro": "Zigadenus chloranthus, commonly known as the yellow death cup, is a striking plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white berries that are highly toxic. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush habitats. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens."
