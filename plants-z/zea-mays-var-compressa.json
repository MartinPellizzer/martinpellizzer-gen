    "intro": "Zea mays var. compressa, commonly known as the compact corn or dwarf corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its shorter stature and tightly compacted ears. It is a member of the grass family, Poaceae, and is native to the Americas, particularly Mexico. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with leaves that are narrower and more upright compared to standard corn. Its ears are smaller and more densely packed with kernels, making it a unique and ornamental variety. This variant is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is also used in some traditional agricultural practices."
