    "intro": "Zieria citriodora, commonly known as lemon myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves that contain high levels of citral, a compound responsible for its distinctive fragrance. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue or black berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Zieria citriodora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the essential oils extracted from its leaves."
