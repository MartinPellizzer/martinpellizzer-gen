    "intro": "Zaga parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved zaga, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
