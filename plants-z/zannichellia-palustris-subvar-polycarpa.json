    "intro": "Zannichellia palustris subvar. polycarpa, commonly known as the marsh stellaria, is a aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters. It has small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it produces numerous small, elliptical fruits. The plant has ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish. This subspecies is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from the water."
