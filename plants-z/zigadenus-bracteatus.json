    "intro": "Zigadenus bracteatus, commonly known as the bracted death camis, is a toxic plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Melanthiaceae family and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which can be misleading as it is highly poisonous. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, and it contains toxic alkaloids that can be lethal to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is important to avoid contact with any part of the plant."
