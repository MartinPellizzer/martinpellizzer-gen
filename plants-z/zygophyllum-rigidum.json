    "intro": "Zygophyllum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid glassworts, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers during the cooler months, typically from spring to early summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Zygophyllum rigidum plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert animals."
