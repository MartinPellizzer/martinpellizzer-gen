    "intro": "Zanthoxylum serrulatum, commonly known as the prickly ash or toothbrush tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnately arranged, with serrated margins that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Its bark and leaves contain compounds used in traditional medicine, and the plant is often found in moist, wooded areas. Zanthoxylum serrulatum is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
