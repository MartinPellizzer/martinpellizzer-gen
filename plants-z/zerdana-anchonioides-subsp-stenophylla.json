    "intro": "Zerdana anchonioides subsp. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf zerdana, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, aromatic foliage. It is native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean, particularly in areas of Turkey and northern Syria. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
