It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other economically important plants like turmeric and ginger. The plant features a rhizomatous root system and produces striking, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. Its inflorescence consists of vibrant, colorful flowers that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine.
