    "intro": "Zauschneria latifolia var. viscosa, commonly known as the sticky leaf goldbloom, is a perennial herb native to coastal areas of California and southern Oregon. It is characterized by its showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky resin, which gives it its common name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This species is often found in open habitats such as dunes, cliffs, and coastal scrub."
