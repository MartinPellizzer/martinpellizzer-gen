    "intro": "Zea praecox, commonly known as early maize, is a wild relative of modern corn. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has narrow, blade-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a tassel-like structure at the top, which produces pollen, and a panicle of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Zea praecox is characterized by its small, two-lobed grains that are enclosed in a lemma and palea."
