It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater. Zygophyllum pterocarpum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
