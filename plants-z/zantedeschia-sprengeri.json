It features large, white, spatulate leaves and showy, funnel-shaped flowers that resemble calla lilies. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with its rhizomatous root system allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Zantedeschia sprengeri prefers partial shade to full sun and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for water gardens and boggy areas."
