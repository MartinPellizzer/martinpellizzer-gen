    "intro": "Zieria tuberculata, commonly known as the rough-leaved zieria, is a small shrub native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine, tuberculate bumps. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are aromatic and have a distinctive, slightly resinous scent when crushed. Zieria tuberculata is often found in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade."
