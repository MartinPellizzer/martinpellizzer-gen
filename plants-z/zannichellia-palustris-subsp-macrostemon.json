    "intro": "Zannichellia palustris subsp. macrostemon, commonly known as the broad-stemmed water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are usually submerged, with the upper part often floating on the water surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in dense clusters and are pollinated by insects. Zannichellia palustris subsp. macrostemon plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
