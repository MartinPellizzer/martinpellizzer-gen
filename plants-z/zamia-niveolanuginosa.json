    "intro": "Zamia niveolanuginosa, commonly known as the white-flowered cycad, is a species of cycad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, white, spathate flowers that are clustered at the base of the stem. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
