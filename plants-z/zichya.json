    "intro": "Zichya, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, often reaching heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. Zichya thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ability to bloom continuously makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
