    "intro": "Zornia muriculata subsp. muriculata, commonly known as the rough zornia, is a low-growing annual herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and features simple, alternate leaves that are usually hairy and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seed pods are distinctive, being hairy and inflated, which aid in wind dispersal. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
