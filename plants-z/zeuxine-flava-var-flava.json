It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape."
