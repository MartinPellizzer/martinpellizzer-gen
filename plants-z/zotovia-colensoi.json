    "intro": "Zotovia colensoi, commonly known as the Colenso's zotovia, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology and fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils at high altitudes, where it exhibits adaptations to harsh climatic conditions. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are followed by orange fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zotovia colensoi is considered a species of conservation concern."
