    "intro": "Zygophyllum geslinii, commonly known as the desert fanflower, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Zygophyllum geslinii is well adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
