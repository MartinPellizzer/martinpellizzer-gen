    "intro": "Zingiber gracile var. elatius, commonly known as the slender ginger or narrow-leafed ginger, is a species native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike. The plant's leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth, waxy texture. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a mild, spicy aroma similar to other ginger species. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
