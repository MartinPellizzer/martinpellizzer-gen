    "intro": "Zornia brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed zornia, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Zornia brevipes is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils."
