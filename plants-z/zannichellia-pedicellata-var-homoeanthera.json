    "intro": "Zannichellia pedicellata var. homoeanthera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water violet, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with some floating on the water surface. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive structure that includes a single stamen. This variety is characterized by its reduced anthers, which are fused to the petals, giving it a unique floral morphology."
