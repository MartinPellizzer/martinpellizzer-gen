It is characterized by its large, white, nocturnal blooms that open at night and close by morning. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves and has a climbing habit, often found in shaded, humid environments. Its flowers emit a fragrant scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Zarabellia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique blooming pattern."
