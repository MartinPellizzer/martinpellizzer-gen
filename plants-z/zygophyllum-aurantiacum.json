    "intro": "Zygophyllum aurantiacum, commonly known as the red sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb with small, fleshy, spine-tipped leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water. Zygophyllum aurantiacum plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
