    "intro": "Zauschneria arizonica, commonly known as Arizona poppy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bright orange to red flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. The Arizona poppy is also known for its ability to thrive in full sun and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
