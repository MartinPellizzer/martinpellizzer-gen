    "intro": "Zigadenus paniculatus, commonly known as the western poison root, is a toxic plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features clusters of small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a panicle, which is its distinguishing characteristic. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, and the stems are usually hairy. All parts of the plant contain toxic alkaloids, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals."
