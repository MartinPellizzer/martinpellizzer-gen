    "intro": "Zamia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to parts of Central and South America. It is a cycad, characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often with a waxy texture, and it is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates. Zamia angustifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also studied for its ecological and evolutionary significance."
