    "intro": "Zieria parrisiae, commonly known as the narrow-leaf zieria, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the eastern regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Zieria parrisiae typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and conservation efforts in its native habitat."
