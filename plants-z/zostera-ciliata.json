    "intro": "Zostera ciliata, commonly known as the common eelgrass, is a marine flowering plant that thrives in shallow coastal waters. It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically green and strap-shaped. This plant plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Zostera ciliata is often found in seagrass beds, contributing to coastal biodiversity and sediment stabilization. It is also important for carbon sequestration and supporting commercial fisheries."
