    "intro": "Zornia elegans, commonly known as the elegant zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Zornia elegans is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
