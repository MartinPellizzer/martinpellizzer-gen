    "intro": "Zanthoxylum oblongum, commonly known as the Chinese prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and mammals. Zanthoxylum oblongum is known for its aromatic, pungent fragrance, which is due to the presence of volatile oils in its leaves and bark. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
