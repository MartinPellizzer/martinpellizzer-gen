    "intro": "Zamia nana, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a species native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its compact size and unique, palm-like appearance. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a fibrous, spongy texture, and it produces cycad-like cones rather than flowers. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. Zamia nana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and slow growth rate."
