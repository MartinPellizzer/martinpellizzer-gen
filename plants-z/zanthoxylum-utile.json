    "intro": "Zanthoxylum utile, commonly known as the prickly ash or yellow prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often mistaken for those of the related species Zanthoxylum clava-herculis. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to red, berry-like fruits, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its bark and twigs contain compounds used in traditional medicine for their stimulant and analgesic properties."
