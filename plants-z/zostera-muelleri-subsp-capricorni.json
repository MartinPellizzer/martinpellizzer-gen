    "intro": "Zostera muelleri subsp. capricorni, commonly known as the Capricorn seagrass, is a marine flowering plant belonging to the family Zosteraceae. It is characterized by its ribbon-like, blade-shaped leaves that are typically green in color and adapted for underwater life. This species thrives in shallow coastal waters, often forming dense underwater meadows that provide habitat for various marine organisms. Its rhizomes anchor it to the seafloor, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically found in submerged environments. Zostera muelleri subsp. capricorni plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and supporting biodiversity."
