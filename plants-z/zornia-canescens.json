    "intro": "Zornia canescens, commonly known as the hairy zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, showy pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Zornia canescens is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
