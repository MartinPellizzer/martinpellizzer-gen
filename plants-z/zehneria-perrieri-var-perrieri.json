    "intro": "Zehneria perrieri var. perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's zehneria, is a rare and striking member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from deep pink to violet, often with intricate patterns. Its foliage consists of glossy, ovate leaves that are typically a deep green. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
