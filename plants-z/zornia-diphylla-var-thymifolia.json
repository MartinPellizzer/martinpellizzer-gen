    "intro": "Zornia diphylla var. thymifolia, commonly known as the thyme-leaved zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers, which are typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. The species is notable for its aromatic foliage, which resembles the scent of thyme, hence its common name."
