    "intro": "Zephyranthes rosalensis, commonly known as the Rosalense rain lily, is a small, flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in response to rainfall. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base, and it is often found in shaded or semi-shaded habitats. Zephyranthes rosalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fleeting but striking floral display."
