    "intro": "Zamia neurophyllidia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones rather than flowers. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk with a crown of pinnate leaves that are narrow and strap-like. Its foliage is evergreen, and it thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun exposure. Zamia neurophyllidia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in traditional medicine."
