    "intro": "Zygophyllum neglectum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing, perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has small, fleshy, yellowish-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Zygophyllum neglectum is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
