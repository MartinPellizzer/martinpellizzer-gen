    "intro": "Ziziphus colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian date palm, is a small, evergreen tree native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to dates, though they are typically smaller and less sweet. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry, rocky soils. Ziziphus colombiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological benefits."
