    "intro": "Zygophyllum ovigerum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its low-growing habit, gray-green foliage, and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through features such as succulent leaves and deep root systems that help conserve water. Its flowers are typically pollinated by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Zygophyllum ovigerum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
