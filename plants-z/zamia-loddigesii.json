    "intro": "Zamia loddigesii, commonly known as the Loddiges' cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a dioecious plant, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate plants. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that are typically dark green and can grow up to several feet in length. Its cones, which are the reproductive structures, are either male or female and are often used in horticultural collections. Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is a popular specimen in botanical gardens and conservatories."
