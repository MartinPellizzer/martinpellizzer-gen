    "intro": "Zanthoxylum rigidum, commonly known as the prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in small, stiff spines. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it has a distinctive, aromatic scent. Zanthoxylum rigidum is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
