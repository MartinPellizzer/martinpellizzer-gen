    "intro": "Zanthoxylum torreyi, commonly known as the Torrey prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 inches long and consist of 5 to 9 pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife species. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Zanthoxylum torreyi is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes."
