    "intro": "Zootrophion oblongifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf zootrophion, is a unique species of flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery hair, which helps in reflecting sunlight and reducing water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the wet season. Zootrophion oblongifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
