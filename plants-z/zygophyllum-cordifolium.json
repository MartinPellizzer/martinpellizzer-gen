    "intro": "Zygophyllum cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved zygophyllum, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Zygophyllum cordifolium is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
