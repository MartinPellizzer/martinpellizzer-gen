    "intro": "Zornia inermis, commonly known as slender zornia, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It typically features slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Zornia inermis is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical structure reflects its role as a pioneer species in ecological succession."
