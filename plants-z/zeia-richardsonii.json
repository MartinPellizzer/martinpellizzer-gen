    "intro": "Zeia richardsonii, commonly known as the Richardson's zea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of grasses. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zeia richardsonii is considered a sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystems."
