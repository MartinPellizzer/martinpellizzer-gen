    "intro": "Zehneria idenburgensis, commonly known as the Idenburg's zehneria, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zehneria idenburgensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
