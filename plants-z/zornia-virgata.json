    "intro": "Zornia virgata, commonly known as the Virginia zornia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Zornia virgata is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria."
