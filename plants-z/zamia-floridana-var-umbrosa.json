    "intro": "Zamia floridana var. umbrosa, commonly known as the Florida cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its cycad-like appearance, with a stout, unbranched stem and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
