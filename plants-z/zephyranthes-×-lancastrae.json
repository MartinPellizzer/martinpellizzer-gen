    "intro": "Zephyranthes \u00d7 lancastrae, commonly known as the pink rain lily, is a hybrid bulbous plant native to Central America. It produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, typically during the summer months. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and return year after year."
