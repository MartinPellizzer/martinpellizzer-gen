    "intro": "Zieria hydroscopica, commonly known as the water-catching zieria, is a small shrub native to the wetter regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, glossy, evergreen leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, hairy pedicels. Zieria hydroscopica is well adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and forest understories. Its name refers to its ability to \"catch water,\" a trait reflected in its habitat and growth form."
