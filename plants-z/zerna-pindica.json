    "intro": "Zerna pindica, commonly known as mountain millet, is a small annual grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, three-angled spikelets that contain minute seeds. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its seeds are often used as a traditional food source in some regions. Zerna pindica is also valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated for erosion control."
