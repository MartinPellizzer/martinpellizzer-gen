    "intro": "Zanthoxylum ovalifoliolatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to bright red berries, which are edible but have a sharp, spicy flavor. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
