    "intro": "Zerna riparia subsp. fibrosa, commonly known as the fibrous rivergrass, is a perennial herb native to moist, often flood-prone habitats in Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, fibrous stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found along riverbanks and wet meadows. Due to its adaptability to fluctuating water levels, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
