    "intro": "Zygophyllum californicum, commonly known as the California jointfir, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant landscaping."
