    "intro": "Zamia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones rather than flowers. The plant has a stout, woody stem with a crown of feather-like leaves that are often covered in spines. Its leaves are pinnate, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. Zamia spinosa is adapted to grow in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone areas."
