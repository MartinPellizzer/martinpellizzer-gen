It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface. Ziziphora hispida is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its aromatic properties in traditional herbal medicine."
