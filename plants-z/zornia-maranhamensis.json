    "intro": "Zornia maranhamensis, commonly known as the Maranh\u00e3o zornia, is a flowering plant species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are pinnate, with several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in moist, tropical environments. Zornia maranhamensis is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
