    "intro": "Ziziphus lenticellata, commonly known as the smooth ziziphus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Australia, and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and has small, elliptical leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits. Its bark is characterized by shallow, elongated ridges called lenticels, which aid in gas exchange. Ziziphus lenticellata is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
