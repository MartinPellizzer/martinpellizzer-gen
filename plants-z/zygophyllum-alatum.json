    "intro": "Zygophyllum alatum, commonly known as the desert fanflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive fan-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Zygophyllum alatum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
