    "intro": "Zygia cataractae, commonly known as the waterfall zygia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments near waterfalls or along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to habitat destruction, Zygia cataractae is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
