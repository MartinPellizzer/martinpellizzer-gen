    "intro": "Zamia decumbens, commonly known as the creeping cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to parts of Central and South America. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slow growth and unique, palm-like appearance with a stout, woody trunk. The plant produces cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, glossy appearance that helps in photosynthesis. Zamia decumbens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils."
