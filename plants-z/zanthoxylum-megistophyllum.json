    "intro": "Zanthoxylum megistophyllum, commonly known as the giant prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 centimeters long and composed of 7 to 15 pairs of ovate, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. Its bark and leaves contain compounds such as lignans and alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along stream banks."
