    "intro": "Zephyranthes berteroana, commonly known as the rain lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the southern United States and parts of Central and South America. It produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, typically in spring or early summer. The plant has strap-shaped, grass-like leaves that are evergreen in warmer climates and die back in colder regions. Its bulbous structure allows it to store water and nutrients, making it drought-tolerant. Zephyranthes berteroana is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and easy care requirements."
