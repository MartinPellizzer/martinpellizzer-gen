It is characterized by its slender, arching branches and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces distinctive, elongated fruits that are typically 2 to 4 inches long, containing several seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Zilla macrocarpa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands or along streambanks."
