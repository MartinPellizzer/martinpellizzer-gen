    "intro": "Zyrphelis fruticosa, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting yellow or white throat. These flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Zyrphelis fruticosa thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical and subtropical regions."
