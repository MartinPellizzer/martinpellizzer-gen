    "intro": "Zosterophyllanthos cutucuensis, commonly known as the Cutucu zosterophyll, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Zosterophyllaceae and is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Zosterophyllanthos cutucuensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
