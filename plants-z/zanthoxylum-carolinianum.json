    "intro": "Zanthoxylum carolinianum, commonly known as the Carolina prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, oval-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife but considered toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems and a subject of interest in horticulture and ecology."
