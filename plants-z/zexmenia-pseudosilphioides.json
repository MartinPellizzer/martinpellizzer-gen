It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is typically found in wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
