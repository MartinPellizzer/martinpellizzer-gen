    "intro": "Zamia restrepoi, commonly known as the Restrepo cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Colombia. It is a slow-growing plant characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
