    "intro": "Zygia transamazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian zygia, is a rare flowering plant native to the dense rainforests of the Brazilian Amazon. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes trees and shrubs known for their aromatic wood and medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and palmate leaves, which are adapted to the humid, shaded understory of the rainforest. Zygia transamazonica is primarily found in the Transamazonica region, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils and high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
