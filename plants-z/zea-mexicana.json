    "intro": "Zea mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican corn or teosinte, is a wild grass native to Mexico and Central America. It is a member of the Poaceae family and is closely related to modern maize (Zea mays). The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system. Zea mexicana is considered an important ancestor of domesticated corn, with its genetic diversity playing a key role in the development of modern maize varieties."
