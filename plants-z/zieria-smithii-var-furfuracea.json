    "intro": "Zieria smithii var. furfuracea, commonly known as the hairy zieria, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features small, ovate leaves that are densely covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
