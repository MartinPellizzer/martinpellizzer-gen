    "intro": "Zygopetalum patinii, commonly known as the Patin's zygopetalum, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant features long, slender petals and a distinctive, spurred lip that is a key identifier in the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
