    "intro": "Zostera marina var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf eelgrass, is a marine flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically 2\u20136 cm in length. This variant grows in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates in intertidal zones and is often found in estuaries and coastal waters. It plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. Zostera marina var. angustifolia is also important for carbon sequestration and supports biodiversity in coastal ecosystems."
