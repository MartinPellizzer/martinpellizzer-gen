    "intro": "Zexmenia tepuiana, commonly known as the Tepuian zexmenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its leaves are simple, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zexmenia tepuiana is considered a vulnerable species."
