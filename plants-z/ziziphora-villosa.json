    "intro": "Ziziphora villosa, commonly known as woolly ziziphora, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as mint and oregano. The plant is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Ziziphora villosa is often found in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
