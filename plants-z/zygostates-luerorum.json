    "intro": "Zygostates luerorum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a delicate and ornamental plant native to tropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to its substrate. Zygostates luerorum is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
