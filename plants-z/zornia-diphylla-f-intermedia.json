    "intro": "Zornia diphylla f. intermedia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved zornia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive two-leaved morphology, which is reflected in its scientific name. The plant has small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its foliage is narrow and linear, contributing to its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
