    "intro": "Zapoteca sousae, commonly known as the Zapotec mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the highlands of Oaxaca, Mexico. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and gelatinous berries. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily species of the genus Pinus, through its haustoria. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and other wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
