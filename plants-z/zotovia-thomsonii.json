    "intro": "Zotovia thomsonii, commonly known as the Thomson's zotovia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zotovia thomsonii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
