    "intro": "Zoysia iodostachys, commonly known as the coastal zoysia, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its dense, fine-textured foliage and its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or violet, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form thick mats, making it suitable for erosion control in coastal environments. Zoysia iodostachys is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience to coastal conditions."
