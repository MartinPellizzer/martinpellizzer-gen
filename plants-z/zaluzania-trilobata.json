    "intro": "Zaluzania trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces showy, purple to pinkish-red composite flower heads in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist to wet soils in woodland or wetland habitats. Zaluzania trilobata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
