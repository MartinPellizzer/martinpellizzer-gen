    "intro": "Zamia lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's cycad, is a species of cycad native to Mexico. It is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
