    "intro": "Zilla spinosa var. emarginata, commonly known as the emarginate zilla, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, branched stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
