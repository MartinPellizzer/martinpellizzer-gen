    "intro": "Zannichellia contorta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water-cress, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Plantaginaceae. It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are arranged in spikes, and it is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands. Zannichellia contorta is a perennial herb that thrives in nutrient-rich waters and is sometimes used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
