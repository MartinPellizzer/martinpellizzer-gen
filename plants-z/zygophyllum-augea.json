    "intro": "Zygophyllum augea, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss and deep roots that access groundwater. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or sprawling, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Zygophyllum augea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
