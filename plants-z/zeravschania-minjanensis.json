    "intro": "Zeravschania minjanensis, commonly known as the Kashgar poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, fast-growing form and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forest-steppe and mountainous areas. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in parks and gardens."
