    "intro": "Zieria veronicea subsp. insularis, commonly known as the island zieria, is a small shrub native to the island of Tasmania. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in heathlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
