It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
