    "intro": "Zanthoxylum fagara subsp. fagara, commonly known as the prickly ash or red prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some birds and mammals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streambanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant ecosystems."
