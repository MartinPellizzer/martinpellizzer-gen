    "intro": "Ziziphus rotundata, commonly known as the roundleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. Ziziphus rotundata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species with drought tolerance. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
