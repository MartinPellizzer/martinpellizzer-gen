It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, which bloom during the warmer months. It is native to the tropical regions of South and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
