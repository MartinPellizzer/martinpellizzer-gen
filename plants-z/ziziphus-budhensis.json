It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, date-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions, making it well adapted to high-altitude environments.
