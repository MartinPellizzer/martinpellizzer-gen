    "intro": "Zoophora, commonly known as the \"animal plant,\" is a unique species that exhibits characteristics of both plants and animals. It possesses chlorophyll and can perform photosynthesis, allowing it to produce its own food. However, it also displays animal-like behaviors, such as movement and the ability to respond to stimuli. Its structure includes a semi-permeable membrane and a central vacuole, similar to animal cells. This unusual combination of plant and animal traits makes it a fascinating subject in botanical and biological studies."
