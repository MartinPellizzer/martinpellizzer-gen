    "intro": "Zostera americana, commonly known as shoal grass, is a marine flowering plant native to the Atlantic coast of North America. It grows in shallow, coastal waters and forms dense underwater meadows that provide habitat for various marine organisms. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically bright green and can reach lengths of up to 30 inches. It reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, with underwater flowers that are pollinated by water currents. Zostera americana plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and improving water quality in estuarine environments."
