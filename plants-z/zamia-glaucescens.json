    "intro": "Zamia glaucescens, commonly known as the blue zamia, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a cycad-like plant characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its foliage is often a striking blue-green color, which gives it its common name. Zamia glaucescens is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats."
