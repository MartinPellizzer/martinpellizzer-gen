    "intro": "Zanthoxylum rubescens var. dispermum, commonly known as the red prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though it is not widely used in traditional herbal medicine. The species is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
