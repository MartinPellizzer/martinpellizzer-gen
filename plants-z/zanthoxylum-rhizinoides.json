    "intro": "Zanthoxylum rhizinoides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Zanthoxylum rhizinoides is also valued for its durable wood, which has been historically used in construction and crafting."
