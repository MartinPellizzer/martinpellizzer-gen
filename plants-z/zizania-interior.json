    "intro": "Zizania interior, commonly known as the inland spikegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and loose, feathery panicles that produce small, white to pale brown flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source by certain indigenous communities. Zizania interior plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
