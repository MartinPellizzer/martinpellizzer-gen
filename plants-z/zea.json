    "intro": "Zea, commonly known as maize or corn, is a tall annual grass belonging to the Poaceae family. It is native to Mexico and has been cultivated for thousands of years by indigenous peoples. The plant produces large, tassel-like inflorescences at the top of the stalk, which contain both male and female flowers. Zea's ears are covered in rows of kernels, which are the edible part of the plant. It is a staple crop worldwide and plays a significant role in agriculture and food security."
