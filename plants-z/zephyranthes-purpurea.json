    "intro": "Zephyranthes purpurea, commonly known as the pink rain lily, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking pink or purple flowers that bloom in response to rainfall. The plant typically grows from a bulb and produces strap-like, grassy leaves that are evergreen in warmer climates. Its flowers are small, clustered, and often appear in the early spring or after a storm. Zephyranthes purpurea is well adapted to wet environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies."
