    "intro": "Zanthoxylum kleinii, commonly known as the Klein's prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife but contain seeds that are dispersed by animals. Zanthoxylum kleinii thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
