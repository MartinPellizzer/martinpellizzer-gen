    "intro": "Zygophyllum ammophilum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub with fleshy, succulent leaves adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow or pale green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Zygophyllum ammophilum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
