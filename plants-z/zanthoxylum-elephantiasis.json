    "intro": "Zanthoxylum elephantiasis, commonly known as the giant prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, rough, spiny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that attract birds and other wildlife. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with historical uses in traditional medicine, though it is not widely cultivated today. The species is adapted to moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade."
