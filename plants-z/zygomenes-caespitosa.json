    "intro": "Zygomenes caespitosa, commonly known as the coastal wrensara, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract nectar-feeding insects and birds. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds makes it well adapted to harsh coastal environments. Zygomenes caespitosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
