    "intro": "Zenkeria obtusiflora, commonly known as the African sand dollar, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Zenkeria obtusiflora is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
