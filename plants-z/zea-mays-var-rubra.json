    "intro": "Zea mays var. rubra, commonly known as red corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its striking red kernels. This plant belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to the Americas. The red coloration in its kernels is due to high concentrations of anthocyanin pigments. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes as well as for its nutritional value. The plant typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 3 meters and produces tassels and ears similar to other maize varieties."
