    "intro": "Zonanthemis, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their daisy-like flowers, which typically feature a central yellow disk surrounded by ray florets. Zonanthemis species are native to various regions in Africa and are often found in arid or semi-arid environments. They have a rosette growth habit, with leaves that are usually hairy and adapted to reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
