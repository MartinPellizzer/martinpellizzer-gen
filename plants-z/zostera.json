    "intro": "Zostera, commonly known as eelgrass, is a marine flowering plant found in coastal regions around the world. It thrives in shallow, saline waters and plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic species. Zostera has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, and it forms dense underwater meadows. The plant reproduces through seeds and also spreads via vegetative growth, making it a resilient species in its environment. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy coastal ecosystems."
