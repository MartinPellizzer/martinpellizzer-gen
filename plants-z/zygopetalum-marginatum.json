    "intro": "Zygopetalum marginatum, commonly known as the margined zygopetalum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant features striking, fragrant flowers with a unique color pattern that includes a white base and red or pink margins. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a layer of brownish bark, which helps in water retention. The orchid thrives in humid, well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
