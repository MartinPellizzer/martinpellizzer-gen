    "intro": "Zygia chagrensis, commonly known as the Chagren's zygia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forests. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to habitat loss, Zygia chagrensis is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying plant biodiversity."
