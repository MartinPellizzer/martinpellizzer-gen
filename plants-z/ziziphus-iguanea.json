It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to edible, date-like fruits. Its fruit is rich in sugars and has been used traditionally for its nutritional value. Ziziphus iguanea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
