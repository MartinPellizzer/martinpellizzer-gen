It is a member of the Melanthiaceae family and is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant contains potent cardiotoxic alkaloids, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with extreme caution and is not recommended for cultivation."
