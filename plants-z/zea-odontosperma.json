    "intro": "Zea odontosperma, commonly known as the Mexican maize or teosinte, is a wild grass native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is closely related to modern corn varieties. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in hard, spiky husks, which are characteristic of the genus Zea. Zea odontosperma plays an important role in the evolutionary history of maize, serving as a progenitor species."
