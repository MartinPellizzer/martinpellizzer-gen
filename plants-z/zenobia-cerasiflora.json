It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that resemble cherry blossoms, typically appearing in clusters. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
