    "intro": "Zetocapnia geminiflora, commonly known as the twin-flower orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a short, hairy stem and produces two to three flowers per inflorescence, which is a distinguishing feature. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
