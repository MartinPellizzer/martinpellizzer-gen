    "intro": "Zea mays subsp. indurata, commonly known as the hard-seeded maize, is a subspecies of maize native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tough, fibrous seed coat, which makes the seeds more resistant to mechanical damage and environmental stress. This subspecies is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, where its hardy nature provides an advantage. The plant typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 3 meters, with elongated, narrow leaves. It is primarily cultivated for its seeds, which are used in traditional food preparation and as a source of nutrition."
