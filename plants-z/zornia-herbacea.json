    "intro": "Zornia herbacea, commonly known as the common zornia, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Americas. It typically features slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in small, three-lobed capsules that split open to release the seeds. Zornia herbacea is often found in disturbed soils and is a common weed in agricultural fields."
