    "intro": "Zingiber longipedunculatum var. lambirense, commonly known as the Lambiren ginger, is a rhizomatous herb native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features elongated, narrow leaves that are typically green with a slight pubescence on the underside. The plant produces inflorescences with multiple small, pale yellow to white flowers, which are clustered in long, pendulous spikes. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties. This variant is distinguished by its unique floral structure and habitat preferences compared to other ginger species."
