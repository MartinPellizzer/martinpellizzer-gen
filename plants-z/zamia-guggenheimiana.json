    "intro": "Zamia guggenheimiana, commonly known as the Guggenheim cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a slow-growing plant with a stout, woody trunk and a crown of pinnate, compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones on separate plants. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, though it is not commonly cultivated outside its native habitat. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils."
