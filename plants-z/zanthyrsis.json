    "intro": "Zanthyrsis, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, yellowish-green foliage and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the spring. Zanthyrsis species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their attractive appearance and drought tolerance. They play a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
