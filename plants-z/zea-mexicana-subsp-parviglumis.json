    "intro": "Zea mexicana subsp. parviglumis, commonly known as the small glume maize, is a wild relative of maize native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact stature and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with short, narrow glumes. Its seeds are typically small and hard, adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. This subspecies is of interest to researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to modern maize breeding programs."
