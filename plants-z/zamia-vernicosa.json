    "intro": "Zamia vernicosa, commonly known as the glossy cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones rather than flowers, typical of its ancient lineage. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
