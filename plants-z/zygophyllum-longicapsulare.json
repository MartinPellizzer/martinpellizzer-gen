    "intro": "Zygophyllum longicapsulare, commonly known as the long-capsule sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow or white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. It is adapted to harsh environments, with mechanisms to store water and reduce transpiration. Zygophyllum longicapsulare plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert flora and fauna."
