It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Zornia flemmingioides is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
