    "intro": "Zamia elongata, commonly known as the elongated cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped leaves and a stout, unbranched stem. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Zamia elongata is adapted to well-drained, sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens and collections."
