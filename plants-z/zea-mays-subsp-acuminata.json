    "intro": "Zea mays subsp. acuminata, commonly known as the acuminata maize, is a subspecies of maize native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its tall stature, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and its narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces compact tassels and ears of corn with tightly packed kernels. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and has a shorter growing season compared to other maize subspecies. Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique morphological features and genetic diversity, making it an important species in the study of maize evolution."
