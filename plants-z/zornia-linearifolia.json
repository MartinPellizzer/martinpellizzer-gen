    "intro": "Zornia linearifolia, commonly known as slender zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-arid environments. Zornia linearifolia is typically a low-growing perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
