    "intro": "Zanthoxylum formiciferum, commonly known as the ant-bearing prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and bright red berries that persist into winter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by the distinctive, spiny fruits. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a pungent odor. Zanthoxylum formiciferum is also notable for its association with ants, which inhabit the hollow stems of the plant."
