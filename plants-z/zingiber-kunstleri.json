    "intro": "Zingiber kunstleri, commonly known as the Kunstler's ginger, is a rare and less-studied member of the Zingiberaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers. Its rhizomes are similar to those of other gingers but are not widely used in culinary or medicinal applications. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
