    "intro": "Zieria microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved zieria, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wet tropical regions of eastern Australia. It typically grows in dense, shaded understorey environments, often found in rainforests and coastal heathlands. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length, giving it a delicate appearance. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers appear in clusters during the warmer months, attracting various pollinators. Zieria microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
