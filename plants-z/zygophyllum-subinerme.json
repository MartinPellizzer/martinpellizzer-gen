    "intro": "Zygophyllum subinerme, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from underground water sources. Zygophyllum subinerme is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
