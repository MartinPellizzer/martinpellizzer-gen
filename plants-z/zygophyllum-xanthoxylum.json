    "intro": "Zygophyllum xanthoxylum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, small yellow flowers, and adaptations to harsh, dry environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and help it survive in extreme conditions. It produces capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Zygophyllum xanthoxylum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
