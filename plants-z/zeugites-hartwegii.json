    "intro": "Zeugites hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's zeugite, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
