    "intro": "Zygopetalum sanderae, commonly known as the Sandera's zygopetalum, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a unique blend of purple, pink, and white hues. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its arid and cool habitat. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zygopetalum sanderae is considered a conservation concern."
