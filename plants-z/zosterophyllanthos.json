    "intro": "Zosterophyllanthos, commonly known as the sea whip, is a marine plant belonging to the order Zosterophyllales. It is characterized by its branching, calcified structure that resembles a whip, with a central axis and numerous filaments. The plant is primarily found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches to rocky substrates. Zosterophyllanthos plays a role in providing habitat for various marine organisms. Its structure is composed of calcium carbonate, which contributes to its rigidity and allows it to withstand strong water currents."
