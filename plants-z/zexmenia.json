    "intro": "Zexmenia, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble those of true dandelions. Zexmenia species are often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. They are generally herbaceous perennials with a fibrous root system."
