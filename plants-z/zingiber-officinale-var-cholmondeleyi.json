    "intro": "Zingiber officinale var. cholmondeleyi, commonly known as the red ginger, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange colored flower bracts, which are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that is similar to common ginger (Zingiber officinale), but it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its culinary use. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and have a glossy texture, contributing to its aesthetic appeal. While not typically used in cooking, it shares some chemical compounds with other ginger species, making it of interest in botanical and horticultural studies."
