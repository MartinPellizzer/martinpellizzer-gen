    "intro": "Ziziphus iroensis, commonly known as the American date palm, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It has compound leaves that are alternate and often have a reddish or purplish hue during the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, fleshy drupes that resemble dates. Ziziphus iroensis is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential horticultural use."
