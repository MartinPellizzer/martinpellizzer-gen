    "intro": "Zootrophion vulturiceps, commonly known as the vulture-headed zootrophion, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, wing-like petals that resemble the wings of a vulture, a feature that likely serves to attract specific pollinators. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the early morning, coinciding with the activity of its primary pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
