    "intro": "Zombia antillarum var. gonzalezii, commonly known as the Caribbean zombie fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and unique, spiraling growth pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense rainforests. Its reproductive structures are small, inconspicuous spore capsules that release airborne spores for propagation. Despite its unusual common name, it is not related to any known toxic or parasitic plants."
