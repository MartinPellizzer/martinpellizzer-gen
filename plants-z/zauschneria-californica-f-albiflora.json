    "intro": "Zauschneria californica f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered popcorn flower, is a rare and striking variant of the California poppy. It is characterized by its pale to white petals, which contrast with the typical orange or red hues of the species. This plant is native to coastal areas of California and thrives in well-drained soils. It produces fluffy, seed-filled pods that resemble popcorn, giving it its common name. The f. albiflora form is prized for its unique coloration and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
