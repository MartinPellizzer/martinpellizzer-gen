    "intro": "Zygophyllum atriplicoides subsp. atriplicoides, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is well adapted to sandy soils. It is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, thriving in full sun and low moisture conditions. Its morphology reflects strong evolutionary adaptations to survive in extreme desert climates."
