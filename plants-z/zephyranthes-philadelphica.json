    "intro": "Zephyranthes philadelphica, commonly known as the Philadelphia rain lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to the southeastern United States. It produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, typically in late summer or early fall. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulb, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and often found in open woodlands or prairies. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
