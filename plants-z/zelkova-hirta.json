It belongs to the family Betulaceae and is characterized by its dense, smooth bark and small, oval leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, followed by winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. Zelkova hirta is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a popular choice for urban landscapes. Its historical use in woodworking and as a source of tannins adds to its ecological and cultural significance."
