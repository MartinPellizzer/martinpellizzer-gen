    "intro": "Ziziphus oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved date palm, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree, typically growing up to 5 meters in height, with woody stems and dense foliage. The leaves are narrow and leathery, often arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into small, edible fruits resembling dates, though they are not typically consumed by humans. The plant is well adapted to dry climates and is often used in traditional landscaping and erosion control."
