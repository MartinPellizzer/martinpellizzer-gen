    "intro": "Zygogynum sundaicum, commonly known as the Sunda starfruit, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Marcgraviaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruit but are less commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural habitat."
