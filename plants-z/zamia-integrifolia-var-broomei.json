    "intro": "Zamia integrifolia var. broomei, commonly known as the Broomes' cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
