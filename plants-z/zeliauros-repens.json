    "intro": "Zeliauros repens, commonly known as the creeping zeliauros, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground in a mat-like formation. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. Zeliauros repens thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover."
