    "intro": "Zieria laxiflora, commonly known as the slender zieria, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the wet tropical rainforests of eastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 cm, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its flowers are followed by small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Zieria laxiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments."
