    "intro": "Zanthoxylum magnifructum, commonly known as the large-fruited prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 centimeters long and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its bark and fruits contain bioactive compounds, making it of interest in traditional medicine and phytochemistry. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
