    "intro": "Zamia brongniartii, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Zamiaceae. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded, moist forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zamia brongniartii is considered a vulnerable species."
