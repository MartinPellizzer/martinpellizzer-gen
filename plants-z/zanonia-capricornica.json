    "intro": "Zanonia capricornica, commonly known as the capricorn sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom in the summer months. Zanonia capricornica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
