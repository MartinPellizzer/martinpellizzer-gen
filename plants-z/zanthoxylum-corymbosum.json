    "intro": "Zanthoxylum corymbosum, commonly known as prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnate, with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in corymbs, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine. Zanthoxylum corymbosum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream valleys."
