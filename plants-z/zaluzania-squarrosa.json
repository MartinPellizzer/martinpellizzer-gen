    "intro": "Zaluzania squarrosa, commonly known as the hairy false nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped with a distinctive velvety, hairy texture on both surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, hairy stalks. Its stems are also covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its overall fuzzy appearance. Zaluzania squarrosa is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
