    "intro": "Zapoteca portoricensis subsp. pubicarpa, commonly known as the Puerto Rican zapoteca, is a rare shrub native to the island of Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats, typically found in montane forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant botanical interest for its unique morphology and restricted distribution."
