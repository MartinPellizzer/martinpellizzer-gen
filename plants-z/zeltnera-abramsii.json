    "intro": "Zeltnera abramsii, commonly known as the Arizona zeltnera, is a rare flowering plant native to the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zeltnera abramsii is considered a vulnerable species."
