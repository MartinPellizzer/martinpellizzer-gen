    "intro": "Zanthoxylum alatum f. subtrifoliolatum, commonly known as the three-leafed prickly ash, is a variant of the prickly ash plant native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its branches are often armed with stout, curved spines, which serve as a defense mechanism. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
