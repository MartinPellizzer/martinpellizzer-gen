    "intro": "Zerna distachyos, commonly known as the two-branched millet, is a small annual grass native to southern and eastern Africa. It is characterized by its compact stature and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers arranged in two-branched clusters, which are typical of the genus Zerna. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
