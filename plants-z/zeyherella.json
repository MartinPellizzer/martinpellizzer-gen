These plants are native to regions of southern Africa and are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers. Zeyherella species typically have thick, waxy leaves that help them retain moisture in their native habitats. They are popular as houseplants due to their vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements. The genus includes several species, such as Zeyherella tetragona, which is known for its striking purple flowers."
