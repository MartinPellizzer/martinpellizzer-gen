    "intro": "Zamia imperialis, commonly known as the royal cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the Caribbean islands. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant with a stout, trunk-like stem and pinnate, feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural range, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
