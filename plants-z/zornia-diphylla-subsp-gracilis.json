    "intro": "Zornia diphylla subsp. gracilis, commonly known as slender zornia, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it relies on seed dispersal by wind or animals. The subspecies gracilis is distinguished by its more slender stems and smaller leaves compared to other subspecies of Zornia diphylla."
