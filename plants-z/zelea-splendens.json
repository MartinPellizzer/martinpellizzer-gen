    "intro": "Zelea splendens, commonly known as the golden wax plant, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its striking, glossy, dark green leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by colorful bracts, giving it a showy appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Zelea splendens is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
