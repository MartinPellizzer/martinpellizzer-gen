    "intro": "Zeia repens, commonly known as the creeping zeia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of South America. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, often arranged in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Zeia repens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
