    "intro": "Xanthium oligacanthum, commonly known as stiff burr or common cocklebur, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rough, spiny leaves and large, yellowish-green flowers that develop into prickly, spherical fruits. The plant is native to North America and thrives in disturbed soils, often found along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Its seeds are dispersed by animals and can persist in the soil for several years. Xanthium oligacanthum is considered a weed but has historical use in traditional medicine."
