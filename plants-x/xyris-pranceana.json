    "intro": "Xyris pranceana, commonly known as Prance's yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. Its flowering period occurs in the spring and early summer, producing small, clustered inflorescences that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Xyris pranceana is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
