    "intro": "Xolisma sphaerantha, commonly known as the globe-headed flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, adapting well to harsh desert conditions. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration. Xolisma sphaerantha is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
