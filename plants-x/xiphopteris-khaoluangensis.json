    "intro": "Xiphopteris khaoluangensis, commonly known as the Khaoluang huperzia, is a rare fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Huperjiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
