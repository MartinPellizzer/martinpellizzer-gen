    "intro": "Xyris parvula, commonly known as the dwarf yellow-eyed grass, is a small perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 6 to 12 inches and features grass-like leaves that are narrow and cylindrical. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are surrounded by three pale green bracts. Xyris parvula thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It is an important plant for pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
