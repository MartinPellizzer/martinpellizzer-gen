    "intro": "Xanthisma gypsophilum, commonly known as the gypsum saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found on rocky outcrops or gypsum deposits. Xanthisma gypsophilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
