    "intro": "Xolisma ovalifolia var. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic leaf xolisma, is a species native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with a dense, compact form. Its flowers are small and yellow, clustered in spikes, and bloom during the summer months. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature."
