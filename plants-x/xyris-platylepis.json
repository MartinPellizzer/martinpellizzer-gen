    "intro": "Xyris platylepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved yellow-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to saturated soils. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring. Its botanical name reflects its broad leaves and yellow floral coloration. Xyris platylepis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
