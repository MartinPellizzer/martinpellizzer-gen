    "intro": "Xanthophyllum hainanense var. occidentale, commonly known as the western Hainan goldenflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a glossy surface that helps it retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
