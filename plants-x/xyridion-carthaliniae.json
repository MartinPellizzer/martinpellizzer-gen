    "intro": "Xyridion carthaliniae, commonly known as the Socotra cormus, is a unique plant native to the Socotra Archipelago. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, club-shaped corm that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Xyridion carthaliniae is a rare and endemic species, highlighting the unique botanical diversity of Socotra."
