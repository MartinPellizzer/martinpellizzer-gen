    "intro": "Xylophragma harleyi, commonly known as the African rock orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, often hairy foliage and its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions."
