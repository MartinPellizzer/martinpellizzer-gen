    "intro": "Xyris exilis, commonly known as slender yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of bracted flowers, which are often mistaken for true grasses due to their similar appearance. Xyris exilis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various insects and wildlife."
