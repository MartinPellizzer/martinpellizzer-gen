It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers. The plant is adapted to the dry, arid environments of its native habitat, showcasing xerophytic traits such as thick leaves and reduced water loss. Its flowers typically bloom in the dry season, and it is often found growing in rocky or limestone substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
