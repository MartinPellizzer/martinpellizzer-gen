    "intro": "Xantolis wakere, commonly known as the Waker's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat destruction, Xantolis wakere is considered endangered and is often found in conservation programs aimed at preserving its unique botanical features."
