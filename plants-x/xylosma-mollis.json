    "intro": "Xylosma mollis, commonly known as silky xylosma, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodlands or rocky areas. Xylosma mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
