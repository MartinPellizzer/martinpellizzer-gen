    "intro": "Xyris tortilis, commonly known as the twisted yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence is a dense cluster of small, golden-yellow blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Xyris tortilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
