    "intro": "Xylophacos tephrodes, commonly known as the ash-leaf tephrodes, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species with showy flowers and aromatic leaves. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and its leaves are often covered in a fine, ash-like powder, giving it its common name. Xylophacos tephrodes thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
