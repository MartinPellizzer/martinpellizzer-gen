    "intro": "Xolisma ovalifolia, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom during the spring and early summer. Xolisma ovalifolia is typically found in sandy soils and is often part of the vegetation in desert scrub ecosystems. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for survival in harsh, low-nutrient conditions."
