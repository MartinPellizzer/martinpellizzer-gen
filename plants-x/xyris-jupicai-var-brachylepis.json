    "intro": "Xyris jupicai var. brachylepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh yelloweye, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the genus Xyris, which is part of the family Xyridaceae, commonly known as the yelloweye family. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other Xyris species, making it a unique and ecologically important component of its wetland ecosystem."
