    "intro": "Xyris cheumatophila, commonly known as the narrowleaf yellow-eyed grass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Xyridaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, where it thrives in wetland environments. The plant typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to saturated soil conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Xyris cheumatophila plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
