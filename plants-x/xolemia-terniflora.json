    "intro": "Xolemia terniflora, commonly known as the three-leaf fern, is a species native to tropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies. Its rhizome system allows it to spread slowly across the ground, forming dense mats. Xolemia terniflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
