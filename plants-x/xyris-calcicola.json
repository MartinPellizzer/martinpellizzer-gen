    "intro": "Xyris calcicola, commonly known as the limestone yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in calcareous soils, often found in open woodlands and rocky glades. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it has a compact growth habit. Xyris calcicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
