    "intro": "Xylorhiza angulosa, commonly known as the angular woodroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a fibrous root system and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Xylorhiza angulosa is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses."
