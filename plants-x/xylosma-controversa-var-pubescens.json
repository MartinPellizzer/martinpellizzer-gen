    "intro": "Xylosma controversa var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy xylosma, is a shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, pubescent foliage and small, elliptical leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its bark is often covered in a thick, corky layer, providing structural support and aiding in water retention. This variant is notable for its adaptability to various soil types and its use in traditional medicine."
