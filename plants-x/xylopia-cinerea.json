    "intro": "Xylopia cinerea, commonly known as the gray xylopia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its rough, bark-like stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Xylopia cinerea is often found in humid lowland forests and is known for its aromatic bark, which has been used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of tropical plant biodiversity."
