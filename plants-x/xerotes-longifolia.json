    "intro": "Xerotes longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf xerophyte, is a drought-tolerant shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep underground water sources. Xerotes longifolia is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
