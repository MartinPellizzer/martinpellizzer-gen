    "intro": "Xiphostylis prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate sand verbena, is a low-growing annual herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branching stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Xiphostylis prostratus thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
