    "intro": "Xylia schliebenii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, palmate leaves. The tree produces showy, orange-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, though it is also used in traditional medicine. Xylia schliebenii typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
