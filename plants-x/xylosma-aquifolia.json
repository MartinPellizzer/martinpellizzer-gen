    "intro": "Xylosma aquifolia, commonly known as the waterleaf or water elm, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green on top. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Xylosma aquifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
