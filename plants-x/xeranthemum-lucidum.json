    "intro": "Xeranthemum lucidum, commonly known as the bright-eyed daisy, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant is typically shrub-like, with narrow, linear leaves and produces bright yellow to orange flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Xeranthemum lucidum is also known for its drought tolerance, which is an adaptation to its native arid environment."
