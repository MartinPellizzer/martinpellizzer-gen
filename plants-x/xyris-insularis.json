    "intro": "Xyris insularis, commonly known as the island goldenroot, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, spiky inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often found in shallow water or saturated ground. Xyris insularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
