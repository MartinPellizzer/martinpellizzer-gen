    "intro": "Xiphopteris sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim cliff fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to the Himalayas. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs. The plant has a compact, upright growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Xiphopteris sikkimensis is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in moist, shaded areas within mountainous regions."
