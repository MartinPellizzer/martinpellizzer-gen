It is a perennial shrub that thrives in dry, rocky environments, showcasing its adaptability to arid conditions. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Xeranthemum vermiculatum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
