    "intro": "Xylopia arenaria, commonly known as the sandstone pepper or sandstone wood, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its rough, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round fruits containing smooth, black seeds. Xylopia arenaria is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, coastal or inland areas. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of arid and semi-arid environments."
