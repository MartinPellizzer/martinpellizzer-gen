    "intro": "Xerochlamys villosa, commonly known as the hairy leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its robust, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves covered in dense, hairy structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Xerochlamys villosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance through its thick, waxy leaves. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable but vulnerable species in its native habitat."
