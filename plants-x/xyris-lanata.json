    "intro": "Xyris lanata, commonly known as the downy yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Xyris lanata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
