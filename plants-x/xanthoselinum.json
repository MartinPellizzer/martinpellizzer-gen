    "intro": "Xanthoselinum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by seed heads that resemble those of dandelions. Xanthoselinum is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and a low, spreading growth habit. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
