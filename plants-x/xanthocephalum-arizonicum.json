    "intro": "Xanthocephalum arizonicum, commonly known as Arizona sunhemp, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, hairy stems, and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its seeds are small, oblong, and often covered with a fine, white coating. Arizona sunhemp is often used as a cover crop due to its rapid growth and ability to suppress weeds."
