    "intro": "Xyris capensis var. capensis, commonly known as the Cape goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features grass-like, linear leaves and produces dense clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant is often found in sandy or rocky soils, particularly in coastal and inland regions. It is well adapted to full sun and is drought-tolerant once established. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
