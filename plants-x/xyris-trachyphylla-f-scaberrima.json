    "intro": "Xyris trachyphylla f. scaberrima, commonly known as the roughleaf yellow-eyed grass, is a variant of the yellow-eyed grass species native to eastern North America. It is a perennial herb with grass-like foliage characterized by its rough, scabrous texture on the leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along streambanks. This fern-like plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
