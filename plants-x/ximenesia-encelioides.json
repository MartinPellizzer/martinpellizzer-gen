    "intro": "Ximenesia encelioides, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Ximenesia encelioides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
