It is characterized by its rough, prickly stems and heart-shaped, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spiny, spherical fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along fence rows. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
