    "intro": "Xyris tristis, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Xyris tristis is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and wildlife."
