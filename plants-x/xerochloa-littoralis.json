It is a perennial grass that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale blue. Xerochloa littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
