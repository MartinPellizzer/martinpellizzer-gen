    "intro": "Xanthoxalis micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered everlasting or yellow oxalis, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Oxalidaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces minute, bead-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields. Xanthoxalis micrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
