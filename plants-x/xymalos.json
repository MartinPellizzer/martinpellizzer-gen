It consists of several species, with Xymalos monospermos being the most well-known. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically sword-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, while the stems are often short and stout. Xymalos species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
