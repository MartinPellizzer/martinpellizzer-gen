    "intro": "Xanthium orientale, commonly known as cocklebur, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its prickly, spiny fruit capsules that encase the seeds, which are often dispersed by animals or wind. The plant has palmately lobed leaves with serrated edges and produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters. Xanthium orientale is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. It is considered a weed in many regions but has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
