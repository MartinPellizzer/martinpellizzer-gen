    "intro": "Xyris sororia, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Xyridaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grassy leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Xyris sororia typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring moist, sandy soils. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
