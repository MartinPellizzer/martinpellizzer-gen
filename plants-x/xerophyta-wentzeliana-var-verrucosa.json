    "intro": "Xerophyta wentzeliana var. verrucosa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed spekboom, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This variety is closely related to other species in the Xerophyta genus, which are adapted to dry conditions through various morphological features."
