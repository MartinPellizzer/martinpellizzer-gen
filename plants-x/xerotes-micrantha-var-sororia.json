The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its botanical features include a woody stem, glandular hairs, and a preference for well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
