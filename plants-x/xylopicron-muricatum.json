It is characterized by its dense, hairy stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in small, sharp spines. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to specialized gardens and a subject of interest for botanists. Xylopicron muricatum is adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil."
