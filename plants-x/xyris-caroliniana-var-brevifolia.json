    "intro": "Xyris caroliniana var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps, marshes, and pine flatwoods. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of numerous small, three-lobed flowers that are arranged in a dense, spike-like structure. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact leaves compared to other varieties of Xyris caroliniana."
