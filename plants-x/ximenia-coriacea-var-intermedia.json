    "intro": "Ximenia coriacea var. intermedia, commonly known as the African cherry or wild cherry, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry savannas and woodland areas. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and has traditional uses in medicine and as a source of food for wildlife."
