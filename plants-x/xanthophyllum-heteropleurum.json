    "intro": "Xanthophyllum heteropleurum, commonly known as the golden-leafed fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow-green fronds that are often adorned with intricate, lace-like patterns. The plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Xanthophyllum heteropleurum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in maintaining forest biodiversity."
