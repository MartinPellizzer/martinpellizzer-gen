    "intro": "Xeranthemum serpyllifolium, commonly known as common sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with grayish-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. Xeranthemum serpyllifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in degraded environments."
