    "intro": "Xanthium spinosum, commonly known as cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and distinctive spherical, spiky fruits. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can thrive in a variety of climates. Its seeds are dispersed by animals and can persist in the soil for several years. Xanthium spinosum is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
