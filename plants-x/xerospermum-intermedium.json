    "intro": "Xerospermum intermedium, commonly known as the prairie verbena, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, bright blue or violet flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with fine hairs to reduce water loss, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Xerospermum intermedium plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
