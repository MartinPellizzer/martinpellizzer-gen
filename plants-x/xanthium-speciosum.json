    "intro": "Xanthium speciosum, commonly known as common cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It features rough, prickly leaves with a distinctive lobed shape and produces spherical, spiky fruits that contain seeds. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it relies on wind for pollination. Xanthium speciosum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
