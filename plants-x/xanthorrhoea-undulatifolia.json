It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical trunk and a crown of narrow, grass-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on a spire-like structure. Xanthorrhoea undulatifolia is adapted to arid environments and has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived plant. Its ecological significance includes providing habitat and food for various native animals."
