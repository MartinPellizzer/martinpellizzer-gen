    "intro": "Xanthium orientale var. saccharatum, commonly known as sugarleaf cocklebur, is a variant of the cocklebur plant native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and distinctive yellow flowers. The plant produces spherical, spiky fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas and along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential, it can compete with native plants and is sometimes considered a weed."
