    "intro": "Xanthostemon verticillatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironwood, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The wood of Xanthostemon verticillatus is dense and strong, making it valuable for traditional and contemporary uses."
