    "intro": "Xyris capensis var. angolensis, commonly known as the Angola yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Xyridaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical Xyris capensis."
