    "intro": "Xylocarpus minor, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its root system includes pneumatophores, specialized structures that allow for gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Xylocarpus minor plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
