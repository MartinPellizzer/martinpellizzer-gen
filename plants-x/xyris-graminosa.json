    "intro": "Xyris graminosa, commonly known as yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the genus Xyris in the family Xyridaceae, which includes other grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its grass-like leaves are narrow and grass-green, while its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Xyris graminosa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
