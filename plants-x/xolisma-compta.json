It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. It is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in desert environments. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat."
