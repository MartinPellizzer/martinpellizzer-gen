    "intro": "Xanthoxalis corniculata var. repens, commonly known as creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to South America. It features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread across the ground, forming dense mats. The plant has small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are usually hairy and have a distinctive heart-shaped base. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
