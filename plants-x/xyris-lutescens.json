    "intro": "Xyris lutescens, commonly known as the yellow marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in saturated soils. Xyris lutescens plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
