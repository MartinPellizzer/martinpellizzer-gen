    "intro": "Xanthisma spinulosum var. austrotexanum, commonly known as the Texas sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Goodeniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces yellowish or greenish flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. This variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Xanthisma spinulosum."
