    "intro": "Xylopicrum spruceanum, commonly known as the Spruceleaf xylopicrum, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
