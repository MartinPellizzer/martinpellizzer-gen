    "intro": "Xenophyllum funkianum, commonly known as the Funk's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble translucent, ghostly shapes, often appearing as if they are floating in the air. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, inconspicuous leaves that blend into the surrounding foliage. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Xenophyllum funkianum is considered endangered and is rarely seen in the wild."
