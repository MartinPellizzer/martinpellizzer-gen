    "intro": "Xanthocephalum petradoria, commonly known as the coastal flax or sand flax, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, thriving in saline and well-drained environments. It features slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters. Xanthocephalum petradoria is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
