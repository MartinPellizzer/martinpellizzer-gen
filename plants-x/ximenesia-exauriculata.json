    "intro": "Ximenesia exauriculata, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Ximenesia exauriculata is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of charcoal."
