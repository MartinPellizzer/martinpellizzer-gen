    "intro": "Xolisma ligustrina var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy boxwood, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, with leaves that are typically small, oval, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often used as a foundation plant or in rock gardens."
