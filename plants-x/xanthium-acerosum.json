    "intro": "Xanthium acerosum, commonly known as common cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, prickly fruits that encase the seeds, which are often dispersed by animals. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along fence rows. Xanthium acerosum is considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
