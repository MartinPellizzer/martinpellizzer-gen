    "intro": "Xyris capensis, commonly known as the Cape marsh yellow, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Xyridaceae family, which includes many grass-like plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in wet, marshy areas and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. Xyris capensis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
