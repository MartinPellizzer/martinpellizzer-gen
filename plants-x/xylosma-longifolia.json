    "intro": "Xylosma longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf xylosma, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often leathery in texture. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. Xylosma longifolia is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
