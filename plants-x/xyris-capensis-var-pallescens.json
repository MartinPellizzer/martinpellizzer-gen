It typically grows in wet, marshy habitats and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in waterlogged soils. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom during the summer months. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in wetland ecosystems."
