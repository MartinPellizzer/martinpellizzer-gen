    "intro": "Xanthium occidentale, commonly known as common cocklebur, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical fruits that encase the seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves with rough textures and can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along creek banks. Xanthium occidentale is known for its yellowish-green flowers and its role as a weed in agricultural settings."
