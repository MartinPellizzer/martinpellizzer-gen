    "intro": "Xeranthemum radicans, commonly known as the trailing sandverbena, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or hang from containers. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
