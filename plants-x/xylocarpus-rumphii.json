    "intro": "Xylocarpus rumphii, commonly known as the mangrove apple, is a tropical tree belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its woody structure and is typically found in brackish water environments, such as mangrove forests. The plant has thick, fleshy fruits that contain a single large seed, adapted for dispersal in aquatic conditions. Its roots are often modified into pneumatophores, which help in gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Xylocarpus rumphii plays a vital ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
