    "intro": "Xylobium filomenoi, commonly known as the Filomena xylobium, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly waxy texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Xylobium filomenoi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
