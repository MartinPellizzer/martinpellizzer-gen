    "intro": "Xerosicyos, commonly known as the desert gourd, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, melons, and squash. The plant is characterized by its woody, branching stems and small, pale green leaves. Xerosicyos produces yellow or green flowers that give way to elongated, cylindrical fruits. It is well adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss."
