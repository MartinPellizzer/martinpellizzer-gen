    "intro": "Ximenesia cordata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Ximenesia cordata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in arid landscapes."
