    "intro": "Xeranthemum pungens, commonly known as the spiked chamomile, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Xeranthemum pungens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its drought tolerance and vibrant floral display."
