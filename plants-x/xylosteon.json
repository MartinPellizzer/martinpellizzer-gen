    "intro": "Xylosteon, commonly known as the \"false acacia,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to greenish flowers arranged in racemes, which are often clustered together. Xylosteon species are native to various regions in Africa and are adapted to dry and semi-arid environments. They play a role in soil stabilization and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
