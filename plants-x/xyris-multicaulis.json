    "intro": "Xyris multicaulis, commonly known as the clustered yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Xyridaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of small, clustered blooms. Xyris multicaulis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
