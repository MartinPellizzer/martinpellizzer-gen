It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, simple, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. The fruits are typically split open to reveal a sticky, orange pulp containing seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry regions."
