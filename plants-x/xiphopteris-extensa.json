    "intro": "Xiphopteris extensa, commonly known as the broad-leafed huperzia, is a species of clubmoss found in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often slightly curled at the tips. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil. Its sporophylls are arranged in whorls and produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia. Xiphopteris extensa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and air-purifying qualities."
