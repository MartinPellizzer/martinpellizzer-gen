    "intro": "Xyris trachyphylla, commonly known as the roughleaf goldeneye, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features grass-like leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its common name, and produces yellowish-green to yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers. Xyris trachyphylla plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
