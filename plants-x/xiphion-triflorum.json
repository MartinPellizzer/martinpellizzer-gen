    "intro": "Xiphion triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant features strap-like, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. Xiphion triflorum produces clusters of three to five flowers per stem, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained, sandy soils."
