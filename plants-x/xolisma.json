    "intro": "Xolisma, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often blooming in summer. Xolisma has adapted to survive in harsh environments with its deep root system and ability to store water. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss."
