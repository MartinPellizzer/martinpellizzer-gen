    "intro": "Ximenia americana var. sphaerica, commonly known as the globe ximenia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by spherical, red fruits that contain a single seed. Its fruit is edible when ripe, though the pulp is often described as having a tart, acidic flavor. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
