    "intro": "Xylorhiza scopulorum, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky regions. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted for water storage, typical of xerophytic plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Xylorhiza scopulorum is often found in crevices and on rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils."
