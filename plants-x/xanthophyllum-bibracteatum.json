    "intro": "Xanthophyllum bibracteatum, commonly known as the golden bract fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow fronds that contrast with its dark green base. The plant features specialized bracts that protect its reproductive structures, a trait that sets it apart from many other ferns. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
