It features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with distinctive red margins. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Xyris rubromarginata is part of the Xyridaceae family, which includes other species of yellow-eyed grass. Its striking floral display makes it a valuable addition to wetland restoration projects and native plant gardens."
