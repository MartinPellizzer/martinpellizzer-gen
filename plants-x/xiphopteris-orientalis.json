    "intro": "Xiphopteris orientalis, commonly known as the oriental holly fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its upright, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Xiphopteris orientalis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
