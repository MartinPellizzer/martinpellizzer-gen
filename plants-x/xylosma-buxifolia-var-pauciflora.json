    "intro": "Xylosma buxifolia var. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered xylosma, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental leaves and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
