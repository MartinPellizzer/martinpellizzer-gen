    "intro": "Xerocarpus hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy false indigo, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, small gray-green leaves, and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring deep roots and a compact growth form to conserve water. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological role in dryland ecosystems. Xerocarpus hirsutus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
