    "intro": "Xylosma salzmannii var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf xylosma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptic or ovate in shape. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, which are often mistaken for fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. The wood of this plant is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and carving."
