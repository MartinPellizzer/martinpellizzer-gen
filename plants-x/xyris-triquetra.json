    "intro": "Xyris triquetra, commonly known as the three-angled yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features grass-like leaves that are narrow and linear, with a fibrous root system. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the late spring to early summer. Its botanical name reflects the triangular shape of its seed pods, which are a distinctive feature. Xyris triquetra is often found in moist, sandy soils in wetlands and along stream banks."
