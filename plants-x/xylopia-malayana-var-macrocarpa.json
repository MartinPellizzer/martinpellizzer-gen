It belongs to the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by large, woody, globose fruits. Its fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, aromatic aril, which is an adaptation for animal dispersal. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in local medicine."
