    "intro": "Xerophyta suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its yellow flowers are clustered in umbels and emit a pleasant fragrance, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Xerophyta suaveolens is also valued for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional medicine."
