    "intro": "Xyris setigera, commonly known as the narrowleaf goldeneye, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of yellow to orange flowers. Xyris setigera is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
