    "intro": "Xanthomyrtus klossii var. brevipedunculata, commonly known as the short-stemmed myrtle, is a shrub native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
