    "intro": "Xyris trachyphylla f. primaria, commonly known as the roughleaf goldeneye, is a variant of the goldeneye plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers in the spring. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a compact, low-growing habit. The subspecies f. primaria is distinguished by its rough, textured leaf surfaces and is valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland restoration projects."
