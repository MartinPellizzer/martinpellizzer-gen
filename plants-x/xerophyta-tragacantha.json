It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid environments. Xerophyta tragacantha is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
