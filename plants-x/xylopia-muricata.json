It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its rough, bark-like texture on its fruit. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a follicle that develops into a spiny, woody capsule, which contains several seeds. Xylopia muricata is often found in moist, shaded habitats within forests."
