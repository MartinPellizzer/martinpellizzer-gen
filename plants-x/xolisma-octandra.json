    "intro": "Xolisma octandra, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Xolisma octandra is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its latex-like sap contains compounds that can be toxic to livestock and humans if ingested."
