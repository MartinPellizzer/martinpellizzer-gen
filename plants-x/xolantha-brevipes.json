    "intro": "Xolantha brevipes, commonly known as the short-footed xolantha, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces small, bright-colored blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are opposite and lanceolate, often with a slightly hairy texture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Xolantha brevipes is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
