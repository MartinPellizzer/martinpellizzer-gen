    "intro": "Xanthorrhoea glauca subsp. glauca, commonly known as the blue grass tree, is a unique and ancient plant native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of narrow, grass-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. The species is also notable for its ability to remain dormant for long periods, resuming growth only after heavy rainfall."
