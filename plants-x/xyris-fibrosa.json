    "intro": "Xyris fibrosa, commonly known as the fibrous yellow-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces yellowish to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence is a dense cluster of small, three-lobed flowers that bloom in a spike-like arrangement. Xyris fibrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
