    "intro": "Xylia perrieri, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elliptical, woody fruits that contain a single seed. Xylia perrieri is often found in dry, rocky habitats and can grow up to 15 meters in height. Due to its slow growth and high demand for its timber, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
