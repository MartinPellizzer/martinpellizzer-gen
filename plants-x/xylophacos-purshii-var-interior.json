    "intro": "Xylophacos purshii var. interior, commonly known as the interior xylophacos, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
