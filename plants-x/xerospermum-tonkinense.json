    "intro": "Xerospermum tonkinense, commonly known as the Vietnamese tansy, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers that are arranged in clusters. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Xerospermum tonkinense is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
