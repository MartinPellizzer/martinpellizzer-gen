    "intro": "Xylocarpus gangeticus, commonly known as the Indian mangrove or white mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Meliaceae. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in coastal areas and tidal mudflats, particularly in the Indian subcontinent. The plant is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, and it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. The tree is also valued for its timber and is used in traditional medicine."
