It belongs to the family Xyridaceae, which includes various grass-like plants known for their showy yellow flowers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow blooms that appear in late spring to early summer. Xyris dilatatiscapa is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated conditions."
