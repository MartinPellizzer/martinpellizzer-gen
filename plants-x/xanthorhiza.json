The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It features trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Xanthorhiza has a long history of traditional use for its purported health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
