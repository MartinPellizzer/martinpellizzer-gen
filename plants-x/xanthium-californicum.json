    "intro": "Xanthium californicum, commonly known as California cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in fields. The plant produces spiny, spherical fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous coating. Its leaves are heart-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces, and it has yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
