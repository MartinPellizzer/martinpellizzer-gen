    "intro": "Xeraea nitida, commonly known as the silver leaf tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-white, velvety leaves that provide a striking visual contrast against its dark bark. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, red, berry-like fruits. Xeraea nitida is well adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
