    "intro": "Xyris scabra, commonly known as rough marsh yelloweye, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers in the spring. Its flowers are often surrounded by three to five narrow, leaf-like bracts. Xyris scabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
