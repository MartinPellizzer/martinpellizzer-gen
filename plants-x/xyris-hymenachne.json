    "intro": "Xyris hymenachne, commonly known as narrowleaf goldeneye, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and yellowish flower spikes. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators. Xyris hymenachne is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
