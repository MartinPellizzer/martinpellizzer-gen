    "intro": "Xanthium globosum, commonly known as cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It features a hairy stem with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces spherical, spiky fruit capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it is commonly found in disturbed soils such as fields and roadsides. Xanthium globosum is known for its prickly seed heads, which can cause irritation to humans and animals."
