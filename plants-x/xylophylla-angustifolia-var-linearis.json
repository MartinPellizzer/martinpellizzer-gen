    "intro": "Xylophylla angustifolia var. linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed woodfern, is a variant of the woodfern family with distinctive, linear leaves. It is characterized by its slender, elongated foliage that often forms a dense, upright clump. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form colonies. The leaves are usually dark green and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal in woodland gardens."
