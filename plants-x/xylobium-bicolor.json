    "intro": "Xylobium bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored wood lichen, is a member of the family Xylobiaceae. It is a lichen that forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. The plant is characterized by its distinctive two-toned thallus, which typically displays a yellowish or orange upper surface and a darker, more leathery lower surface. It grows on decaying wood, particularly in moist, shaded environments. Xylobium bicolor is often found in temperate regions and is used in ecological studies to assess forest health and biodiversity."
