It features small, orbicular (rounded) leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Xylosma orbiculata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
