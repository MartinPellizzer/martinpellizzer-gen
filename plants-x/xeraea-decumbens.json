    "intro": "Xeraea decumbens, commonly known as the creeping xeraea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils. Xeraea decumbens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
