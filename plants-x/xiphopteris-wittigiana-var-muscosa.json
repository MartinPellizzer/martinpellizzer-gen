    "intro": "Xiphopteris wittigiana var. muscosa, commonly known as the mossy cliff fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a unique textured appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and shaded, moist soils, thriving in humid, woodland environments. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. This varietal form is distinguished by its dense, velvety foliage, which contributes to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for small organisms."
