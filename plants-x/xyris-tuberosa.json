    "intro": "Xyris tuberosa, commonly known as yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the summer months. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Xyris tuberosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
