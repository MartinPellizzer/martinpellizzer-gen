    "intro": "Xatardia scabra, commonly known as the rough xatardia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fibrous, branched stems and narrow, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late summer. Xatardia scabra thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
