    "intro": "Xyloolaena humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's woodfern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that create a lush, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in dense rainforests where it clings to tree trunks or grows on rocky surfaces. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its unique botanical profile. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Xyloolaena humbertii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
