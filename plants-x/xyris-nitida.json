    "intro": "Xyris nitida, commonly known as slender marsh yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its inflorescence is a dense spike that can reach up to 12 inches in length, making it visually striking in wetland environments. Xyris nitida plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
