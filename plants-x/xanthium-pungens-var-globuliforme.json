It is characterized by its spherical, spiny seed heads that resemble small globes, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by the distinctive, prickly fruits. Its leaves are alternate, rough to the touch, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas."
