    "intro": "Xylobium ortizianum, commonly known as the Ortizian wood lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant has a short, stout stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Xylobium ortizianum is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
