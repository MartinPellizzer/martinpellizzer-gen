    "intro": "Xanthomyrtus lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. These flowers are followed by small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Xanthomyrtus lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance and ability to thrive in sandy soils."
