    "intro": "Xolemia collinsiana, commonly known as the Collins' xolemia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in the dappled light. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Xolemia collinsiana is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
