    "intro": "Xerospermum glabratum, commonly known as the plains coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the central and western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils, showing a preference for well-drained environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Xerospermum glabratum is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
