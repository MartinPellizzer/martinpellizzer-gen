    "intro": "Xysmalobium gomphocarpoides var. parvilobum, commonly known as the small-lobed ghostflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, typically found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
