    "intro": "Xestaea, commonly known as the grass or a type of moth, is a genus of moths in the family Noctuidae. These moths are typically found in various regions across the globe, with species exhibiting a wide range of habitats. The larvae of Xestaea species often feed on grasses and other plants, contributing to their ecological role in nutrient cycling. The adult moths are usually small, with wings that vary in color and pattern depending on the species. Botanically, Xestaea is more closely related to plants than to other insects, as it belongs to the order Lepidoptera, which includes both butterflies and moths."
