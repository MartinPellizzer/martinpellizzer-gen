    "intro": "Xyris caroliniana var. scabra, commonly known as the rough marsh yelloweye, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are surrounded by a short, tubular bract, and the plant is known for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding. The rough texture of its stems and leaves gives it its common name, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
