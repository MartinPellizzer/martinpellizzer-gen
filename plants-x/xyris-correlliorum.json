    "intro": "Xyris correlliorum, commonly known as the Florida marsh yelloweye, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are grass-like and form a basal rosette, while its stems are erect and bear the showy yellow flowers. Xyris correlliorum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
