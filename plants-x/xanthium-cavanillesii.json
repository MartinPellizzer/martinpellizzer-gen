    "intro": "Xanthium cavanillesii, commonly known as the rough cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its prickly, spiny leaves and spherical, rough-hairy fruit capsules. The plant typically grows in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in heads, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Xanthium cavanillesii is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
