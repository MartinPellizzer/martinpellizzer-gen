    "intro": "Xylobium, commonly known as the wax tree or waxplant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of a few species, most notably Xylobium parvum, which is native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often with a yellow or orange hue. Xylobium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
