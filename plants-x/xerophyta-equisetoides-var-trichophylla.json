    "intro": "Xerophyta equisetoides var. trichophylla, commonly known as the woolly flame grass, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It has a rosette growth form, with fleshy, cylindrical leaves that store water. This variety is well adapted to dry conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
