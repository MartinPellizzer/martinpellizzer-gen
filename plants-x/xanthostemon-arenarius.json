    "intro": "Xanthostemon arenarius, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically red or pink in color. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dunes or along the coastline. Xanthostemon arenarius is well-suited to coastal environments due to its salt tolerance and drought resistance."
