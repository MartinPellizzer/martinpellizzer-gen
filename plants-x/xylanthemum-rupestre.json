    "intro": "Xylanthemum rupestre, commonly known as the rock thyme, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
