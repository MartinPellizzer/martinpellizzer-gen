    "intro": "Xanthium strumarium var. glabratum, commonly known as the rough cocklebur, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, prickly leaves and stems, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are covered in hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along fence rows. Botanically, it is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and wind-pollinated flowers."
