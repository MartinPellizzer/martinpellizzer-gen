    "intro": "Xanthium macrocarpum subsp. italicum, commonly known as the Italian cocklebur, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is a biennial or perennial herb characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and distinctive, spherical fruit that contains several seeds. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the sunflower family. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it easily identifiable, though it can be confused with other similar species in the genus Xanthium."
