    "intro": "Xylon samauma, commonly known as the redwood tree, is a towering evergreen conifer native to the coastal forests of California and southern Oregon. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and thick, reddish-brown bark that provides protection against fire and pests. The tree's needles are dark green and shed annually, while its cones are small and woody. Xylon samauma grows slowly, reaching heights of up to 115 meters, and can live for over 2,000 years. Its wood is highly valued for its strength, durability, and unique aesthetic qualities."
