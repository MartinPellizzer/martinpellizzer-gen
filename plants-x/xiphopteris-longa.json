    "intro": "Xiphopteris longa, commonly known as the long frond fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its long, narrow, and often drooping fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori. Xiphopteris longa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
