    "intro": "Xerochloa imberbis var. repens, commonly known as creeping hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or open grasslands. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
