    "intro": "Xanthium spinosum var. pseudinerme, commonly known as the prickly lettuce or false prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and rough, hairy stems, which help in seed dispersal. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into spiny, globe-shaped fruits. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. This species is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in some areas."
