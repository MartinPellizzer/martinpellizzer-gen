It belongs to the Xyridaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and showy, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Xyris glaucella is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability."
