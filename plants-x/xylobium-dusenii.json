    "intro": "Xylobium dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's xylobium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Xylobium dusenii is considered a vulnerable species."
