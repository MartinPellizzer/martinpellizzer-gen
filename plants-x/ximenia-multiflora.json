    "intro": "Ximenia multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered ximenia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the axils of the leaves. The plant produces small, round, yellow or orange fruits that are edible but have a sour taste. Ximenia multiflora thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry savannas and woodland areas. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in some cultures."
