    "intro": "Xolemia trachiloma, commonly known as the roughleaf orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests. Xolemia trachiloma has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in rocky or clay soils. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a distinctive species within the orchid family."
