    "intro": "Xerophyta eglandulosa var. hirtocarpa, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed silver bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, aiding survival in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. This variant is particularly adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, coastal regions."
