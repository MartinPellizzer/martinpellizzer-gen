It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its clumping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spikelets at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
