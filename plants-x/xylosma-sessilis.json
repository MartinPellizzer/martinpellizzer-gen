It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, simple leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits.

It is valued for its ornamental potential and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
