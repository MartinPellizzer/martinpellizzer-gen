It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its rough, bark-like stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Xanthostemon rugosus is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
