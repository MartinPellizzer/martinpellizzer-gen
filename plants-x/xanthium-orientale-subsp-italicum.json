    "intro": "Xanthium orientale subsp. italicum, commonly known as Italian cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prickly, spiny leaves and spherical, rough-seeded fruits. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with hairy stems and alternate foliage. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces a distinctive, burr-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
