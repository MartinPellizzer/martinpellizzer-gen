    "intro": "Xeraea agrestis, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Xeraea agrestis thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions."
