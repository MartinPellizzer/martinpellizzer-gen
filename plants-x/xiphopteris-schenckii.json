    "intro": "Xiphopteris schenckii, commonly known as the Schenck's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the soil surface. Xiphopteris schenckii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
