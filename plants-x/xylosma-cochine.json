    "intro": "Xylosma cochine, commonly known as red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Xylosma cochine is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in traditional crafts and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in many parts of its native range."
