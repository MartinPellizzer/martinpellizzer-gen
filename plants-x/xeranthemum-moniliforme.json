    "intro": "Xeranthemum moniliforme, commonly known as the beadflower, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that resemble beads. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Xeranthemum moniliforme is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid environments."
