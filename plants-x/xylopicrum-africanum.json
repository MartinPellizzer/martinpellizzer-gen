    "intro": "Xylopicrum africanum, commonly known as the African xylophone tree, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small leaflets, and the flowers are small, clustered in racemes, typically in shades of yellow or green. The tree produces pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution. It is often found in savanna and woodland habitats, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
