    "intro": "Xanthocyparis pendula, commonly known as the golden cypress, is a rare and striking conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its pendulous, golden-yellow foliage that cascades from its narrow, columnar form. The plant has scale-like leaves that are densely packed and emit a fragrant aroma, typical of many cypress species. It produces small, spherical cones that mature to a dark purple color, adding visual interest to its appearance. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
