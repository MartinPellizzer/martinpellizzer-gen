It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish to brownish flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Xanthocephalum sarothrae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native gardens."
