    "intro": "Xylobium chapadense var. luteoalbo, commonly known as the yellow-white wood lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid tropical and subtropical environments. It typically grows on tree bark, especially on broad-leaved trees, and forms a thin, pale yellowish to white crust-like layer. The thallus is lecanorine, with a distinct upper cortex and a loosely structured medulla. It contains several secondary metabolites, including atranorin and divaricatic acid, which contribute to its chemical profile. This lichen is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
