    "intro": "Xylosteon hispidum var. maximum, commonly known as the woolly xylosteon, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with hairy, grey-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, woody capsules containing small, hard seeds. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
