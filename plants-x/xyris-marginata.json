    "intro": "Xyris marginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical characteristics include a rhizomatous root system and small, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating. Xyris marginata plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
