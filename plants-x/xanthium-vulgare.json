    "intro": "Xanthium vulgare, commonly known as cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, rough-textured leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces spherical, prickly fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Xanthium vulgare is considered a weed in agricultural settings but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
