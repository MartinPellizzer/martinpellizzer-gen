    "intro": "Xiphion diversifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Xiphion diversifolium is valued for its ornamental beauty and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
