    "intro": "Xysmalobium undulatum, commonly known as the undulating lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Xysmalobium undulatum is a perennial species that produces seed pods containing numerous small, hard seeds."
