    "intro": "Xerotes, commonly known as the desert rose, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features fleshy, water-storing stems and leaves that are adapted to minimize water loss. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often blooming during the rainy season. Xerotes thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Its ability to survive in harsh, dry environments makes it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens."
