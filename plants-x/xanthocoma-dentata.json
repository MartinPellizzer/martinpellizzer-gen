    "intro": "Xanthocoma dentata, commonly known as the toothed yellowroot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its distinctive yellow roots and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Xanthocoma dentata is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is adapted to thrive in rich, organic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
