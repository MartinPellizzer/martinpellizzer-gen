It belongs to the family Tiliaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with three distinct veins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Xylosma trinervia is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for local use in construction and crafts."
