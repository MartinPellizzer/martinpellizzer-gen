    "intro": "Xantholinum tauricum, commonly known as the Tauric Yellowwood, is a rare flowering plant native to the southern regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and woody stems, which are typical of the Rutaceae family. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth texture and a slightly aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
