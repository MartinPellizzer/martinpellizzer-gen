It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the late spring to early summer. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in wet environments. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
