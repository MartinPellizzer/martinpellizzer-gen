    "intro": "Xyris chapmanii, commonly known as Chapman's yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Xyridaceae, which includes various species of yellow-eyed grasses. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. It produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture in its wetland environment."
