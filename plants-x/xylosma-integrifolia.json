    "intro": "Xylosma integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf xylosma, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Xylosma integrifolia is also valued for its ability to thrive in rocky and sandy soils."
