It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor. Xiphopteris hyalina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
