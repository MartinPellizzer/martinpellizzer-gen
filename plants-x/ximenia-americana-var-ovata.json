    "intro": "Ximenia americana var. ovata, commonly known as the oval ximenia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical, glossy dark green leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by yellow, fleshy berries that are edible but have a strong, acidic taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas, mangroves, and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
