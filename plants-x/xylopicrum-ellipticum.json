    "intro": "Xylopicrum ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptical woodroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of elongated, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can be harvested for their medicinal properties, which include anti-inflammatory and antiseptic effects. Xylopicrum ellipticum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded meadows."
