    "intro": "Xeranthemum, commonly known as the desert marigold, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and Mexico. Xeranthemum species are typically shrubs or subshrubs with hairy, gray-green leaves adapted to conserve water. Their showy yellow or orange flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates."
