    "intro": "Xeraea parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered xeraea, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hair. It is adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and roots. Xeraea parviflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
