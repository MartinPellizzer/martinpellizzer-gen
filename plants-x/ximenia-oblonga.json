    "intro": "Ximenia oblonga, commonly known as the African wild cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, elliptical fruits that contain several seeds. Ximenia oblonga is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. It has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties and as a source of timber."
