It is characterized by its dense, spreading growth habit and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Xeraea leucocephala is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
