    "intro": "Xiphopteris villosissima, commonly known as the hairy cliff brake, is a fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, wiry fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, acidic soils, often found on cliffs and in shaded woodland areas. Its spores are released from small, round sori located on the underside of the fronds. Xiphopteris villosissima is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that is well adapted to humid, moist environments."
