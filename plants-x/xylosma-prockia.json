    "intro": "Xylosma prockia, commonly known as the Hawaiian xylosma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Flacourtiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that contain one or two seeds. Xylosma prockia is adapted to the dry, coastal environments of Hawaii, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
