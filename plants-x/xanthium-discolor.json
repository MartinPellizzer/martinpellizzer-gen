    "intro": "Xanthium discolor, commonly known as the common cocklebur, is a prickly annual herb native to North America. It features a hairy, branching stem and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces spiny, spherical fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, yellowish coating. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical characteristics make it both a weed and a plant with historical use in traditional medicine."
