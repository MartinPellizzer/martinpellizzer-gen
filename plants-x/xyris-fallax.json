    "intro": "Xyris fallax, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in clusters during the spring. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Xyris fallax thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
