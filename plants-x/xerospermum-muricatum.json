    "intro": "Xerospermum muricatum, commonly known as the roughleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and conical flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. It produces small, dark purple to brown seeds that are adapted for wind dispersal. Xerospermum muricatum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
