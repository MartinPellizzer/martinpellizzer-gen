It belongs to the family Xyridaceae, which includes various species of yellow-eyed grasses. The plant is characterized by its compact, rounded inflorescence that resembles a globe, hence its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense clusters at the base. The flowers, which are yellow and tubular, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
