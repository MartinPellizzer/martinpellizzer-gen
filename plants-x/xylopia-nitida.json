It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by berry-like fruits containing several seeds. Xylopia nitida is often found in moist, shaded forest environments, where it plays a role in local ecosystems. Its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties have made it of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
