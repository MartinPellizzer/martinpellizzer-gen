    "intro": "Xeranthemum radiatum var. pictum, commonly known as the painted sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant blooms and drought tolerance."
