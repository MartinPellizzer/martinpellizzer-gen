    "intro": "Xiphopteris bryophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of clubmoss native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has simple, linear leaves that are arranged spirally along its stems, giving it a delicate, grass-like appearance. It produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations at the base of the leaves. Xiphopteris bryophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
