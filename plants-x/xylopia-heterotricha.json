    "intro": "Xylopia heterotricha, commonly known as the African star anise, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, star-shaped fruits that resemble those of the star anise. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers and has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its fruit is a globose, five-lobed capsule that splits open when mature, releasing small, winged seeds. Xylopia heterotricha is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional medicine for its antispasmodic and digestive benefits."
