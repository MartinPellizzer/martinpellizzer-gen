It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which contribute to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Xeranthemum annettae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
