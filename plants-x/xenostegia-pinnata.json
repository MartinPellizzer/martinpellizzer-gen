    "intro": "Xenostegia pinnata, commonly known as the showy xenostegia, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its opposite, pinnately compound leaves that are often adorned with distinctive glandular hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental use in warm climates. However, it can become invasive if not properly managed."
