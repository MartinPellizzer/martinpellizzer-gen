    "intro": "Xylotheca solmsii, commonly known as the Solms' wood lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Teloschistaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green to brownish thallus with a distinctive, often lobed or branched structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, with the fungal component providing structure and the algal partner performing photosynthesis. It typically grows on tree bark, especially in humid and shaded environments. Xylotheca solmsii is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested areas where moisture is abundant."
