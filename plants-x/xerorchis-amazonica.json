    "intro": "Xerorchis amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers. The plant has a unique ability to store water in its pseudobulbs, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Xerorchis amazonica is considered critically endangered."
