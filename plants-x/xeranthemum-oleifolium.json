    "intro": "Xeranthemum oleifolium, commonly known as the Spanish lavender or rock lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces dense clusters of small, fragrant blue or purple flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Xeranthemum oleifolium is often used in ornamental gardening and has historical uses in herbal medicine."
