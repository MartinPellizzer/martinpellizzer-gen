    "intro": "Xanthorrhoea latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved grass tree, is a unique species native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, woody stem and a dense crown of long, narrow leaves. The plant produces a distinctive inflorescence of yellow flowers, which emerge from the base of the stem. Xanthorrhoea latifolia is adapted to fire-prone environments and can resprout from its underground rhizome after bushfires. Its slow growth and longevity make it a significant component of the local flora."
