    "intro": "Xyris savanensis var. procera, commonly known as the tall marsh yellow-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in early to mid-summer. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are arranged in a panicle-like structure. This variety is distinguished by its taller stature compared to other varieties of Xyris, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters."
