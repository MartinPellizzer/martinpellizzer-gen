    "intro": "Xyris insignis, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Xyridaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of small, bright yellow blooms. Xyris insignis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
