It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. Xylopia pierrei is valued for its aromatic bark and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and pharmacological contexts."
