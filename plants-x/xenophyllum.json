    "intro": "Xenophyllum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique member of the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Xenophyllum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
