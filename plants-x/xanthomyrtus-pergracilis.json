    "intro": "Xanthomyrtus pergracilis, commonly known as the slender myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Xanthomyrtus pergracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize dunes in coastal ecosystems."
