    "intro": "Xiquexique gounellei subsp. gounellei, commonly known as the Guianese xiquexique, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Guyanas. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
