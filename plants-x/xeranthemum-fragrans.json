    "intro": "Xeranthemum fragrans, commonly known as sweet everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces showy, fragrant yellow or orange flowers. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Xeranthemum fragrans is also valued for its long-lasting flowers, which remain intact even when dried."
