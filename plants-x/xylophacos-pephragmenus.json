    "intro": "Xylophacos pephragmenus, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Xylophacos pephragmenus is an important plant for pollinators and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant landscaping."
