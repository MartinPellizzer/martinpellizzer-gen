    "intro": "Xyris jupicae, commonly known as the Florida marsh yelloweye, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Xyridaceae, which includes various grass-like plants known for their showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to the ecological stability of its environment. Xyris jupicae is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of bright yellow blooms that appear in late spring to early summer."
