    "intro": "Xyropteris stortii, commonly known as the Stort's water fern, is a member of the fern family, specifically the Oleandraceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and slightly serrated. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Xyropteris stortii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
