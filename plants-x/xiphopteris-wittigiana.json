    "intro": "Xiphopteris wittigiana, commonly known as the Wittig's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing moisture. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
