    "intro": "Xiphopteris ascensionensis, commonly known as the Ascension Island cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the remote Ascension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, pinnate leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat and is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its restricted range and habitat vulnerability, it is considered an endangered species."
