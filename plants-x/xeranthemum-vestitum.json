    "intro": "Xeranthemum vestitum, commonly known as the clothed xeranthemum, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Xeranthemum vestitum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
