    "intro": "Xylosma buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf xylosma, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that resemble those of boxwood, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Xylosma buxifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
