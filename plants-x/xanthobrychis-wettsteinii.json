    "intro": "Xanthobrychis wettsteinii, commonly known as the Wettstein's bladderwort, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. It possesses specialized structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms for nourishment. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of water quality."
