    "intro": "Xerotes collina, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Xerotes collina thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for coastal climates. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for native pollinators and stabilizing dune ecosystems."
