    "intro": "Xolisma fasciculata, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Xolisma fasciculata is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
