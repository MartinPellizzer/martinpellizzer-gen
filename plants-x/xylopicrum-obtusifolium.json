    "intro": "Xylopicrum obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaf woodplant, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features dense, woody stems that are often covered in a thick layer of bark, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a leathery texture, with a bluish-green hue that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
