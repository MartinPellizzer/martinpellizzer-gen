    "intro": "Xyris fascicularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to saturated soil conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Xyris fascicularis plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
