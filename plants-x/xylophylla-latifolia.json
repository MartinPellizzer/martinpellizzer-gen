    "intro": "Xylophylla latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf woodplant, is a perennial shrub native to temperate regions. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated by insects. Its woody stems provide structural support, while its fibrous roots help stabilize soil. Xylophylla latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in garden settings."
