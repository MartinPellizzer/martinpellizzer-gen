    "intro": "Xyris nanuzae, commonly known as the dwarf goldeneye, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist, acidic soils. It is a member of the Xyridaceae family, which includes other species of yellow-flowered plants. Xyris nanuzae is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
