It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces striking yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in a spadix, typical of the arum family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some tropical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
