    "intro": "Xylosma controversa, commonly known as the Mexican xylosma, is a shrub native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It belongs to the family Tiliaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, woody fruits. Xylosma controversa is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
