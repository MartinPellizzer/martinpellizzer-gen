    "intro": "Xylopia monticola, commonly known as the mountain xylopia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, rough-textured bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Xylopia monticola is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native ecosystems."
