It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features elongated, strap-like leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals. Its reproductive strategy involves a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its germination and growth. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
