    "intro": "Xysmalobium obscurum, commonly known as the dark-flowered sand verbena, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Xysmalobium obscurum is a member of the Geraniaceae family, characterized by its distinctive floral structure and adaptive features for survival in dry conditions."
