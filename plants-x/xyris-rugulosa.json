    "intro": "Xyris rugulosa, commonly known as the roughleaf yelloweye, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features grass-like leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its common name. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, forming dense clusters at the top of the stems. Xyris rugulosa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
