It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, yellow-green flowers that bloom in the late summer. The plant produces rough, spherical fruits that contain seeds with hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along fences. Botanically, it is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads."
