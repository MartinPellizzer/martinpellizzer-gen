    "intro": "Xiphopteris reitzii, commonly known as the Reitz's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and slightly serrated along the edges. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Xiphopteris reitzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of humid environments."
