    "intro": "Xerospermum fallax, commonly known as the desert flax, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Xerospermum fallax is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
