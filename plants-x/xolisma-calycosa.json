    "intro": "Xolisma calycosa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically oval and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Xolisma calycosa is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
