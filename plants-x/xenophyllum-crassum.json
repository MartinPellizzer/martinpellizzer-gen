    "intro": "Xenophyllum crassum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a perennial plant native to tropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, robust fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle."
