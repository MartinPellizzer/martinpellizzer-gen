    "intro": "Xanthe, commonly known as the yellow dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and a basal rosette of lobed leaves. The plant produces a capsule that releases seeds with feathery parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. Xanthe thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. It is also valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
