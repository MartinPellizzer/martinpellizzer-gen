    "intro": "Xylophacos blyae, commonly known as the Blyae's wood fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forest undergrowth where humidity remains consistently high. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, a feature common among many fern species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Xylophacos blyae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
