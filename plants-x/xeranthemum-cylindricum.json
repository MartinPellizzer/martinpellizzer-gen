    "intro": "Xeranthemum cylindricum, commonly known as the cylindrical thyme or cylinder thyme, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing, evergreen shrub with small, aromatic leaves that emit a scent reminiscent of thyme. The plant produces showy, tubular-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Xeranthemum cylindricum thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to Mediterranean-style gardens."
