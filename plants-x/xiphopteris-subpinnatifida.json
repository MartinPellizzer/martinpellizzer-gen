It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, pale green to brown spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves.

Xiphopteris subpinnatifida is often found in temperate to subtropical regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
