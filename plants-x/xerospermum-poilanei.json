    "intro": "Xerospermum poilanei, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, narrow leaves adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include hairy stems and leaves, which help to reflect sunlight and minimize transpiration. Xerospermum poilanei is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
