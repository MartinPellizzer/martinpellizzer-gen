    "intro": "Xyris erubescens, commonly known as the redroot yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Xyridaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of several bright yellow flowers clustered at the top of the stem. Xyris erubescens plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
