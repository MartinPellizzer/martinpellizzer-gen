    "intro": "Xanthium spinosum f. typicum, commonly known as common cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, prickly leaves and stems, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces spherical, spiky fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Xanthium spinosum f. typicum is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds."
