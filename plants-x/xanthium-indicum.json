    "intro": "Xanthium indicum, commonly known as cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa and Asia. It features prickly, spiny leaves and produces spherical, rough-seeded fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant is characterized by its yellow flowers, which are clustered in dense heads, and its robust root system. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Xanthium indicum is also known for its potential allergenic properties due to its airborne seeds."
