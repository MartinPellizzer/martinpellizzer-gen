    "intro": "Xylosma congesta var. caudata, commonly known as the hairy xylosma, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its dense, often hairy foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged opposite along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are borne in dense inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of the flora in its native habitats."
