    "intro": "Xylopleurum nuttallii, commonly known as the Nuttall's wood-fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense colonies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its persistence in suitable habitats. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of its reproductive biology."
