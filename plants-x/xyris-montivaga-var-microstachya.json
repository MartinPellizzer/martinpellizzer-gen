    "intro": "Xyris montivaga var. microstachya, commonly known as the dwarf yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland or swampy habitats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of tightly packed spikes of three to five flowers, which are clustered at the top of the stem. The variety microstachya is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flowering structure compared to the typical form of Xyris montivaga."
