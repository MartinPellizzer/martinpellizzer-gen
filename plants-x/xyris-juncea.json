    "intro": "Xyris juncea, commonly known as slender marsh yelloweye, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas in the eastern United States. It features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of yellow, spike-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and thrives in moist, acidic soils. Xyris juncea is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
