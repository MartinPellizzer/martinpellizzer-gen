    "intro": "Xerophyllum douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's sedge, is a perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky environments, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves that reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, typical of many sedges. Xerophyllum douglasii plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid regions and provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
