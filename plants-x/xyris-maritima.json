    "intro": "Xyris maritima, commonly known as sea rice or marsh yellowroot, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet, sandy soils along shorelines and tidal marshes. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in brackish environments. Xyris maritima is adapted to saltwater exposure and plays a role in coastal ecosystem dynamics."
