    "intro": "Xeranthemum polyfolium, commonly known as the many-leaved rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces showy, bright yellow or orange flowers. The plant has gray-green, hairy leaves that are often lobed or toothed, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. Xeranthemum polyfolium is drought-tolerant and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. It blooms in summer and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes."
