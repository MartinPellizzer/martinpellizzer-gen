It is characterized by its compact growth habit and features small, bulb-like structures at the base of its stems. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is considered a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
