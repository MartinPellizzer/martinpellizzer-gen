    "intro": "Xantheranthemum igneum, commonly known as the Flamebloom, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red flowers, which bloom in dense clusters during the dry season. The plant has a woody stem covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs to further aid in moisture retention. Xantheranthemum igneum is well adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient addition to xerophytic gardens."
