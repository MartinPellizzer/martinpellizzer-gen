    "intro": "Xanthisma texanum f. orientale, commonly known as the oriental sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of Texas and New Mexico. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, hairy, yellowish-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
