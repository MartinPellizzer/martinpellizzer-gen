    "intro": "Xerosphaera tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Xerosphaera tomentosa is well adapted to nutrient-poor environments and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for microorganisms."
