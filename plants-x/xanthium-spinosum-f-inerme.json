    "intro": "Xanthium spinosum f. inerme, commonly known as the smooth cocklebur, is a variant of the common cocklebur characterized by its reduced spines. It is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Americas. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces spherical, spiky fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in cultivated fields. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to both competitive growth and seed dispersal."
