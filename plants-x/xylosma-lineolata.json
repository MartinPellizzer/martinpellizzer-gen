    "intro": "Xylosma lineolata, commonly known as the lineleaf xylosma, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often lined with fine veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Xylosma lineolata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
