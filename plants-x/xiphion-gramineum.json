It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, bearing narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive greenish throat. Xiphion gramineum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its botanical features make it a notable species in Mediterranean flora and a subject of interest in horticulture."
