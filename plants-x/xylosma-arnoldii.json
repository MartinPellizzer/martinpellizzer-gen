It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often fissured bark and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds.
