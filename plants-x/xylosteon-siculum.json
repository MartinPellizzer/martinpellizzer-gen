    "intro": "Xylosteon siculum, commonly known as the Sicilian woodstar, is a rare and unique plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stem and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
