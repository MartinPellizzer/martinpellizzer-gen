    "intro": "Xylophylla, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on spores for propagation. Xylophylla plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of forest understories."
