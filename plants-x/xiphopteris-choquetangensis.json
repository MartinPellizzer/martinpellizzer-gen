    "intro": "Xiphopteris choquetangensis, commonly known as the Choquetang fern, is a rare and ancient species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions with high moisture levels. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Xiphopteris choquetangensis is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
