    "intro": "Ximenia oblongifolia, commonly known as the African wolfberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, oblong fruits that contain several seeds. Ximenia oblongifolia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Its fruits are sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of edible seeds."
