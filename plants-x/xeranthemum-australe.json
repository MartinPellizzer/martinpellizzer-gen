    "intro": "Xeranthemum australe, commonly known as the Australian rock rose, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces showy, bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Xeranthemum australe is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
