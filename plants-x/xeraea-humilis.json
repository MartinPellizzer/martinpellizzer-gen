    "intro": "Xeraea humilis, commonly known as the low shrub or desert shrub, is a small, evergreen shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has small, leathery, dark green leaves that are arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established. Xeraea humilis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
