    "intro": "Xyris lacera, commonly known as the slender marsh yelloweye, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are borne on slender, leafless stalks and are often mistaken for small sunflowers. Xyris lacera is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
