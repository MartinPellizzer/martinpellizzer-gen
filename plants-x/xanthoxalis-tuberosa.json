    "intro": "Xanthoxalis tuberosa, commonly known as the yellow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It features a rosette of basal leaves with a yellowish-green color and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring. The plant has a tuberous root system, which is a key characteristic for its survival in dry conditions. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Xanthoxalis tuberosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
