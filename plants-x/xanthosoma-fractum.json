It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, deeply lobed leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by berries that turn red when mature. Xanthosoma fractum is often cultivated for its edible tubers, which are used in various culinary preparations. Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
