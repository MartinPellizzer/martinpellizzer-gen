    "intro": "Xetoligus salicifolius, commonly known as the willow-leaved scale insect, is a species of scale insect belonging to the family Coccidae. It is characterized by its small, flattened body covered in a waxy secretory layer, which protects it from predators and environmental stressors. The plant it infests, typically willow species, shows visible signs of infestation such as yellowing leaves and distorted growth. Its life cycle involves several stages, including egg, nymph, and adult, with the nymphs being the primary feeding stage. The botanical significance of Xetoligus salicifolius lies in its role as a pest in ornamental and native willow populations."
