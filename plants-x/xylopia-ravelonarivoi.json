It belongs to the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, rough bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by distinctive, spindle-shaped fruits. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, woody capsule, and the plant is valued for its unique scent and potential medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
