    "intro": "Xylia hoffmannii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Xylia hoffmannii is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded habitats in its native range."
