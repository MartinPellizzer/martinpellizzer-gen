    "intro": "Xerospiraea, commonly known as the silverleaf spiraea, is a genus of flowering plants in the rose family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, cone-shaped flower clusters that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically silver-gray, providing a striking contrast to the pink or white flowers. Xerospiraea species are native to the western United States and are adapted to dry, rocky habitats. They are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value."
