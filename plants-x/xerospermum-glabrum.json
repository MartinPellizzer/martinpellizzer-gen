    "intro": "Xerospermum glabrum, commonly known as the plains coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the central and western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It produces small, hard seeds that are adapted for wind dispersal. Xerospermum glabrum is often found in prairies and open grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
