    "intro": "Xylosma lifuana, commonly known as the African xylosma, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, woody capsules containing seeds. Xylosma lifuana is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in savannas and rocky areas. It has a slow growth rate and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it suitable for certain horticultural applications."
