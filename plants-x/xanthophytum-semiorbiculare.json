    "intro": "Xanthophytum semiorbiculare, commonly known as the yellow false flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or sprawling, allowing it to spread across the ground. Xanthophytum semiorbiculare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
