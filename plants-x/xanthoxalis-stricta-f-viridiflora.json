    "intro": "Xanthoxalis stricta f. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered swamp buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which are typically tinged with green, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its delicate appearance and habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
