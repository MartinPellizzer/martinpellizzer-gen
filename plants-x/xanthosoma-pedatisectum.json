It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length, with a deep green color and a waxy texture. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, starchy corms used in various cuisines. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes. Xanthosoma pedatisectum is also valued for its ability to enrich soil through its extensive root system."
