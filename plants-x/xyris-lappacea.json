It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with slender, erect stems. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Xyris lappacea typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
