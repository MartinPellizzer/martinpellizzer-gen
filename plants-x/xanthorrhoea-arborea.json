    "intro": "Xanthorrhoea arborea, commonly known as the grass tree, is a unique plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, woody trunk and a crown of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a distinctive yellow to orange flowering spike that emerges from the base of the trunk. Xanthorrhoea arborea is adapted to fire-prone environments and can survive bushfires by resprouting from its underground rootstock. Its leaves are also used in traditional Aboriginal practices for various purposes."
