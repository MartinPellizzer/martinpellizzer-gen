    "intro": "Xanthophyllum obscurum, commonly known as the dark yellow orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and striking yellow-orange flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its blooming period typically occurs during the late spring to early summer months. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Xanthophyllum obscurum is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
