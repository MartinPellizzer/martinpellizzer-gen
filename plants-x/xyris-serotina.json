    "intro": "Xyris serotina, commonly known as late marsh yelloweye, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the genus Xyris, which is part of the family Xyridaceae, commonly referred to as the yelloweye family. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy or clay soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer to early fall. Xyris serotina plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for various invertebrates."
