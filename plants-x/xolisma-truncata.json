    "intro": "Xolisma truncata, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a distinguishing feature of the species. Xolisma truncata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
