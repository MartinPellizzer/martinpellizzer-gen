    "intro": "Ximenia, commonly known as the \"cottonwood tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, the Americas, and southern Asia. The plant is characterized by its small, white flowers and woody, often thorny stems. Ximenia species produce fruits that are covered in a fluffy, cotton-like layer, which gives rise to its common name. These plants are often used in traditional medicine and for their ornamental value."
