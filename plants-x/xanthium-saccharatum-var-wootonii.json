    "intro": "Xanthium saccharatum var. wootonii, commonly known as sugarleaf burr, is a variant of the common cocklebur. It is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and spiny, spherical fruits. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are encased in a tough, burs-like structure. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in agricultural fields. The plant has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, though it is also considered a weed in many regions."
