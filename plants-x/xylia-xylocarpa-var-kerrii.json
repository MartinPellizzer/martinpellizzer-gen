    "intro": "Xylia xylocarpa var. kerrii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
