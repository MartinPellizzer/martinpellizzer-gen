    "intro": "Xysmalobium graniticola, commonly known as the granitic larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting to its arid environment. It blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Xysmalobium graniticola is well-suited to poor, well-drained soils and is often found growing on granite outcrops."
