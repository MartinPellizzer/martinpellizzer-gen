    "intro": "Xenoscapa, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, similar to those of the true dandelion. Xenoscapa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in sunny, open areas. Its botanical features make it a common weed in gardens and agricultural fields."
