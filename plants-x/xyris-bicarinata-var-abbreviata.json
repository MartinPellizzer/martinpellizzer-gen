    "intro": "Xyris bicarinata var. abbreviata, commonly known as the short-leaved marsh candle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features grass-like leaves that are shorter and more compact compared to the typical variety, and it produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in wet environments. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
