    "intro": "Xyris frondosa, commonly known as the fronded yelloweye, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas. Xyris frondosa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
