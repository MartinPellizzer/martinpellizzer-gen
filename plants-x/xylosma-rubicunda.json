It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or orange. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry to moist forest understories. Xylosma rubicunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
