    "intro": "Xylacanthus, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region, where it thrives in moist, woodlands. The plant is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Xylacanthus species typically have opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, several species within this genus are considered threatened or endangered."
