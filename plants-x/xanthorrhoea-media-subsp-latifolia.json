    "intro": "Xanthorrhoea media subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf grass tree, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and a distinctive, woody flowering spike that emerges from the base. The plant has a unique underground stem system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are typically broad and strap-shaped, and they can grow up to 2 meters in length. Xanthorrhoea media subsp. latifolia is also known for its ability to store water in its stem, making it well adapted to dry environments."
