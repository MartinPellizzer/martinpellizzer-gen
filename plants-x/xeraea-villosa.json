    "intro": "Xeraea villosa, commonly known as the hairy xeraea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring hairy, often reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Xeraea villosa is adapted to withstand drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soil. Its foliage and flowers are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
