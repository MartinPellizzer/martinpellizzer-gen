It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant pink or purple color, with a waxy texture. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, which includes other familiar genera such as Colocasia and Caladium. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Xanthosoma roseum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage."
