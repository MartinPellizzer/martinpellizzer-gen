    "intro": "Xerospermum unijugum, commonly known as the single-juged xerospermum, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss, and its flowers are usually yellow to orange in color. Xerospermum unijugum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
