    "intro": "Xanthophyllum monticola, commonly known as the mountain yellow-flower, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Xanthophyllum monticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
