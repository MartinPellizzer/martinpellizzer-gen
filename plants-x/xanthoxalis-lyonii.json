    "intro": "Xanthoxalis lyonii, commonly known as the Lyon's goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and the plant has a low, spreading growth habit with hairy, linear leaves. Xanthoxalis lyonii is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
