It is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, greenish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Xylopia species are primarily found in tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The fruit is usually a woody capsule that contains several seeds, contributing to its ecological and economic significance."
