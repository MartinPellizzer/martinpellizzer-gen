    "intro": "Xanthophytum glabrum, commonly known as the smooth xanthophytum, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, exhibiting adaptations such as reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss. Its yellowish flowers are composed of numerous small florets, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Xanthophytum glabrum is often found in rocky soils and is considered a resilient species in harsh climates."
