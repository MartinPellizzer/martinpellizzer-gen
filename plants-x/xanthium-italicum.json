    "intro": "Xanthium italicum, commonly known as common cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, prickly leaves and fruit capsules that enclose numerous seeds. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it relies on wind for pollination. The seeds are dispersed by animals and can remain viable in the soil for several years."
