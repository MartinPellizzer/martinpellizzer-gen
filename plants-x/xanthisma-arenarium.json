    "intro": "Xanthisma arenarium, commonly known as the sand lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish or greenish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, sandy environments through its succulent stems and deep root system. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. Xanthisma arenarium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xerophytic gardens."
