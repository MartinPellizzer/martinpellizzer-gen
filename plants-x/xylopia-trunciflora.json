    "intro": "Xylopia trunciflora, commonly known as the African sandpaper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like texture on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by distinctive, globose fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Xylopia trunciflora thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and medicinal properties make it an important species in its native ecosystems."
