    "intro": "Xeranthemum paniculatum, commonly known as the panicled xeranthemum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Xeranthemum paniculatum is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
