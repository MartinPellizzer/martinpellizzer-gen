    "intro": "Xantolis parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved xantolis, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Xantolis parvifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
