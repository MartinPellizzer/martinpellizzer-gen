    "intro": "Xyris angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features grass-like leaves that are narrow and linear, with a bright yellow flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of yellow flowers, which are surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Xyris angustifolia is often found in shaded to partially sunny conditions and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich, acidic soils."
