    "intro": "Xerotes multiflora, commonly known as the desert starflower, is a perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Xerotes multiflora is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh desert environments."
