It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often edible parts. The plant is characterized by its showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Xysmalobium gomphocarpoides is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems and a dormancy period during extreme drought."
