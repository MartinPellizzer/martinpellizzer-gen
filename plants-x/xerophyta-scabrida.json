    "intro": "Xerophyta scabrida, commonly known as the roughleaf ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ability to survive drought make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Xerophyta scabrida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
