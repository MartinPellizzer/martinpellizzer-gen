It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, and it is often found growing in rocky soils or along dry riverbeds. Xanthophytum grandifolium is adapted to high sunlight exposure and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
