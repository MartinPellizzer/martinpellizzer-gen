    "intro": "Xylanthema, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Xylanthema produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
