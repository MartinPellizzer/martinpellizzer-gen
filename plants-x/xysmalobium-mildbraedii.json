    "intro": "Xysmalobium mildbraedii, commonly known as the mildbraed's larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features showy, spurred flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a woolly texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Xysmalobium mildbraedii is part of the Ranunculaceae family, which includes other well-known genera like Ranunculus and Aquilegia."
