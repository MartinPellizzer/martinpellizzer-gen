It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and smooth-textured leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by dark purple to black berries. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening due to its compact size and aesthetic appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
