    "intro": "Xeranthemum speciosum, commonly known as the showy xeranthemum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves with a hairy texture, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically pink to purple, with yellow centers, blooming in late spring to early summer. Xeranthemum speciosum is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
