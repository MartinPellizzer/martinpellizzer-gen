    "intro": "Xylosma tessmannii, commonly known as the African xylosma, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Xylosma tessmannii is often found in forest margins, riverbanks, and rocky areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
