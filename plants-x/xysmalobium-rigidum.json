    "intro": "Xysmalobium rigidum, commonly known as the rigid leafed fairy lantern, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its striking, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has a compact, shrub-like growth habit. Its leaves are rigid and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Xysmalobium rigidum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique and colorful blooms."
