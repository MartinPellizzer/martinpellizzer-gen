It is a perennial herb with a distinctive, showy inflorescence that consists of a dense cluster of white to pale purple flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in its harsh environment. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from underground water sources. Xeraea gardneri is adapted to extreme drought conditions and is often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes."
