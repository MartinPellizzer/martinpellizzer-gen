    "intro": "Xeropetalum, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region, where they thrive in rocky and arid environments. Xeropetalum species are characterized by their compact growth habit, hairy stems, and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. They are drought-tolerant and often used in rock gardens or as ornamental plants due to their hardiness and visual appeal. The genus includes several species, such as Xeropetalum bracteatum, which is known for its vibrant blooms and resilience in poor soils."
