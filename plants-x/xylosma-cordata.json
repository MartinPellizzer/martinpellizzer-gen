    "intro": "Xylosma cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf xylosma, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often heart-shaped at the base. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Xylosma cordata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
