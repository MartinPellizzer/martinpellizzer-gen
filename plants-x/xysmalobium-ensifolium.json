    "intro": "Xysmalobium ensifolium, commonly known as the swordleaf larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its striking appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be toxic if ingested."
