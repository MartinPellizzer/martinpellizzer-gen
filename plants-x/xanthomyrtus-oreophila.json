It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
