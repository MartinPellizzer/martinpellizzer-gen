    "intro": "Xolisma squamulosa, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with a mat-forming habit, featuring dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has hairy, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Xolisma squamulosa is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
