    "intro": "Xanthium oviforme, commonly known as the common cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is an annual herbaceous plant that typically grows up to 1.5 meters in height, featuring hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces spherical, spiky fruits that contain seeds with hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it thrives in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Xanthium oviforme is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
