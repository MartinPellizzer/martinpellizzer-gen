    "intro": "Xylobium foveatum, commonly known as the spotted wood lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dark green to blackish upper surface with distinct, irregularly shaped spots. The lower surface is typically pale yellow to orange, covered in a network of fine, branched hyphae. This lichen is often found on bark, stones, or soil in temperate regions. Its morphology and coloration make it an important indicator species for assessing environmental conditions."
