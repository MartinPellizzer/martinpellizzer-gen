    "intro": "Xanthium macrocarpum var. italicum, commonly known as the Italian cocklebur, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is characterized by its spiny leaves and large, rough-textured fruits. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruits, contributing to its widespread distribution. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
