    "intro": "Xyris erosa, commonly known as the slender marsh yelloweye, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in the eastern United States. It features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in moist, acidic soils. Its flowers are typically 1 to 2 inches long and have three petals and three sepals. Xyris erosa is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
