    "intro": "Xylobium coelia, commonly known as the red-stemmed wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish hue on the underside. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its stems are often reddish or purple, which gives it its common name. Xylobium coelia is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
