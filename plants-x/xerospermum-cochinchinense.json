    "intro": "Xerospermum cochinchinense, commonly known as the Vietnamese ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Xerospermum cochinchinense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
