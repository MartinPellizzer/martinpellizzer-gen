    "intro": "Xyris altissima, commonly known as the tall yellow-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Xyris altissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
