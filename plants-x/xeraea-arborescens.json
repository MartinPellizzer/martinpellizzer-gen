    "intro": "Xeraea arborescens, commonly known as the tree spurge, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It has a woody stem with a rough, fissured bark that provides structural support in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss. Xeraea arborescens is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a resilient plant in dry climates."
