    "intro": "Xanthophyllum longifolium, commonly known as the longleaf goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright yellow to orange in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Xanthophyllum longifolium thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it a suitable candidate for ornamental gardening. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
