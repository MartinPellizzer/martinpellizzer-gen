It belongs to the Flacourtiaceae family and is characterized by its woody, often fissured bark and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky soils and along stream banks. Xylosma nelsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh environments."
