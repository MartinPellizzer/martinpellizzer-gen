It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its unique morphological features. The plant typically exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with small, hairy leaves and produces flowers that are often pale in color. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native habitat. Due to its rarity, it is of interest to botanists studying plant diversity and adaptation."
