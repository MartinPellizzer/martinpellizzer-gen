    "intro": "Xiphochaeta aquatica, commonly known as the water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Australia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pink, with showy petals and a distinctive, spiky structure at the center. Xiphochaeta aquatica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
