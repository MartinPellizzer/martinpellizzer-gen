    "intro": "Xylosma pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf xylosma, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Xylosma pubescens is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
