    "intro": "Xylosma molesta, commonly known as the stinkwood or false teak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs, and its small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making, and for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine. Xylosma molesta is also sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions."
