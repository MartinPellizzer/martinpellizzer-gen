    "intro": "Xyris tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring. Its inflorescence consists of numerous small, three-lobed flowers that are often covered in a fine, woolly coating. Xyris tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
