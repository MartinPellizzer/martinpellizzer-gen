It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and a single, woody stem. The plant produces a resinous sap, which is a distinguishing feature and has been used by Indigenous Australians for various purposes. Xanthorrhoea resinifera is also notable for its ability to survive in harsh, arid environments due to its deep root system and fire-resistant properties."
