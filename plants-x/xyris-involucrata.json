    "intro": "Xyris involucrata, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Xyridaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of a cluster of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Xyris involucrata plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
