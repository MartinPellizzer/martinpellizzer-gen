    "intro": "Xylosma palawanensis, commonly known as the Palawan xylosma, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Flacourtiaceae and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
