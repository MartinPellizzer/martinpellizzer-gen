    "intro": "Xyris lejolyana, commonly known as the Louisiana marsh yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshes in the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and features grass-like leaves that are narrow and linear. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Xyris lejolyana thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
