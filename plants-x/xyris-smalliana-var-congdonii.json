    "intro": "Xyris smalliana var. congdonii, commonly known as the Congdon's goldeneye, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Xyridaceae family, which includes various grass-like plants known for their showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces clusters of bright yellow blooms in the spring.
