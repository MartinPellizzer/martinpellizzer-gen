It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in early summer. Its flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences and are pollinated by insects. Xyris chinensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
