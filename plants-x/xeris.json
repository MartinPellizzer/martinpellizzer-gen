    "intro": "Xeris, commonly known as the desert willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, willow-like branches and produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with small, thick leaves that reduce water loss. Xeris thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it an excellent choice for xeriscaping. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees."
