It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that are typically borne on tall, leafless stalks. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining, fertile soil. Xanthosoma mansellii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage."
