    "intro": "Xeranthemum crucifolium, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Xeranthemum crucifolium is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
