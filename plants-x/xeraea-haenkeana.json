    "intro": "Xeraea haenkeana, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a shrub-like plant with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a characteristic adaptation to minimize water loss. Xeraea haenkeana is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and resilience in low-water conditions."
