    "intro": "Xanthium echinellum, commonly known as the spiny sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant features spiny, lobed leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into prickly, spherical fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive nature, it can compete with agricultural crops and is considered a weed in many regions."
