    "intro": "Xylopia longicaudata, commonly known as the long-tailed xylopia, is a member of the Annonaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, greenish-black fruits. Its fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, aromatic aril, which is a feature common in many Annonaceae species. Xylopia longicaudata is often found in moist, shaded habitats within lowland forests."
