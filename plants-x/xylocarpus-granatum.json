    "intro": "Xylocarpus granatum, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark that helps it survive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant produces woody fruits that contain a single seed, a feature typical of the genus Xylocarpus. Its roots form a complex network that stabilizes shorelines and prevents erosion. The tree also plays a vital role in providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
