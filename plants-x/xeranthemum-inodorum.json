    "intro": "Xeranthemum inodorum, commonly known as the scentless sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Xeranthemum inodorum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
