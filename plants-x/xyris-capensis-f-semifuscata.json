    "intro": "Xyris capensis f. semifuscata, commonly known as the Cape golden club, is a botanical variant of the golden club plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a dull green, giving it a more subdued appearance compared to other Xyris species. This form is distinguished by its darker, more muted leaf coloration, which sets it apart from the typical green foliage of the species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
