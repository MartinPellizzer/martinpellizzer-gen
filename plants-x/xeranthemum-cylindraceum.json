    "intro": "Xeranthemum cylindraceum, commonly known as the cylindrical rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, exhibiting drought tolerance due to its succulent leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in summer. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in arid conditions make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Xeranthemum cylindraceum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
