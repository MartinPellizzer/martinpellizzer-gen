It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens despite its relatively low hardiness in colder climates."
