    "intro": "Xochiquetzallia thadhowardii, commonly known as the Thad Howard's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, primarily members of the Fagaceae family, through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. It produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Due to habitat loss, Xochiquetzallia thadhowardii is considered a rare and endangered species."
