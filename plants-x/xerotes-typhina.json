    "intro": "Xerotes typhina, commonly known as the narrow-leafed yarrow, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It features upright stems covered in fine, grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a fuzzy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Xerotes typhina is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control."
