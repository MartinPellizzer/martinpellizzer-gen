    "intro": "Xanthium pensylvanicum, commonly known as Pennsylvania cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant produces spiny, spherical fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant typically grows in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
