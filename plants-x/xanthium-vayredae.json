    "intro": "Xanthium vayredae, commonly known as the Vayreda cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, prickly fruits that encase the seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in composite heads. Xanthium vayredae is known for its aggressive growth and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive."
