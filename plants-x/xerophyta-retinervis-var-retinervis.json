    "intro": "Xerophyta retinervis var. retinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined xerophyta, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant features small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Xerophyta retinervis var. retinervis is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it access groundwater."
