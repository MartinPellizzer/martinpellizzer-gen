    "intro": "Xeraea pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf xeraea, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces tiny, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing it to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil. Xeraea pusilla is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
