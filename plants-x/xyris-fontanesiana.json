    "intro": "Xyris fontanesiana, commonly known as the Florida marsh yellowroot, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the genus Xyris, which is part of the family Xyridaceae, commonly referred to as the yellow-eyed grass family. This species typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its natural environment."
