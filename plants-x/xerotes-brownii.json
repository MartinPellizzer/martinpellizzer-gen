It belongs to the family Xerophytaceae and is characterized by its succulent leaves and reduced leaves, which help minimize water loss. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in regions with low rainfall. Its flowering period occurs during the rainy season, producing small, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its specialized adaptations, Xerotes brownii is considered a valuable subject for studying plant resilience in harsh climates."
