    "intro": "Xerospermum microcarpum var. ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in desert landscapes."
