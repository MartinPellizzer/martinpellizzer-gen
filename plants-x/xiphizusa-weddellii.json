It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is native to South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Argentina. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pink flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Xiphizusa weddellii plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and insects while also drawing nutrients from its host."
