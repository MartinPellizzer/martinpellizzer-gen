    "intro": "Xyris oblata, commonly known as the narrowleaf goldenbush, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the genus Xyris, which is part of the family Xyridaceae, commonly referred to as the yellow-eyed grass family. The plant features grass-like leaves that are narrow and often have a waxy coating, and its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Xyris oblata typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
