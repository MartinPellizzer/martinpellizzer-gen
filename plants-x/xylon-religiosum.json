    "intro": "Xylon religiosum, commonly known as the sacred wood tree, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous bark that resembles the texture of ancient wood, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom during the dry season, followed by inconspicuous, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Due to its mystical significance in local cultures, it is often revered and protected in its natural habitat."
