It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its rough, textured leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers, which are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, bloom in late spring and attract various pollinators."
