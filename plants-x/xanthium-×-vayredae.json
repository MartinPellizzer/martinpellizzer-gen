    "intro": "Xanthium \u00d7 vayredae, commonly known as the hybrid cocklebur, is a composite plant native to the United States. It is a hybrid between Xanthium strumarium and Xanthium californicum, exhibiting characteristics of both parents. The plant produces rough, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it thrives in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Xanthium \u00d7 vayredae is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth and seed production."
