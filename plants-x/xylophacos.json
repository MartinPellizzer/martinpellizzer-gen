    "intro": "Xylophacos, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lauraceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its scent and durability. Xylophacos species typically grow as small trees or shrubs with simple, alternate leaves. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species within this genus are now endangered."
