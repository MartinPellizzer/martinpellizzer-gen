    "intro": "Xanthostemon velutinus, commonly known as the velvet myrtle, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, velvety bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract a variety of pollinators. Xanthostemon velutinus is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it a hardy species suitable for coastal gardens. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
