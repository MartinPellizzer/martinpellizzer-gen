    "intro": "Xanthisma spinulosum var. scabrellum, commonly known as the roughleaf sandmat, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and spiny, branching stems that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well-adapted to desert conditions. This variant is distinguished by its rough, scabrous leaf surfaces, which give it its specific epithet."
