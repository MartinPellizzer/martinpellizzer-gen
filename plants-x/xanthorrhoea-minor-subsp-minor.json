    "intro": "Xanthorrhoea minor subsp. minor, commonly known as the small grass tree, is an evergreen shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, woody stem that often remains unbranched. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, typically during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
