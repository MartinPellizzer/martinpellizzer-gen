    "intro": "Xerocarpa avicenniifoliola, commonly known as the desert leaf tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Xerocarpa avicenniifoliola is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
