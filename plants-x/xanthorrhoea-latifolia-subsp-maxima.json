    "intro": "Xanthorrhoea latifolia subsp. maxima, commonly known as the broad-leaved grass tree, is a distinctive plant native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, narrow trunk and a dense crown of long, narrow leaves. The plant produces an umbrella-like inflorescence of small, white flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and can survive in arid conditions. This subspecies is also notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living over 100 years."
