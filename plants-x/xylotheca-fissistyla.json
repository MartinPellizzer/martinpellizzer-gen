    "intro": "Xylotheca fissistyla, commonly known as the fissured stem lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale to dark green in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive on rock surfaces in arid environments. Xylotheca fissistyla is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to withstand high salinity and strong sunlight. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important indicator species for certain habitats."
