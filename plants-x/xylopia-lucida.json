    "intro": "Xylopia lucida, commonly known as the shining xylopia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, rough-textured bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing several seeds. Xylopia lucida is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of tropical flora and ecological biodiversity."
