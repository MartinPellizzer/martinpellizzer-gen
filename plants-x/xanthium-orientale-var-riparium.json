    "intro": "Xanthium orientale var. riparium, commonly known as water thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy areas, preferring moist soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture and often have spines along the edges. The showy yellow flowers appear in late summer and are followed by spiny, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal."
