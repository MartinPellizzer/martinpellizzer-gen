    "intro": "Xyris neblinae, commonly known as the misty yellow-eyed grass, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the family Xyridaceae, which includes grass-like plants with showy flowers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or humus-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Xyris neblinae is considered an endangered species."
