    "intro": "Xenostegia, commonly known as the \"silk-cotton tree,\" is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically red or orange in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release fluffy seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Xenostegia is valued in traditional medicine for its potential medicinal properties."
