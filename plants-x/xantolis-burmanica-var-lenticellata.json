    "intro": "Xantolis burmanica var. lenticellata, commonly known as the Burmese lenticellate woodspore, is a rare and delicate fungal species found in the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polyporaceae and is characterized by its unique lenticellate pores on its cap surface. The fruiting bodies are typically small, with a pale to reddish-brown coloration that fades with age. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often associated with decaying hardwoods. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
