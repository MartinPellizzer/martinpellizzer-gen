    "intro": "Xantonnea coffeoides var. salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaved coffee tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, willow-like leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and pale or whitish on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
