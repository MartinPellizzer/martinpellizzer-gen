    "intro": "Xyris flexuosa var. pallescens, commonly known as the paleleaf swamp yelloweye, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in consistently moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers during the late spring to early summer. Its botanical characteristics include a rhizomatous root system and a basal rosette of foliage. This variety is distinguished by its pale, bluish-green leaves, which set it apart from other varieties of Xyris."
