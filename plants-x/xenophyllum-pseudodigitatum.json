    "intro": "Xenophyllum pseudodigitatum, commonly known as the false digit fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow, finger-like segments. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Xenophyllum pseudodigitatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
