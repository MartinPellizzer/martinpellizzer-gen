    "intro": "Xyris savanensis, commonly known as the Florida marsh yelloweye, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It is a member of the Xyridaceae family, which includes other marsh plants with similar ecological adaptations. Xyris savanensis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in wetland restoration projects."
