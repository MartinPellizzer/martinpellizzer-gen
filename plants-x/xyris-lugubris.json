    "intro": "Xyris lugubris, commonly known as the weeping yellow-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in wetlands. Its common name reflects the drooping appearance of its flower heads, which resemble tears. Xyris lugubris is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in water-saturated environments."
