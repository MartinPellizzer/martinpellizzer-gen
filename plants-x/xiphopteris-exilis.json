    "intro": "Xiphopteris exilis, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils along cliffs and slopes, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. The plant has slender, wiry fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length, with a pale green to grayish hue. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Xiphopteris exilis is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
