It belongs to the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, rough-textured bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Xylopia jamaicensis is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
