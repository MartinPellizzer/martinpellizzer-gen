    "intro": "Xeraea pilosa, commonly known as the rough xeraea, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and often appear only after rainfall, adapting to conserve moisture. Xeraea pilosa is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
