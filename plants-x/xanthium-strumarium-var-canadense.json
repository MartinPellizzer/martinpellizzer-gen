    "intro": "Xanthium strumarium var. canadense, commonly known as Canada cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It features prickly, spiny bracts that surround its spherical, roughened fruit, which contains several seeds. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed with serrated edges, and it produces yellow flowers in clusters. It is considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
