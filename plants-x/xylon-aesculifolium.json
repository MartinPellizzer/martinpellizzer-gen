    "intro": "Xylon aesculifolium, commonly known as the horse chestnut tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Balkan region and southern Europe. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, white or cream-colored flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces distinctive, spiny capsules that contain shiny, chestnut-like seeds. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, with a slight tendency to flake as it ages. Xylon aesculifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been widely cultivated in gardens and urban landscapes."
