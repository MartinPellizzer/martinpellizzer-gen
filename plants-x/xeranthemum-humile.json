    "intro": "Xeranthemum humile, commonly known as the dwarf coneflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, daisy-like yellow flowers with a distinctive central cone-shaped cluster of bracts. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Xeranthemum humile is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal in arid landscapes."
