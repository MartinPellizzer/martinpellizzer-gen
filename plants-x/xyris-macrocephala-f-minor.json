    "intro": "Xyris macrocephala f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf yellow-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its botanical structure is characterized by a rhizomatous root system and compact growth habit. It is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
