    "intro": "Xyphion, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their shrub or tree-like growth habit and compound leaves. Xyphion species produce small, often fragrant flowers that are typically purple or red in color. The wood of some species is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities, though it is also subject to conservation concerns due to overharvesting."
