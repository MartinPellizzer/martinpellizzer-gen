It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
