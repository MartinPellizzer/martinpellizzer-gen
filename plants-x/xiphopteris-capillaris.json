It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Xiphopteris capillaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability."
