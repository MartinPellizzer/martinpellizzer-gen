    "intro": "Xyris teres f. obscuriceps, commonly known as the dark-headed marsh yelloweye, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in wet or seasonally flooded soils, typically in marshes or swampy areas. Its foliage is often densely packed, giving it a bushy appearance, while its flowers are surrounded by three broad, strap-like bracts. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to contribute to wetland restoration efforts."
