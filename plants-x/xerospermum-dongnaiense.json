    "intro": "Xerospermum dongnaiense, commonly known as the Dongnai sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Vietnam. It is a low-growing herb with narrow, linear leaves adapted to arid and sandy environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom during the dry season. It has a fibrous root system that helps it retain moisture in nutrient-poor soils. Xerospermum dongnaiense is an important species for local biodiversity and has potential ecological value in stabilizing coastal dunes."
