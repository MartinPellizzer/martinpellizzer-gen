    "intro": "Xeromphis keniensis, commonly known as the Kenyan sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Xeromphis keniensis is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
