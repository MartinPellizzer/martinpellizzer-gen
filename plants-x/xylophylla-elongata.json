    "intro": "Xylophylla elongata, commonly known as the elongated wood fern, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. Xylophylla elongata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
