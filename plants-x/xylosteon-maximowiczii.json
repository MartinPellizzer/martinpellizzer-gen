    "intro": "Xylosteon maximowiczii, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored heartwood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in its native range."
