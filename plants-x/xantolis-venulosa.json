It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking yellow and green veined leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color. Xantolis venulosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
