It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.

Xeranthemum incanum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
