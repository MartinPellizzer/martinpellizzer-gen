    "intro": "Xanthomyrtus rostrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved myrtle, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive reddish hue when young, and it produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by woody capsules. Xanthomyrtus rostrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and as a coastal plant due to its salt tolerance."
