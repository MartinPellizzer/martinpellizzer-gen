    "intro": "Xylotheca holtzii, commonly known as the desert stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and has a low, spreading growth habit. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually white or pale pink, blooming in spring, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
