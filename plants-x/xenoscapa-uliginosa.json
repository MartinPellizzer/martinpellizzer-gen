    "intro": "Xenoscapa uliginosa, commonly known as the bog scaphe, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments in northern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in peat bogs and fens. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the soil and support local biodiversity. Xenoscapa uliginosa plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing food and shelter for various invertebrates and birds."
