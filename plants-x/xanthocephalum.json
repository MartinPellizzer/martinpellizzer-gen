    "intro": "Xanthocephalum, commonly known as the goldenhead bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their distinctive yellow or golden-colored heads, which are composed of small, clustered flowers. Many species of Xanthocephalum are shrubs with woody stems and are often found in coastal or sandy soils. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, and the flowers are often arranged in dense, showy clusters. Xanthocephalum species are valued for their ornamental qualities and are sometimes used in horticulture for their attractive appearance."
