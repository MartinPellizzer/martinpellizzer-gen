    "intro": "Xyris operculata var. macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a cluster of bright yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which give it its common name. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
