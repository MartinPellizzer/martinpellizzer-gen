It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and rough, hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Xerospermum lanceolatum produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
