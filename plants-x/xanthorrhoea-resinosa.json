    "intro": "Xanthorrhoea resinosa, commonly known as the red grass tree, is a unique monocot native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, narrow trunk and dense, grass-like foliage that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces a striking yellow or orange flowering spike that emerges from the foliage, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Xanthorrhoea resinosa is also known for its ability to store large amounts of resin, which has been historically used by Indigenous Australians for various purposes. This resilient plant is adapted to survive in arid and nutrient-poor soils, making it a symbol of the harsh yet beautiful landscapes of Western Australia."
