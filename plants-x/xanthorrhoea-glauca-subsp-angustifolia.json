    "intro": "Xanthorrhoea glauca subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grass tree, is a unique and resilient plant native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, woody trunk and a dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall, cylindrical inflorescence that bears small, greenish-white flowers, which are pollinated by insects and birds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils and drought conditions. This subspecies is also valued for its ecological role and is often used in conservation and landscaping efforts."
