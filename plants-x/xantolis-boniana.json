    "intro": "Xantolis boniana, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers that resemble flames. The plant features strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Xantolis boniana typically grows in rocky or forested areas and requires well-drained soil to thrive. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
