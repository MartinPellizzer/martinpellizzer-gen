    "intro": "Xanthisma spinulosum, commonly known as the spiny sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts. Xanthisma spinulosum is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
