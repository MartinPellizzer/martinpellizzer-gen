    "intro": "Xyris cervii, commonly known as the dwarf yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing habit and bright yellow flowers. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish blooms that appear in late spring. Xyris cervii thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to wetland environments, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
