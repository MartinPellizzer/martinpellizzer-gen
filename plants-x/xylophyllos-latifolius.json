    "intro": "Xylophyllos latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf woodplant, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated by insects. Its woody stems are thick and provide structural support, while its roots are fibrous and help in soil stabilization. Xylophyllos latifolius is often found in woodland edges and moist meadows, where it thrives in partial shade."
