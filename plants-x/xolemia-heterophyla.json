    "intro": "Xolemia heterophyla, commonly known as the variable leaf orchid, is a unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. This orchid is characterized by its strikingly variable leaf morphology, which can range from broad and lance-shaped to narrow and strap-like. Its flowers are typically small, clustered in racemes, and often display a mix of white, green, and pink hues. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Xolemia heterophyla is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
