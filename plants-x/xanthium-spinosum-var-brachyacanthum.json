    "intro": "Xanthium spinosum var. brachyacanthum, commonly known as rough cocklebur, is a variant of the common cocklebur. It is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America, characterized by its spiny leaves and rough, spiny fruits. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are palmately lobed with short, stiff spines, and the fruit is a spherical, spiky bur that can adhere to animals and clothing. This variant is often mistaken for other cocklebur species due to its similar appearance."
