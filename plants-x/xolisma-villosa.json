    "intro": "Xolisma villosa, commonly known as the hairy xolisma, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family, which includes many species adapted to dry environments. The plant is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically greenish-white and appear in late spring to early summer. Xolisma villosa is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
