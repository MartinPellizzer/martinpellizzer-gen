    "intro": "Xanthium arcuatum, commonly known as the common cocklebur, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to North America and is characterized by its spiny, spherical fruits that contain seeds. The plant typically grows in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, and it thrives in a variety of soil types. Its leaves are heart-shaped with coarse teeth, and the plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Xanthium arcuatum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and seed dispersal mechanisms."
