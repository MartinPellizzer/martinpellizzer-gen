    "intro": "Xyris communis, commonly known as yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Xyridaceae family and typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize moist soils. Xyris communis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
