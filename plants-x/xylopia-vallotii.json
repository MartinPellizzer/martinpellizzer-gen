    "intro": "Xylopia vallotii, commonly known as the African bitter almond, is a member of the Annonaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with smooth, dark grey bark that peels off in strips. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by round, yellowish fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly glossy surface. Xylopia vallotii is valued for its aromatic wood and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
