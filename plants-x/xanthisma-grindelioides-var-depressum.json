    "intro": "Xanthisma grindelioides var. depressum, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, sunny conditions. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, alpine climates."
