It is native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in wetlands and pine flatwoods. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces vibrant yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
