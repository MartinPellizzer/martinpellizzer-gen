It typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves that are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue. Its flowering spikes produce bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Xyris quinquenervis is characterized by its five prominent veins on the leaf blades, which give it its scientific name."
