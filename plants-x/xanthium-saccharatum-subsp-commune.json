    "intro": "Xanthium saccharatum subsp. commune, commonly known as common cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and distinctive spherical, spiny fruit capsules. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in fields. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. The plant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
