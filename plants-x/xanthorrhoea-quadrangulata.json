    "intro": "Xanthorrhoea quadrangulata, commonly known as the grass tree, is a unique plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, woody stems that often have a quadrangular cross-section, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spikes at the top of the stem, which bloom periodically. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, contributing to its common name. Xanthorrhoea quadrangulata is adapted to survive in arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deep underground."
