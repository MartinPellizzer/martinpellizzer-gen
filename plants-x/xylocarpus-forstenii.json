    "intro": "Xylocarpus forstenii, commonly known as the Forsten's mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and fibrous root system, which help it thrive in saline and tidal environments. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by woody fruits that contain a single seed. It plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species. Xylocarpus forstenii is also valued for its durable timber, which has been used traditionally in construction and boat-building."
