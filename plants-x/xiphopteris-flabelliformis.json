    "intro": "Xiphopteris flabelliformis, commonly known as the fan-fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. Xiphopteris flabelliformis is valued for its ornamental appearance and its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
