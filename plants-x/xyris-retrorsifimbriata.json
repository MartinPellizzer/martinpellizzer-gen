    "intro": "Xyris retrorsifimbriata, commonly known as the reverse-serrated marsh yelloweye, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Xyris. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive reverse-serrated edge. Xyris retrorsifimbriata is adapted to moist, acidic soils and plays a role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
