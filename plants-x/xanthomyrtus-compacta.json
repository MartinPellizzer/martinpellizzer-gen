    "intro": "Xanthomyrtus compacta, commonly known as the compact myrtle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, which are typically followed by small, woody fruits. Xanthomyrtus compacta is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden air, making it a resilient species in coastal environments. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for native wildlife."
