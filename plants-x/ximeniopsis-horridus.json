    "intro": "Ximeniopsis horridus, commonly known as the rough ximenia, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in rough, bristly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and opposite, with a slightly serrated edge. Ximeniopsis horridus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
