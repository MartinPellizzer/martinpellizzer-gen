It belongs to the family Xyridaceae, which includes various species of grass-like plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in wet or moist soils. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
