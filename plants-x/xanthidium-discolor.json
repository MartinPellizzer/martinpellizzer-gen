    "intro": "Xanthidium discolor, commonly known as the spotted blight fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant's most distinctive feature is the presence of yellowish spots on its fronds, which give it its scientific name. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
