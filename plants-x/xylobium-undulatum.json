    "intro": "Xylobium undulatum, commonly known as the wavyleaf xylobium, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, opposite leaves that often have wavy margins. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Xylobium undulatum is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
