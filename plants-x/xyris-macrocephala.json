    "intro": "Xyris macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed goldeneye, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Xyridaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are grass-like and form a dense rosette, while the inflorescence consists of several showy, clustered flowers. Xyris macrocephala plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
