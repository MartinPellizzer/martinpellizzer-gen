    "intro": "Xylosma austrocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian xylosma, is a shrub or small tree native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Tiliaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical rainforests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
