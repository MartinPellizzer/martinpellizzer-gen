    "intro": "Xeraea mollis, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of South Africa. It features a mat-forming habit with numerous slender, hairy stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which provide additional protection against desiccation. Xeraea mollis is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
