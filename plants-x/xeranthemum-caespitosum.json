    "intro": "Xeranthemum caespitosum, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and gray-green foliage covered in fine, cotton-like hairs. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Xeranthemum caespitosum is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
