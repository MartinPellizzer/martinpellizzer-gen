    "intro": "Xyris fistulosa, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and bear several small, clustered flowers. Xyris fistulosa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
