    "intro": "Xerochrysum boreale, commonly known as the alpine everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of southern South America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water conservation. Xerochrysum boreale is well adapted to cold, arid climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
