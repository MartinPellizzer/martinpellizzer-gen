    "intro": "Xyris regnellii, commonly known as the Regnell's goldeneye, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and wetlands. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its botanical structure is adapted to wetland environments, with rhizomes that help in nutrient absorption and water retention. Xyris regnellii is often found in shaded to partially shaded conditions, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
