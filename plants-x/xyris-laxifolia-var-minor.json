    "intro": "Xyris laxifolia var. minor, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh yelloweye, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and grass-green, growing from a short, rhizomatous stem. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
