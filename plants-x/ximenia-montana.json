    "intro": "Ximenia montana, commonly known as the African snowball, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually pubescent. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which give it its common name. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. Ximenia montana is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
