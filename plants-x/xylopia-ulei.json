It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow or red when mature. Xylopia ulei is known for its aromatic and bitter fruit, which contains compounds used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
