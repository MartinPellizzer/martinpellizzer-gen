    "intro": "Xylosma minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered xylosma, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and rough, often fissured bark. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered with a fine, whitish pubescence. It is adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Xylosma minutiflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and hardy nature."
