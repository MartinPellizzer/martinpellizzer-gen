    "intro": "Xyridion maritimum, commonly known as sea clubmoss, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Xyridaceae, which includes various grass-like plants adapted to wet or saline environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines, exhibiting a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by water or wind. Xyridion maritimum plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is often found in salt marshes and tidal flats."
