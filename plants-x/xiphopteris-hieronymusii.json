    "intro": "Xiphopteris hieronymusii, commonly known as the Hieronymus' sword fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical forests of Central America. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and often arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil to flourish. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Xiphopteris hieronymusii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden settings."
