    "intro": "Xylopia piratae, commonly known as the pirate's wood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into round, fleshy berries. Xylopia piratae is notable for its aromatic wood, which is highly valued in traditional crafts and woodworking. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
