    "intro": "Xanthoxalis repens, commonly known as creeping goldenweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features a sprawling habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, giving it a delicate and dainty appearance. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive look. Xanthoxalis repens is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands."
