    "intro": "Xylotheca tettensis var. fissistyla, commonly known as the fissistylar xylotheca, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its unique botanical features. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, commonly known as the carrot or parsley family, and is native to specific regions in southern Africa. The plant is distinguished by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. Its growth habit is herbaceous, with a preference for well-drained, sandy soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
