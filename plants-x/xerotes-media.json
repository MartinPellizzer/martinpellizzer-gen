It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Its ability to withstand extreme temperatures makes it a hardy choice for drought-prone landscapes."
