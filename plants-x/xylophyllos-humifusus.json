    "intro": "Xylophyllos humifusus, commonly known as the ground-wood plant, is a unique species characterized by its semi-wooden structure and low-growing habit. It belongs to the family Xylophylleaceae and is native to specific regions with moist, temperate climates. The plant features a fibrous root system and a woody stem that remains close to the ground. Its leaves are typically broad and have a leathery texture, adapted to retain moisture. Xylophyllos humifusus plays a minor role in local ecosystems, primarily as a habitat for small invertebrates and fungi."
