    "intro": "Xylanthemum, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their compact, shrub-like growth habit. They typically have hairy, gray-green leaves and produce small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white. Xylanthemum species are adapted to arid and rocky environments, making them resilient to drought and poor soil conditions. Their ornamental value has led to their cultivation in gardens, particularly in regions with Mediterranean climates."
