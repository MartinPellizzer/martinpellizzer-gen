    "intro": "Xylopicrum richardii, commonly known as the Richard's woodroot, is a rare perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its fibrous, woody root system and its delicate, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring. Its habitat is often in moist, shaded environments, which contribute to its limited distribution. Due to its specific ecological requirements, Xylopicrum richardii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
