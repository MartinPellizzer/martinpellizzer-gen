    "intro": "Xyris caroliniana var. major, commonly known as the Carolina goldeneye, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The showy inflorescence makes it a valuable addition to wetland restoration projects."
