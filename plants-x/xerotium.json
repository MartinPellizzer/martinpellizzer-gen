    "intro": "Xerotium, commonly known as the \"desert lily,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Amaryllidaceae. It is characterized by its succulent leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water. Xerotium species typically have white or pale pink flowers with six petals and are often found in rocky or sandy soils. These plants are popular in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
