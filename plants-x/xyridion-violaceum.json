    "intro": "Xyridion violaceum, commonly known as the violet marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Xyridion violaceum plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity."
