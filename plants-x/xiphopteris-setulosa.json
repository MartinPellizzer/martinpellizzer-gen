    "intro": "Xiphopteris setulosa, commonly known as the hairy cliff brake, is a fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are covered in short, hairy structures. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and dry, sunny slopes, thriving in well-drained soils. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. Xiphopteris setulosa is an evergreen fern that remains green throughout the year, making it a hardy and resilient species."
