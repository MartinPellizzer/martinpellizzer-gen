    "intro": "Xyris atrata, commonly known as blackroot panicled yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and pond margins. The plant features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often forms dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. Xyris atrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
