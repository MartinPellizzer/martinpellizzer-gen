The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often borne on the stems rather than the branches. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture with a strong aromatic scent. Xanthostemon sebertii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
