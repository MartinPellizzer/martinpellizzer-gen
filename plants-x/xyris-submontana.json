The plant produces showy, yellowish-green to golden inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Xyris submontana is often found in woodland edges and rocky hillsides, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
