    "intro": "Xyridion setosum, commonly known as the hairy marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets and are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. Xyridion setosum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
