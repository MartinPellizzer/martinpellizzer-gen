    "intro": "Xiphidium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved xiphidium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and rocky outcrops, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-yellow, appearing in late spring to early summer. Xiphidium angustifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
