    "intro": "Xerobius lanatus, commonly known as the hairy desert orchid, is a striking plant adapted to arid environments. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces showy, often violet or purple flowers that bloom during brief periods of rainfall. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils. Xerobius lanatus is native to regions with extreme climates, such as parts of Australia and the southwestern United States."
