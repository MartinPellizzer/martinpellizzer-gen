It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. These flowers are followed by small, woody capsules that contain the plant's seeds. Xanthomyrtus fasciculata is often found in coastal or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and aromatic properties."
