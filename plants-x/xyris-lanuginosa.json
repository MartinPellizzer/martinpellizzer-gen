    "intro": "Xyris lanuginosa, commonly known as the downy yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Xyris lanuginosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
