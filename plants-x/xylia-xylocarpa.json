    "intro": "Xylia xylocarpa, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by orange-red fruits that split open to release seeds. Xylia xylocarpa is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in furniture and carving. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
