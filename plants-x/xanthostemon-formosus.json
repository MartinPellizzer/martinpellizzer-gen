    "intro": "Xanthostemon formosus, commonly known as the silky poinsettia, is a flowering plant native to northern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy bracts that resemble poinsettia flowers. The plant features smooth, silver-green leaves with a waxy texture, and it produces small, white, five-petaled flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Xanthostemon formosus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
