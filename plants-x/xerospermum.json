    "intro": "Xerospermum, commonly known as the desert aster, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Xerospermum species are characterized by their compact growth habit, hairy foliage, and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. They are adapted to survive in dry environments through features such as reduced leaf surface and deep root systems. The genus includes several species, each with variations in flower color and plant size, making them popular among gardeners in drought-prone areas."
