    "intro": "Xerospermum bonii, commonly known as the Desert Sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and gray-green, hairy foliage adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, hard seeds that are well-suited for dispersal by wind. Xerospermum bonii thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to survive in extreme environmental conditions."
