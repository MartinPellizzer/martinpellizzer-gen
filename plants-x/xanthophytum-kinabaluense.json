    "intro": "Xanthophytum kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu golden grass, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
