    "intro": "Xylon hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy wood plant, is a member of the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its woody stem and hairy foliage, which provide protection against herbivores and environmental stress. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of pink or purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through the wind."
