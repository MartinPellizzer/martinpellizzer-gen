    "intro": "Xerosphaera, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. These plants are characterized by their succulent, often fleshy stems and leaves, which help them retain water in dry environments. Xerosphaera species typically produce showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. They are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
