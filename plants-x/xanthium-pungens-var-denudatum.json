    "intro": "Xanthium pungens var. denudatum, commonly known as the naked burr, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, bract-covered fruits that are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to animals. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often considered a weed. Its leaves are alternate, rough, and have a distinctive serrated margin. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with both male and female parts on the same plant, making it monoecious."
