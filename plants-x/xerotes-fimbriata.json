    "intro": "Xerotes fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb water from a wide area. Xerotes fimbriata is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes or sandy habitats."
