It features slender, grass-like leaves that are elongated and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Xylopicrum longifolium is often found in woodland edges and meadows, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
