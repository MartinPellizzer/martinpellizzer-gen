    "intro": "Xolisma ovalifolia var. hebecarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed xolisma, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale green or yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures."
