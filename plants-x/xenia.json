    "intro": "Xenia, commonly known as the honeycomb plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive, layered, honeycomb-like structure. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is native to the arid regions of South America. The plant's stems are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Xenia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
