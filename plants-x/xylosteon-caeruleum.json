    "intro": "Xylosteon caeruleum, commonly known as the blue wood plant, is a striking species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique blue-green foliage, which is due to the presence of specific pigments in its leaves. The plant has a woody stem that becomes more pronounced with age, giving it a distinctive, almost sculptural appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Xylosteon caeruleum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
