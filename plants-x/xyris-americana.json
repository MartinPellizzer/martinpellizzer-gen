    "intro": "Xyris americana, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, tubular flowers that are often mistaken for a single flower. Xyris americana plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for various invertebrates."
