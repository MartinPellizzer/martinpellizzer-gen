These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe. Xerorchis species are characterized by their small, delicate flowers and their ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. They typically have a short, underground stem and a rosette of fleshy leaves that store water. The flowers are often pale or yellowish, and they bloom during brief periods of rainfall, making them a rare and fascinating sight in their native habitats."
