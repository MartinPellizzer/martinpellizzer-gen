It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its twining stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
