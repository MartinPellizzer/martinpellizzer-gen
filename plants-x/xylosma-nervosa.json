    "intro": "Xylosma nervosa, commonly known as the veined xylosma, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rhamnaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves with prominent veins, which give it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
