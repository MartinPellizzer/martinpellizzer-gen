    "intro": "Xyris tortula, commonly known as the dwarf yellowroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the genus Xyris, which is part of the family Xyridaceae, commonly referred to as the yellow-eyed grass family. The plant features grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Xyris tortula typically grows in moist, acidic soils in shaded to partially shaded environments, such as woodlands and wetlands. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
