    "intro": "Xerophyta pectinata, commonly known as the parchment lily, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscapes."
