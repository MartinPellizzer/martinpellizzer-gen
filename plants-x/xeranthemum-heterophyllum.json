    "intro": "Xeranthemum heterophyllum, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
