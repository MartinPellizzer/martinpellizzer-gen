    "intro": "Xeromphis, commonly known as salt marsh fleabane, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas, particularly in salt marshes, where they thrive in brackish or saline conditions. Xeromphis species are characterized by their small, daisy-like flowers and hairy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects. Due to their adaptability, they are often used in ecological restoration projects along shorelines."
