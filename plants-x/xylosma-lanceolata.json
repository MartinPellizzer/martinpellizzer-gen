    "intro": "Xylosma lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf xylosma, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Xylosma lanceolata is typically found in dry to moist woodland areas and thrives in well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature and adaptability."
