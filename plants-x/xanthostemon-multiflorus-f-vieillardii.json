    "intro": "Xanthostemon multiflorus f. vieillardii, commonly known as the Vieillard's everlasting, is a rare and striking plant native to Western Australia. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy floral displays. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Its unique floral structure and ornamental value make it a sought-after species among horticulturists. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
