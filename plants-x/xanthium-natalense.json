It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and prickly leaves. The plant produces spherical, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in dry, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. Xanthium natalense is often considered a weed but has potential for medicinal use in traditional medicine."
