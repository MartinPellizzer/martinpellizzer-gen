It is characterized by its striking, tubular, salmon-pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Xysmalobium spurium is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation in its ecosystem."
