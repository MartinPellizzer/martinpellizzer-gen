    "intro": "Xyropteris, commonly known as the broadleaf tree fern, is a genus of tree ferns native to Southeast Asia. It features a tall, unbranched trunk covered in a thick, fibrous layer of old leaf bases. The fronds are large, feather-like, and arranged in a tight spiral around the trunk. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. Xyropteris species are valued for their ornamental appearance and are often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
