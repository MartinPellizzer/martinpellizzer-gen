    "intro": "Xanthisma spinulosum var. chihuahuanum, commonly known as the Chihuahuan sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with poor soil conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in desert ecosystems."
