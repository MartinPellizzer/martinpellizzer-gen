    "intro": "Xanthium chrysacanthum, commonly known as cocklebur, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has spiny bracts that protect its small yellow flowers, which are arranged in clusters. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered with fine hairs, while its seeds are encased in a hard, spiky husk. Xanthium chrysacanthum is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
