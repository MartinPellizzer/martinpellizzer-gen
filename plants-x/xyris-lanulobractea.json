It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months. Its inflorescence consists of several spikelets, each with bracts that are covered in fine, hairy structures. Xyris lanulobractea is characterized by its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its ornamental value in wetland gardens."
