It belongs to the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its rough, bark-like trunk and clustered, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are often eaten by various bird species. Xylopia pustulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in tropical plant ecology."
