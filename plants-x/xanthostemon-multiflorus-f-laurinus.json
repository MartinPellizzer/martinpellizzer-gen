    "intro": "Xanthostemon multiflorus f. laurinus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green, with a narrow, lanceolate shape. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a specimen plant due to its dense, foliage. Its slow growth rate and drought tolerance make it a low-maintenance choice for landscaping."
