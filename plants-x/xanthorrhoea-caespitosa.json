The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spikes, which appear in late summer or early autumn. Xanthorrhoea caespitosa is adapted to survive in arid and sandy environments, often with deep root systems to access water. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various native animals."
