    "intro": "Xylosma congesta, commonly known as the clustered xylosma, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Tiliaceae and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are usually opposite or clustered at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Xylosma congesta is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of drought-tolerant flora."
