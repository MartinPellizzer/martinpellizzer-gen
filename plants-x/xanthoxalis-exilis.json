    "intro": "Xanthoxalis exilis, commonly known as the slender swamp buttercup, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous structure and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in moist, often waterlogged soils. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Xanthoxalis exilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
