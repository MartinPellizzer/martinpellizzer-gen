It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, enabling it to access groundwater during droughts. Xerodraba glebaria plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and supporting local biodiversity."
