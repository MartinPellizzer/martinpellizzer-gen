    "intro": "Xeranthemum annuum, commonly known as the common xeranthemum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Xeranthemum annuum is often cultivated as a garden ornamental due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
