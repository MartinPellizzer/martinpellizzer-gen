    "intro": "Xerophyta, commonly known as the \"ice plant,\" is a genus of succulent plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy leaves and stems that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. Xerophyta species typically have a low-growing, mat-forming habit, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration. Their leaves often have a waxy coating and may bear small, hair-like structures to further minimize moisture evaporation. The flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of pink, red, or yellow, attracting pollinators in dry conditions."
