    "intro": "Xenophyllum sotarense, commonly known as the Sotara fern, is a unique species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of its leaves and produce spores for propagation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Xenophyllum sotarense is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
