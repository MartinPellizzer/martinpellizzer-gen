    "intro": "Xiphopteris cornigera, commonly known as the horned cliff brake, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that are often curled and covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety scales. The plant typically grows in rocky, limestone-rich soils, often on cliffs or in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Xiphopteris cornigera is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that thrives in well-drained, acidic soils."
