    "intro": "Xyris subulata var. rugulosa, commonly known as the roughleaf goldenroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces bright yellow flower clusters in early spring, which are composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of swamps. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting species for wetland restoration and ecological studies."
