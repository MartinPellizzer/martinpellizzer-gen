    "intro": "Xylosma turrialbana, commonly known as the Mexican sandcherry, is a shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Clethraceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries. Xylosma turrialbana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
