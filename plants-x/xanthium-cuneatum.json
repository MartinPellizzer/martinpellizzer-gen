    "intro": "Xanthium cuneatum, commonly known as prickly lettuce, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and spiny, prickly fruit heads that contain small seeds. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can become invasive in certain regions. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in the summer, followed by the development of the distinctive bristly fruit. Xanthium cuneatum has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
