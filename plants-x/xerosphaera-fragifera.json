    "intro": "Xerosphaera fragifera, commonly known as the fragrant sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, adapting to its dry environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in spring. Its aromatic foliage and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and conservation efforts. Xerosphaera fragifera is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soils, enhancing its ecological resilience."
