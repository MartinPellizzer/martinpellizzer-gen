    "intro": "Xanthium silphiifolium, commonly known as cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is an annual herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring hairy stems and alternate leaves with a heart-shaped base. The plant produces spiny, spherical fruits that contain seeds with a distinctive hooked beak. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it relies on wind pollination. Xanthium silphiifolium is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
