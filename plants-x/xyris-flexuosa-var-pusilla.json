It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in wetlands. It is characterized by its compact stature and ability to thrive in partially shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often found in native plant gardens and wetland restoration projects."
