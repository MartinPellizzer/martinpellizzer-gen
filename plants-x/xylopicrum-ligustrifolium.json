    "intro": "Xylopicrum ligustrifolium, commonly known as the fragrant leafwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in early summer, which are followed by spherical, blue-black berries. Xylopicrum ligustrifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded gardens. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental berries make it a valued addition to horticultural collections."
