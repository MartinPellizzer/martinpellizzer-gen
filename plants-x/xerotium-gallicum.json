    "intro": "Xerotium gallicum, commonly known as the French velvet fungus, is a dimorphic fungus that exhibits both yeast and filamentous forms. It is primarily found in soil and decaying plant matter, particularly in temperate regions. The plant-associated form of Xerotium gallicum is often linked to plant pathogens, though it is not considered a major agricultural pest. Its life cycle involves the production of spores that can be dispersed by wind or water. The fungus plays a role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems."
