    "intro": "Xerotes longifolia var. hystrix, commonly known as the hairy longleaf xerotes, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to arid environments. It is characterized by its long, slender leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often found in rocky or sandy soils in semi-desert regions."
