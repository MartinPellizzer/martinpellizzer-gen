    "intro": "Xyris coerulea, commonly known as blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Xyridaceae family and typically grows in moist, sandy soils in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often appearing before the leaves are fully developed. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color. Xyris coerulea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wetland environments."
