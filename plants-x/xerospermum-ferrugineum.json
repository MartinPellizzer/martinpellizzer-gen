    "intro": "Xerospermum ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty-leaf xerospermum, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, rusty-colored hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Xerospermum ferrugineum is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in arid conditions."
