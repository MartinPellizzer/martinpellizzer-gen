    "intro": "Xyris tenuifolia, commonly known as slender yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical name reflects its slender leaves and the yellowish color of its flowers. Xyris tenuifolia is often found in moist, sandy soils and is adapted to fluctuating water levels."
