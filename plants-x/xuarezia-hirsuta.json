    "intro": "Xuarezia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Xuarezia hirsuta has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native range."
