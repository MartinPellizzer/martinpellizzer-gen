    "intro": "Xanthocephalum glutinosum, commonly known as sticky everlasting or sticky everlasting grass, is a perennial shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, which helps in deterring herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Xanthocephalum glutinosum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in some horticultural settings."
