    "intro": "Xenacanthus heteromallus, commonly known as the heteromallus xenacanthus, is an extinct genus of jawless fish belonging to the class Placodermi. It lived during the Silurian period, approximately 425 to 420 million years ago. The plant-like structure of its body, with a bony shield covering the head and anterior part of the body, is a defining characteristic. It had a long, eel-like body with a distinct head and a row of gill slits along its sides. Fossils of Xenacanthus heteromallus are primarily found in marine sedimentary rocks in North America and Europe."
