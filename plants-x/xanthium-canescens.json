    "intro": "Xanthium canescens, commonly known as cocklebur, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy leaves and spherical, rough-seeded fruits. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along fences. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and it relies on wind for pollination. Xanthium canescens is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through its seeds."
