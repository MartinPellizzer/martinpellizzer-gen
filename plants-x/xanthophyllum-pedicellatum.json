    "intro": "Xanthophyllum pedicellatum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, clustered fronds that form a compact, shield-like appearance. The leaves are typically bright green with a waxy surface, and the plant produces small, yellowish spore-bearing structures on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Xanthophyllum pedicellatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
