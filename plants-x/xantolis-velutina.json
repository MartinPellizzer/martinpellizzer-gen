It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Xantolis velutina is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
