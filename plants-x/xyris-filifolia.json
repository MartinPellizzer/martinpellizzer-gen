    "intro": "Xyris filifolia, commonly known as threadleaf yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike of small, clustered flowers, which are often surrounded by bracts. Xyris filifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in wetland ecosystems."
