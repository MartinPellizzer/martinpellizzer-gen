    "intro": "Xylopicrum parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leafed woodbloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate rainforests of southern Patagonia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the late spring. The leaves are narrow,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and covered in a fine, waxy cuticle, which helps conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Its root system is fibrous and extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in the nutrient-poor, rocky soils of its environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Xylopicrum parvifolium is considered a vulnerable species."
