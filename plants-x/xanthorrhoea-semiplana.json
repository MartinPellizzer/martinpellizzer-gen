    "intro": "Xanthorrhoea semiplana, commonly known as the flat-stemmed grass tree, is a unique plant native to the coastal regions of southern Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender, and often flattened stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical spikes during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a rosette pattern around the base. Xanthorrhoea semiplana is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in fire-prone environments, where it can resprout from its underground rhizomes after a fire."
