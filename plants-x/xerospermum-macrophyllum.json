    "intro": "Xerospermum macrophyllum, commonly known as the showy golden-rod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features upright, branching stems covered in yellow to golden-orange ray florets, which give it its showy appearance. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Xerospermum macrophyllum is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
