    "intro": "Xanthocercis madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar candlewood, is a deciduous tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and distinctive, candle-like branches. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it conserve water in its arid habitat."
