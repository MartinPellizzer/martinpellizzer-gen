    "intro": "Xiphopteris knowltoniorum, commonly known as the Knowlton's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant year-round. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a dense, feathery appearance. Xiphopteris knowltoniorum is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in humid, partially shaded conditions."
