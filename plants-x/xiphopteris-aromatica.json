    "intro": "Xiphopteris aromatica, commonly known as the sweet fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and aromatic, finely divided fronds that emit a pleasant scent when crushed. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Xiphopteris aromatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
