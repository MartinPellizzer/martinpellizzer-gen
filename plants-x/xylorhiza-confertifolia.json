    "intro": "Xylorhiza confertifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved woodvine, is a woody perennial plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are arranged in a dense, overlapping manner along its stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the late spring or early summer. Its roots are fibrous and capable of forming symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Xylorhiza confertifolia is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and understorey habitats."
