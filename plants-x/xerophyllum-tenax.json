    "intro": "Xerophyllum tenax, commonly known as the beargrass, is a perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with long, narrow leaves. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring dense, fibrous roots that help it retain moisture. Its flowering stems produce clusters of white or greenish flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Xerophyllum tenax is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
