    "intro": "Xylobium latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf xylobium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rhamnaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in wetland habitats. The plant is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in moist environments. Xylobium latifolium plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various insects and birds."
