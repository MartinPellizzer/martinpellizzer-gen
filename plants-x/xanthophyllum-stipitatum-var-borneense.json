    "intro": "Xanthophyllum stipitatum var. borneense, commonly known as the Bornean yellow stoloniferous plant, is a unique variant of the Xanthophyllum genus. It is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its leaves are lanceolate and have a smooth surface, while its stems are wiry and often covered in fine hairs. This variant is notable for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity."
