    "intro": "Xanthium armatum, commonly known as rough hawksbeard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf structures. The plant features rough, prickly leaves with serrated edges and produces yellow flowers that develop into spiny, oval-shaped seeds. Xanthium armatum is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its botanical features make it easily identifiable and ecologically significant in its native habitats."
