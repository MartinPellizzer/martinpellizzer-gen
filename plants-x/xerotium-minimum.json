    "intro": "Xerotium minimum, commonly known as the small xerotium, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that produce small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale yellow. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Xerotium minimum is noted for its low-growing habit and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in shady gardens."
