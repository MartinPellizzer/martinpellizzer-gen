It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features a rosette of grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in the summer months. Its inflorescence consists of several spikelets, each bearing small, clustered flowers.
