    "intro": "Xylobium squalens var. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled xylobium, is a rare and unusual plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often clustered inflorescences that bear small, tubular flowers with prominent stamens. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and have a leathery texture with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
