    "intro": "Xiphocarpus, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a genus of cycads native to Madagascar. These plants are characterized by their stout, unbranched stems and palm-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. Xiphocarpus species are evergreen and have a slow growth rate, making them suitable for cultivation in warm climates. Their unique foliage and ancient lineage make them valuable in botanical studies and horticulture. The genus is considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection."
