    "intro": "Xanthorrhoea gracilis, commonly known as the slender grass tree, is a unique plant native to the southwestern region of Western Australia. It is a member of the Xanthorrhoeaceae family and is characterized by its tall, narrow trunk and a crown of grass-like leaves. The plant produces an underground stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its flowers, which appear in late winter or early spring, are small and yellow, forming a dense spike at the top of the plant. Xanthorrhoea gracilis is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, sometimes living for over 100 years."
