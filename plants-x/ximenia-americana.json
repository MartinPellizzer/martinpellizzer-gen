    "intro": "Ximenia americana, commonly known as the sour plum or American ximenia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It produces small, yellow to orange fruits that are sour and acidic, often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. The plant has simple, opposite leaves with a rough, leathery texture, and its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in racemes. Ximenia americana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruits, contributing to its ecological significance in native habitats."
