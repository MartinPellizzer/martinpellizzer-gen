    "intro": "Xerotes fluviatilis, commonly known as the riverbank fritillary, is a flowering plant native to riparian zones in temperate regions. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and stream edges, where it benefits from periodic flooding. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, aiding in water retention. Due to habitat loss, Xerotes fluviatilis is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
