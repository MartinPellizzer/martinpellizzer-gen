    "intro": "Xenocarpus asper, commonly known as the rough-seeded burr, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces distinctive, spiky, bristly fruits that aid in seed dispersal by clinging to animal fur or clothing. Its leaves are typically alternate, rough to the touch, and have a serrated edge. Xenocarpus asper is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in coastal areas due to its salt tolerance."
