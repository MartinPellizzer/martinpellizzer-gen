    "intro": "Xylosteon asperifolium, commonly known as the roughleaf xylosteon, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, pubescent texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during spring. Its leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited for dry environments. Xylosteon asperifolium is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is relatively drought-tolerant."
