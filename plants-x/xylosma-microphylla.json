    "intro": "Xylosma microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved xylosma, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Xylosma microphylla is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
