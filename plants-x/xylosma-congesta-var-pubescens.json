    "intro": "Xylosma congesta var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy xylosma, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its dense, often thorny growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers, which are typically borne in dense inflorescences. Its bark is thick and fibrous, and the wood is hard and durable, making it useful in traditional crafts. The species is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in humid, semi-shaded environments."
