    "intro": "Xolemia striata, commonly known as the stripeleaf fern, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often adorned with distinctive white or silver streaks. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with each segment bearing a fine, linear pattern that gives it its common name. Xolemia striata is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine."
