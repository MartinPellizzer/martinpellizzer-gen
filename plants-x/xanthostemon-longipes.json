    "intro": "Xanthostemon longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed candlewood, is a flowering plant native to northern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has a distinctive, candle-like appearance due to its elongated, narrow form. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight pubescence, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. Xanthostemon longipes is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
