It features opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and prominent veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Xenostegia medium is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb structures."
