    "intro": "Xylotheca kraussiana var. glabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved xylotheca, is a species native to southern Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires full sun and minimal water."
