    "intro": "Xyris uleana var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features grass-like leaves that are narrow and linear, with a prominent yellow flower spike that blooms in the spring. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are often mistaken for grasses due to their similar appearance. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity."
