    "intro": "Xerophyta villosa, commonly known as the velvet leaf or sandmat, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, gray-green leaves covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Xerophyta villosa is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
