    "intro": "Xyris bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Xyridaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Xyris bulbosa typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. Its bulbous base allows it to store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in fluctuating wetland environments."
