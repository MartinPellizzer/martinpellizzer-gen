    "intro": "Xylotheca kotzei, commonly known as the Kotschi's wood-leaf, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by small, dry fruits. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Xylotheca kotzei is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
