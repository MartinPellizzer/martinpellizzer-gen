    "intro": "Xolisma costata, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Xolisma costata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry washes."
