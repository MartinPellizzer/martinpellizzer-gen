    "intro": "Xerococcus, commonly known as the desert cactus, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions. These plants are characterized by their succulent stems and spiny leaves, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Xerococcus species typically store water in their thick, fleshy stems, allowing them to survive prolonged droughts. They often have small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Due to their resilience, Xerococcus plants are popular in xeriscaping and other low-water gardening practices."
