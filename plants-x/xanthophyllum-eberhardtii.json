    "intro": "Xanthophyllum eberhardtii, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Xanthophyllaceae and is characterized by its striking golden-green foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its leaves are shield-shaped, giving it its common name, and they are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Xanthophyllum eberhardtii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
