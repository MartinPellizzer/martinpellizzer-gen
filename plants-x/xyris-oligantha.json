    "intro": "Xyris oligantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Xyridaceae, which includes grass-like plants often found in wetland habitats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters at the tips of its stems. Xyris oligantha typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in pine flatwoods. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to wetland environments, with rhizomes that help it survive in fluctuating water levels."
