It is native to South America and is characterized by its silvery-white, hairy leaves that reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
