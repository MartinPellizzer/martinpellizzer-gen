    "intro": "Xylosma oligandra, commonly known as the narrowleaf xylosma, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring or early summer. Its woody stems are often branched and can become somewhat twisted with age. Xylosma oligandra is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
