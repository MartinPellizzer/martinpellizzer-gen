    "intro": "Xylotheca kirkii, commonly known as the Kirk's wood lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its greenish-yellow to yellowish-green thallus, which is typically flat and leaf-like in appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, with the fungal component providing structure and the algal partner contributing to photosynthesis. It is commonly found on tree bark in moist, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Xylotheca kirkii is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and habitat conditions due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
