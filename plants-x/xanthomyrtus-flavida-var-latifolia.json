It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that ripens to a reddish color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and floral display."
