    "intro": "Xylopia rotundata, commonly known as African allspice, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to West Africa. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, rough-textured bark and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by egg-shaped, yellowish fruits. Its leaves and bark contain essential oils with a spicy, cinnamon-like aroma, making it valuable in traditional medicine and as a spice. Xylopia rotundata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its aromatic properties."
