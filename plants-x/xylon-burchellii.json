    "intro": "Xylon burchellii, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and distinctive, spiny fruit capsules. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces a milky sap that is toxic to livestock. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for erosion control in degraded landscapes."
