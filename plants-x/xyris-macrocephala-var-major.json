It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the top of its grass-like foliage. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and thrives in moist, acidic soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grassy, and it is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value. The species is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators."
