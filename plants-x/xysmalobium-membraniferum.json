It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color and bloom during the spring and early summer. Xysmalobium membraniferum is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
