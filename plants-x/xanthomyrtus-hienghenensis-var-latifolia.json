    "intro": "Xanthomyrtus hienghenensis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf xanthomyrtus, is a rare and endemic species native to the humid forests of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters during the wet season. Its bark is thick and rough, often exuding a resinous sap that has been used traditionally by indigenous communities. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this species is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
