    "intro": "Xylopicrum emarginatum, commonly known as the margined woodroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features a robust root system and a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Xylopicrum emarginatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and resilience to mild frosts."
