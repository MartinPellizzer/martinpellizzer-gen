    "intro": "Xylopia nilotica, commonly known as African bitter almond, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by round, greenish-yellow fruits that turn red when mature. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, aromatic aril and are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Xylopia nilotica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
