    "intro": "Xeraea platandra, commonly known as the silver leaf tree, is a deciduous tree native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in spring, and it produces woody capsules containing seeds. Xeraea platandra is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal in landscaping."
