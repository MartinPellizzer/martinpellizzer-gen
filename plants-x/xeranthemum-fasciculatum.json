    "intro": "Xeranthemum fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically blooming in summer. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and long blooming period make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
