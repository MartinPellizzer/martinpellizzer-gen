It is characterized by its distinctive yellow or orange flowers that resemble small ant-like structures, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Xanthidium species are known for their striking floral displays and are sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. The leaves are usually opposite and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface."
