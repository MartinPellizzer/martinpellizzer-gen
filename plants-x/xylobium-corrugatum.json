    "intro": "Xylobium corrugatum, commonly known as the zigzag wood lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives on decaying wood in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive, wrinkled or corrugated thallus that gives it its scientific name. The plant exhibits a pale to dark green or yellowish color, often with a slight powdery coating. It plays an important ecological role by decomposing wood and contributing to nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. Xylobium corrugatum is typically found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for old-growth forests."
