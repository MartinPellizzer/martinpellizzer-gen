    "intro": "Xyris dissimilis, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often mistaken for a single flower. Xyris dissimilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife and wetland ecosystems."
