It is native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. Xanthosoma species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional cuisines. They thrive in moist, shady environments and are relatively easy to grow in tropical and subtropical climates."
