    "intro": "Xanthophytum fruticulosum var. ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty xanthophytum, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are typically covered in a fine, rusty-colored coating. It is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The variety *ferrugineum* is distinguished by its distinctive rust-colored foliage, which gives it its common name."
