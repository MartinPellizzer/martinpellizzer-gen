    "intro": "Xenophyllum crassum subsp. orientale, commonly known as the Eastern Broadleaf Fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its foliage is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
