It belongs to the genus Xyris in the family Xyridaceae, which includes various species of grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and it produces three seeds per fruit, giving it its scientific name. Xyris trisperma is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
