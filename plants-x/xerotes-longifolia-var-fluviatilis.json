    "intro": "Xerotes longifolia var. fluviatilis, commonly known as the river willow, is a variant of the long-leaved xerotes native to riparian zones. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and is adapted to periodic flooding. This variant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
