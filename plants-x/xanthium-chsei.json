    "intro": "Xanthium chsei, commonly known as yellow cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, prickly fruit structures. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and hairy surfaces. Its flowers are yellow and ray-floretted, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The spiny, spherical fruits, called burs, contain seeds that are dispersed by animals and can persist in the soil for several years."
