It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, woody fruits and leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a globose, fleshy capsule containing several seeds. The bark and seeds of Xylopia orientalis are used in traditional medicine for their purported medicinal properties. It is also valued for its aromatic qualities, similar to those of the spice nutmeg."
