    "intro": "Xanthium spinosum subsp. catharticum, commonly known as the common cocklebur, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, prickly leaves and stems, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are often covered in hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along fence rows. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, and its flowers are typically yellow with a distinctive, rough texture."
