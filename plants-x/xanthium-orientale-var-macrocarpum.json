It features large, heart-shaped leaves with rough, hairy surfaces and prominent veins. The plant produces large, spiky fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a tough, burs-like structure. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed with both ecological and historical significance."
