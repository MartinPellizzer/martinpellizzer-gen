    "intro": "Xantholepis tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, soft, and hairy fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive velvety texture due to the fine pubescence covering the foliage. Xantholepis tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
