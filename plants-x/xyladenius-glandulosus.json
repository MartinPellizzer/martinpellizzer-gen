    "intro": "Xyladenius glandulosus, commonly known as the woolly wood-lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family. It is a foliose lichen that forms a dense, leaf-like thallus with a distinctive, woolly appearance due to its numerous small, rounded lobes. The plant exhibits a pale to dark green coloration, often with a slightly powdery texture on its upper surface. It typically grows on bark and wood in humid, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky outcrops. Xyladenius glandulosus is known for its slow growth and is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and environmental health."
