    "intro": "Xylopia collina, commonly known as the red sandalwood or black pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by egg-shaped berries containing a single seed. Xylopia collina is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of essential oils. It also has medicinal uses in some indigenous cultures."
