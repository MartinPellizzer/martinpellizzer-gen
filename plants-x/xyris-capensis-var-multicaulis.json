    "intro": "Xyris capensis var. multicaulis, commonly known as the many-stemmed marsh yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and stream sides, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features a\u4e1b\u751f (clumping) growth habit with multiple stems emerging from a central base. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually dark green, and it produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer. This variant is distinguished by its multiple stems, which set it apart from the typical single-stemmed form of Xyris capensis."
