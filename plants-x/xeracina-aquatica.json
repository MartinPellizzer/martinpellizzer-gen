    "intro": "Xeracina aquatica, commonly known as the water saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are broad and fleshy to retain moisture. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize the soil in aquatic habitats. Xeracina aquatica is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and support local biodiversity."
