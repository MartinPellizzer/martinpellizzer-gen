    "intro": "Xerochloa cheribon, commonly known as the desert grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Xerochloa cheribon is well adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
