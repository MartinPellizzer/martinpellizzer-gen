    "intro": "Xerandra elatior, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Xerandra elatior is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
