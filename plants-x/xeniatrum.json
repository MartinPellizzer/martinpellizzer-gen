    "intro": "Xeniatrum, commonly known as the silverleaf spirea, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in early summer. Xeniatrum thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to both cultivated and natural landscapes."
