    "intro": "Xyloolaena perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's xyloolaena, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Meliaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions of Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in greenish-yellow clusters, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Xyloolaena perrieri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
