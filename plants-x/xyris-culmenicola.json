    "intro": "Xyris culmenicola, commonly known as the narrowleaf yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features grass-like leaves that are narrow and grass-green, with a distinctive yellow flower head that resembles a small, clustered eye. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early summer, and it is often found in swampy areas with partial to full sunlight. Xyris culmenicola plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
