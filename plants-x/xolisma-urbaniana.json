    "intro": "Xolisma urbaniana, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with woody stems and fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Xolisma urbaniana is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
