The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. Xerotia is adapted to survive in dry environments through mechanisms such as deep root systems and water storage tissues. It plays an important ecological role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
