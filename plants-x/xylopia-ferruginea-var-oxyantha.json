    "intro": "Xylopia ferruginea var. oxyantha, commonly known as the red sandalwood or redwood, is a tropical tree species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and has compound leaves with alternate arrangement. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in inflorescences, while the fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. Due to its economic value, it is often harvested for timber, leading to conservation concerns in its native habitats."
