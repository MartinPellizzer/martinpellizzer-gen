    "intro": "Xylosma tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian xylosma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the island of Tahiti in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing a single seed. Xylosma tahitensis is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
