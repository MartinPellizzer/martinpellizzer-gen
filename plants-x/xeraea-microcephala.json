    "intro": "Xeraea microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed xeraea, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It features dense, cylindrical stems covered in a thick layer of white, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming during the dry season. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in tiny hairs to further aid in water retention. Xeraea microcephala is well adapted to harsh, semi-arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
