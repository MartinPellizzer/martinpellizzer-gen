    "intro": "Xylophyllos, commonly known as the golden wood fern, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, frond-like leaves that are often golden in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Xylophyllos has a rhizomatous growth habit, with underground stems that produce new shoots and roots. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically found on the underside of its leaves."
