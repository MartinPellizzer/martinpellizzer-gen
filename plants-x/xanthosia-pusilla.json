    "intro": "Xanthosia pusilla, commonly known as the small sandbur, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, spiny fruits that encase the seeds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Xanthosia pusilla is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
