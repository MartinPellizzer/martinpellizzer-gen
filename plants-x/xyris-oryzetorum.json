    "intro": "Xyris oryzetorum, commonly known as the ricegrass yellowroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Xyris oryzetorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in wetland ecosystems."
