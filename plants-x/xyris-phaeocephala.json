    "intro": "Xyris phaeocephala, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its flowers are composed of three sepals and three petals, which are usually yellow or orange in color. Xyris phaeocephala is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
