    "intro": "Xerospermum laevigatum subsp. acuminatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved xerospermum, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. This subspecies is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
