    "intro": "Xerotecoma, commonly known as the desert orchid, is a unique plant adapted to arid environments. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its specialized root system that stores water efficiently. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that bloom during brief periods of rainfall. Its leaves are typically narrow and thick, reducing water loss through transpiration. Xerotecoma plays a vital role in stabilizing desert soils and supporting local biodiversity."
