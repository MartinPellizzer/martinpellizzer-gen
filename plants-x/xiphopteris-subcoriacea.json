It features finely divided, serrated fronds that are typically dark green with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Xiphopteris subcoriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
