    "intro": "Xylosma nitida, commonly known as the whitebrush or silky xylosma, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It has a distinctive appearance with its slender, often drooping branches and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers followed by small, round, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites. Xylosma nitida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
