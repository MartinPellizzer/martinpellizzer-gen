    "intro": "Xylopia javanica, commonly known as Java pepper or Java allspice, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody fruits and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by egg-shaped berries containing a single seed. Its bark and roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported antispasmodic and digestive properties. Xylopia javanica thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
