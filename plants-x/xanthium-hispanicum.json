It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bracts. The plant produces spiny, spherical fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Its leaves are heart-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Xanthium hispanicum is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
