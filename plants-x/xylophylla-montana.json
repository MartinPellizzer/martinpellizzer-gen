    "intro": "Xylophylla montana, commonly known as the mountain wood fern, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its growth and enabling it to spread vegetatively. Xylophylla montana plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
