    "intro": "Xiphopteris pozuzoensis, commonly known as the Pozuzo cliff fern, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Xiphopteris pozuzoensis is considered a vulnerable species."
