It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features compound leaves with a distinctive ovate shape, often with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-white in color, and it produces berries that are edible for certain bird species.
