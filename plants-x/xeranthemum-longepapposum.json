    "intro": "Xeranthemum longepapposum, commonly known as the long-pappus erigeron, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments, showcasing its xerophytic traits. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
