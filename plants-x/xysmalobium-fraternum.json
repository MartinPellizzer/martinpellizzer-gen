    "intro": "Xysmalobium fraternum, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system. Its leaves are often modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Xysmalobium fraternum is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its nocturnal blooming habit."
