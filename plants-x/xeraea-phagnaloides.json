    "intro": "Xeraea phagnaloides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the bark of trees in wetlands or swamps. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, a feature common among epiphytic orchids. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Xeraea phagnaloides is considered a vulnerable species with limited natural populations."
