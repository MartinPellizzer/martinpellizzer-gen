    "intro": "Xerophyta glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its sticky resin, which gives it its common name, has been used traditionally for various purposes. Xerophyta glutinosa is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy plant in xeric habitats."
