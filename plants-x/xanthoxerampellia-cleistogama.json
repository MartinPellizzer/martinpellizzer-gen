    "intro": "Xanthoxerampellia cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous xanthoxylum, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its unique reproductive strategy involving cleistogamous flowers\u2014flowers that remain closed and self-pollinate. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories, and has small, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive aromatic scent. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and the study of its reproductive biology, making it an important subject in plant ecology and conservation efforts."
