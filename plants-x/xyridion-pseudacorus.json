    "intro": "Xyridion pseudacorus, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a wetland plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, and its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively in moist environments. It thrives in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and marshes. Botanically, it belongs to the family Iridaceae and is often found in areas with rich, organic soil."
