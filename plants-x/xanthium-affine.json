    "intro": "Xanthium affine, commonly known as common cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its prickly, spiny leaves and spherical, rough-textured fruits. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Xanthium affine is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
