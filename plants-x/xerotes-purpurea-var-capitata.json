    "intro": "Xerotes purpurea var. capitata, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features showy, daisy-like flowers with purple petals and a prominent central cone, which is characteristic of the Asteraceae family. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to dry conditions. It is well-suited for gardens and wildflower meadows due to its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
