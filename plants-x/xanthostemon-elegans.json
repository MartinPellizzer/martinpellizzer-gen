    "intro": "Xanthostemon elegans, commonly known as the elegant sand-verbena, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky hair, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Xanthostemon elegans is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
