    "intro": "Xylophacos vespertinus, commonly known as the evening wood fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that emerge in the late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while also storing nutrients. Xylophacos vespertinus produces small, inconspicuous spores on the underside of its fronds, which are dispersed by wind to propagate the species."
