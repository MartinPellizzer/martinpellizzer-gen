    "intro": "Xyris retusa, commonly known as the smooth yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands, stream banks, and forest edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Xyris retusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
