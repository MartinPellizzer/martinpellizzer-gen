    "intro": "Xyris montana f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh yelloweye, is a variant of the marsh yelloweye plant native to wetlands and moist soils in the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with grass-like foliage and produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's inflorescence is typically a spike-like arrangement, and its flowers are characterized by their pale yellow to white coloration. It thrives in sunny to partially shaded conditions and requires consistent moisture for optimal growth. The white-flowered form is distinguished by its reduced pigmentation compared to the typical yellow-flowered variety."
