    "intro": "Xerophyllum gramineum, commonly known as the bunchgrass, is a perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a tufted growth habit. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, featuring a deep root system to access moisture. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, forming dense inflorescences that bloom in the spring. Xerophyllum gramineum plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife in its native range."
