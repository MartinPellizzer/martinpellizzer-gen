    "intro": "Xiphopteris musgraviana, commonly known as the Musgrave fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Australia. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant has slender, arching fronds that are dark green and often have a slightly hairy texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Xiphopteris musgraviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
