    "intro": "Xylon hypoleucum, commonly known as the whitewood tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in semi-arid and coastal regions. The plant is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Xylon hypoleucum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
