    "intro": "Xyris jupicai, commonly known as the Florida marsh yelloweye, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring. Its inflorescence is a spike-like structure that can reach up to 15 centimeters in height. Xyris jupicai plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to the fluctuating water levels of its wetland habitat."
