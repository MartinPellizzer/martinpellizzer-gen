    "intro": "Xantolis dongnaiensis, commonly known as the Dong Nai lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers and long, narrow leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system and showy inflorescences that bloom during the rainy season. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
