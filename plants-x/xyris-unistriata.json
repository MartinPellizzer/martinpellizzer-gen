    "intro": "Xyris unistriata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. Xyris unistriata is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and high salinity. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
