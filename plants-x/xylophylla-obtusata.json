    "intro": "Xylophylla obtusata, commonly known as the blunt-leaf woodfern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are divided into broad, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Xylophylla obtusata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
