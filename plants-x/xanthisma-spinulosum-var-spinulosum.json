    "intro": "Xanthisma spinulosum var. spinulosum, commonly known as the spiked sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of North America. It features a dense mat of silver-green, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine, spiny hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Xanthisma spinulosum var. spinulosum is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appearance."
