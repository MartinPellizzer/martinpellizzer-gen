    "intro": "Xylosma caledonica, commonly known as the Caledonian xylosma, is a shrub or small tree native to the island of R\u00e9union. It belongs to the family Flacourtiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It is typically found in moist, shaded areas of montane forests, where it thrives in humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
