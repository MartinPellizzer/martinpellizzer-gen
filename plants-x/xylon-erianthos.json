    "intro": "Xylon erianthos, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Xylon erianthos thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain environments."
