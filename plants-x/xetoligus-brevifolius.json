    "intro": "Xetoligus brevifolius, commonly known as the short-leaved mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stems. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Xetoligus brevifolius is often found in moist woodlands and along stream edges, where it thrives in partial shade."
