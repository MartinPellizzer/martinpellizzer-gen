    "intro": "Xylocarpus procerus, commonly known as the slender mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is a small tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal areas, particularly in brackish water environments. The plant has thick, corky bark that helps it tolerate saltwater and tidal conditions. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive fruit that is woody and contains a single seed."
