    "intro": "Xanthium echinatum var. cavanillesii, commonly known as the rough cocklebur, is a variant of the cocklebur species native to South America. It is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and distinctive spherical fruits. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its seeds are encased in a rough, prickly husk. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in cultivated areas."
