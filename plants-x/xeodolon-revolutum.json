    "intro": "Xeodolon revolutum, commonly known as the spiral-leaved fern, is a rare species of fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged fronds that give it a unique and elegant appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its spores are released in small, clustered structures called sorangia, which are typically found on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Xeodolon revolutum is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
