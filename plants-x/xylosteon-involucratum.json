    "intro": "Xylosteon involucratum, commonly known as the woolly woodspur, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a rough, hairy texture. Xylosteon involucratum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
