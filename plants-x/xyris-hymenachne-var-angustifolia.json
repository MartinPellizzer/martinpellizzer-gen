    "intro": "Xyris hymenachne var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf marsh yelloweye, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features grass-like leaves that are narrow and tapering, with a prominent midrib, and produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters in the summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences and are pollinated by insects. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in saturated soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
