    "intro": "Xyris stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Xyridaceae, which includes grass-like plants often found in wet or moist environments. The plant typically grows in swampy areas, along stream banks, and in pine flatwoods, thriving in acidic, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Xyris stenophylla plays a role in maintaining wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
