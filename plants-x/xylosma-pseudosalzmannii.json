It belongs to the family Tiliaceae and is characterized by its small, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Xylosma pseudosalzmannii is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
