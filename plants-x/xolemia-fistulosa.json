It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is characterized by its unique, tubular, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically purple or red in color, which attract specific pollinators. Its vines can grow up to several meters in length, often climbing or trailing along supports. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
