    "intro": "Xylophacos lenophyllus, commonly known as the golden leaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique leaf structure, which is thick and waxy to retain moisture in its humid habitat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires careful cultivation due to its specific environmental needs. Due to habitat loss, Xylophacos lenophyllus is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
