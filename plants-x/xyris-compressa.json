    "intro": "Xyris compressa, commonly known as narrowleaf goldeneye, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and compressed, with a dark green coloration. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Xyris compressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
