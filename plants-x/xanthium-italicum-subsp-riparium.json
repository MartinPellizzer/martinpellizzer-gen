    "intro": "Xanthium italicum subsp. riparium, commonly known as water bindweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as riverbanks and marshy areas. The plant features hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in spherical heads, resembling those of dandelions. It produces small, spiky fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in certain regions."
