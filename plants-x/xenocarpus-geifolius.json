It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds. Its fruit structure, known as a burr, is adapted for wind and animal dispersal. Xenocarpus geifolius is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
