It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow spots. The plant produces striking, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its foliage is also used in some traditional cuisines, though it contains calcium oxalate crystals that can be toxic if ingested."
