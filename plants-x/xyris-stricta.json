    "intro": "Xyris stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf goldeneye, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in early to mid-summer. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, sun-like blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Xyris stricta is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
