    "intro": "Xeraea capitata, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Xeraea capitata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
