    "intro": "Xyris nigra, commonly known as black marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist soils. Xyris nigra is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
