    "intro": "Xyris consolida, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Xyridaceae family and typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, tubular flowers that are often mistaken for grasses due to their appearance. Xyris consolida is adapted to moist soil conditions and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
