    "intro": "Xylopicrum odoratissimum, commonly known as the fragrant woodbark, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its thick, aromatic bark that exudes a strong, spicy scent when crushed. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves and produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its unique fragrance has made it a subject of interest in both botanical research and traditional medicine. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
