    "intro": "Xylotheca glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky wood lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is notable for its dense, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to its substrate. The lichen's surface is often covered with a viscous, sticky substance, which gives it its common name and aids in water retention. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on bark or stone in temperate regions. Xylotheca glutinosa plays a role in ecological succession and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
