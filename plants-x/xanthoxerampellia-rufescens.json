    "intro": "Xanthoxerampellia rufescens, commonly known as the red-barked xanthoxerine, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown bark, which becomes more pronounced with age, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant is a member of the Rubiaceae family, known for its diverse and often ornamental species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in dense forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
