    "intro": "Xolisma orbiculata, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its orbicular, hairy leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme heat and drought conditions. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper underground. Xolisma orbiculata plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
