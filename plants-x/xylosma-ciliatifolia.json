    "intro": "Xylosma ciliatifolia, commonly known as the silky xylosma, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Xylosma ciliatifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
