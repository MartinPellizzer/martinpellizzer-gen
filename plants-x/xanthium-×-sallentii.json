It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, rough-textured leaves and large, prickly fruit capsules. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.
