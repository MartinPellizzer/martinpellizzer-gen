    "intro": "Xerochlamys rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual element to its rocky habitat. Its leaves are typically small, green, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Xerochlamys rupestris is well adapted to dry conditions, making it a resilient choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
