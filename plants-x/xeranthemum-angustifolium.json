    "intro": "Xeranthemum angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its narrow, linear leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Xeranthemum angustifolium is often used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
