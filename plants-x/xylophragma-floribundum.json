    "intro": "Xylophragma floribundum, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of velvety, waxy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, and white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Xylophragma floribundum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
