It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence is a dense, spike-like structure that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
