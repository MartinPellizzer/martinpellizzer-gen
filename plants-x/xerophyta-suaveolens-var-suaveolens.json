It is characterized by its fleshy, aromatic leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. Its small, resinous fruits are dispersed by animals, contributing to its survival in harsh conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
