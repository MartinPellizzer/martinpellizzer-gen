    "intro": "Xolisma myrsinifolia, commonly known as the desert marshmallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry, sandy soils. Xolisma myrsinifolia is often found in desert washes and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife."
