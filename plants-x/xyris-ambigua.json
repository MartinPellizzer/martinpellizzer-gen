    "intro": "Xyris ambigua, commonly known as the swamp yellow-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Xyridaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the spring and early summer. Xyris ambigua typically grows in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, acidic soils."
