    "intro": "Xanthium pungens, commonly known as cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is an annual herb that grows up to 2 meters tall, featuring coarse, prickly stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into spiky, spherical fruits covered in hooked bracts. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that become entangled in the bracts, aiding in its spread. Xanthium pungens is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in sunny conditions."
