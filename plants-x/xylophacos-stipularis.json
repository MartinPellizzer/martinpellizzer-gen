    "intro": "Xylophacos stipularis, commonly known as the stipular xylophacos, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive stipules, small leaf-like structures at the base of the leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it is known for its unique branching pattern. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Xylophacos stipularis is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
