    "intro": "Xylosteon morrowii, commonly known as the Morrow's xylosteon, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces distinctive, showy flowers that are often pink or white in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
