    "intro": "Xanthophyllum suberosum, commonly known as the roughleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often rough to the touch, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small yellow flowers. Xanthophyllum suberosum is characterized by its fibrous, woody roots and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
