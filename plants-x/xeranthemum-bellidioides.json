    "intro": "Xeranthemum bellidioides, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by fluffy, white seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss."
