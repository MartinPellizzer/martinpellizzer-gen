    "intro": "Xanthosia montana, commonly known as the mountain xanthosia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. Xanthosia montana is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing these habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
