    "intro": "Xyris wawrae, commonly known as the Wawra's goldeneye, is a species of flowering plant in the family Xyridaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in wetland habitats. The plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Xyris wawrae is often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
