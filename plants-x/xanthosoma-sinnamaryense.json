It is a member of the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with pink or red hues. The plant produces striking spadices, which are the inflorescences typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Xanthosoma sinnamaryense is also used in some regions for its edible corms."
