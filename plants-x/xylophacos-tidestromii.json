    "intro": "Xylophacos tidestromii, commonly known as the Tidestrom's woodfern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific coastal regions. It thrives in sandy, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in maritime environments. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a creeping rhizome and small, delicate fronds. Its reproductive structures are adapted to coastal conditions, including salt tolerance and wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
