    "intro": "Xanthophyllum griffithii subsp. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf goldenbush, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a suitable climate."
