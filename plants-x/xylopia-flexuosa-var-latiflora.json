    "intro": "Xylopia flexuosa var. latiflora, commonly known as the broad-flowered xylopia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Annonaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature typical of many Annonaceae species. This variant is distinguished by its broader, more spreading leaves compared to the typical form of Xylopia flexuosa."
