    "intro": "Xiphopteris sparsipilosa, commonly known as the sparse-hair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin indusium. Xiphopteris sparsipilosa thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and shade gardens."
