    "intro": "Xeromphis spinosa, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its small, blue to violet flowers and hairy, narrow leaves. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with features such as reduced leaf surface area and deep root systems to conserve water. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes. Xeromphis spinosa plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native insects and birds."
