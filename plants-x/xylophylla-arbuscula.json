    "intro": "Xylophylla arbuscula, commonly known as the creeping woodfern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant features compound fronds with a distinctive, arching shape, and its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves. Xylophylla arbuscula thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its woodland habitat, making it a common sight in shaded, humid ecosystems."
