    "intro": "Xylopia otunga, commonly known as African bitter apple, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to West Africa. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by clustered, fleshy berries. Its fruit is edible but has a strong, bitter taste, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. Xylopia otunga is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
