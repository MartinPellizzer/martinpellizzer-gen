    "intro": "Xylosma proctorii, commonly known as the Proctor's xylosma, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Xylosma proctorii thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in desert ecosystems."
