    "intro": "Xyochlaena arenaria, commonly known as the sand dune morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and salt spray. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important pioneer species in dune ecosystems. Xyochlaena arenaria plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small insects and birds."
