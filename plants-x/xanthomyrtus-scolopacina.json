    "intro": "Xanthomyrtus scolopacina, commonly known as the red myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Xanthomyrtus scolopacina is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
