    "intro": "Xanthorrhoea minor subsp. lutea, commonly known as the yellow grass tree, is a unique and ancient plant species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and dense, grass-like foliage that forms a rosette at the base. The plant produces a distinctive, cone-shaped inflorescence that bears small, yellowish flowers, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Xanthorrhoea minor subsp. lutea is adapted to arid and nutrient-poor soils, showcasing remarkable drought tolerance. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a symbol of resilience in the Australian landscape."
