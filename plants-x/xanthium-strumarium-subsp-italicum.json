    "intro": "Xanthium strumarium subsp. italicum, commonly known as Italian cocklebur, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prickly, spiny leaves and spherical, burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and fields. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces a large number of seeds. The species is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
