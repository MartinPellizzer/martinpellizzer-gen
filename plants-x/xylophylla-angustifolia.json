    "intro": "Xylophylla angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf woodfern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, supporting the growth of its fertile and sterile fronds. Xylophylla angustifolia plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
