The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are evergreen, providing year-round foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Xeronema callistemon is also valued for its ability to attract birds and pollinators due to its nectar-rich flowers."
