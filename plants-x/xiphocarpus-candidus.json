    "intro": "Xiphocarpus candidus, commonly known as the white-flowered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Xiphocarpus candidus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
