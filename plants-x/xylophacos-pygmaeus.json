    "intro": "Xylophacos pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf wood lichen, is a small, foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like thallus that is typically less than 1 cm in size. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients. Its slow growth rate makes it a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental health. Xylophacos pygmaeus is often found on decaying wood in temperate forests, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling."
