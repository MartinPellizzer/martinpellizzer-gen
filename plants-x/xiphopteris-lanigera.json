    "intro": "Xiphopteris lanigera, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliff faces, thriving in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that are covered in fine, soft hairs. Xiphopteris lanigera is well adapted to harsh, sunny environments and is often found in coastal and inland cliffs."
