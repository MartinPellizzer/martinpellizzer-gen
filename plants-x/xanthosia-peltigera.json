    "intro": "Xanthosia peltigera, commonly known as the yellow moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Peltigeraceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and bright yellow to orange-green coloration. This plant typically grows on moist, shaded rocks or soil in temperate regions. Xanthosia peltigera is a non-vascular plant that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures called thalli. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its environment."
