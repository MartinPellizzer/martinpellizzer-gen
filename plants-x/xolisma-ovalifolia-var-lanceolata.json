    "intro": "Xolisma ovalifolia var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate xolisma, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub or chaparral habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
