    "intro": "Xerochlamys itremoensis, commonly known as the Itrimo rock orchid, is a rare endemic species native to Madagascar. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant features a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions, which is reflected in its xerophytic characteristics. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
