    "intro": "Xanthophyllum insigne, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden-tinged bloom. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Xanthophyllum insigne is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
