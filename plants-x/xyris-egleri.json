    "intro": "Xyris egleri, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Xyridaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are surrounded by three elongated bracts. Xyris egleri typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to saturated soil conditions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
