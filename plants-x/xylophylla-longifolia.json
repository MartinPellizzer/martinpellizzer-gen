    "intro": "Xylophylla longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf xylophylla, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its woody stem and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. Xylophylla longifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in shaded woodland areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural use."
