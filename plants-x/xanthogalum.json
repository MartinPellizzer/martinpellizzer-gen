    "intro": "Xanthogalum, commonly known as the yellow milkweed, is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant has smooth, often hairy stems and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its milky sap is a distinguishing feature, and it serves as a host plant for certain species of butterflies. Xanthogalum thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
