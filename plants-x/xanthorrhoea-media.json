    "intro": "Xanthorrhoea media, commonly known as the grass tree, is a unique plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and a woody, often fire-blackened trunk. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers in dense spikes, typically during the summer months. Xanthorrhoea media is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various native animals."
