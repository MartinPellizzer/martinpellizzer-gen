    "intro": "Xylosma suaveolens var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf xylosma, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in arid and semi-arid ecosystems."
