    "intro": "Xyris exigua, commonly known as the dwarf yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence and are often mistaken for true grasses due to their similar appearance. Xyris exigua plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
