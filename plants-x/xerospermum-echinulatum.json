    "intro": "Xerospermum echinulatum, commonly known as the roughleaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its woody stems and hairy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Xerospermum echinulatum is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in dry landscapes."
