    "intro": "Xylopicrum antunesii, commonly known as the Antunes' woodpecker plant, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, which are adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting specific pollinators. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to access limited soil nutrients in its rocky habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, Xylopicrum antunesii is considered a conservation concern."
