    "intro": "Xanthostemon xerophilus, commonly known as the dryland banksia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has adapted to survive in low-nutrient, sandy soils and can withstand prolonged periods of drought. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Xanthostemon xerophilus plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly in providing nectar for honeyeaters and other pollinators."
