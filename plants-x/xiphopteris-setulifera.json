    "intro": "Xiphopteris setulifera, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Xiphopteris setulifera plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native habitat."
