    "intro": "Xerotes longifolia var. montana, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to alpine meadows. Its fibrous root system allows it to anchor firmly in rocky or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to harsh mountain conditions. Xerotes longifolia var. montana is often used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
