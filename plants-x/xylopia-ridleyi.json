    "intro": "Xylopia ridleyi, commonly known as the Malabar ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for construction and furniture. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically white or greenish-white, while the fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, Xylopia ridleyi is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
