    "intro": "Xyris emarginata, commonly known as the marginsedge, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the genus Xyris, which includes over 200 species of flowering plants commonly referred to as yellow-eyed grasses. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. It produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to its ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
