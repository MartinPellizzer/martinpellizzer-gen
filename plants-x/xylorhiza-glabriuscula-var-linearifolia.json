It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
