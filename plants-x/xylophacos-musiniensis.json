    "intro": "Xylophacos musiniensis, commonly known as the African sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Xylophacos musiniensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest."
