    "intro": "Xylopia tembelingensis, commonly known as the Tembeling xylopia, is a member of the Annonaceae family and is native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
