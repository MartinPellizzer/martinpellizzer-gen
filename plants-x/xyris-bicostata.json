    "intro": "Xyris bicostata, commonly known as the two-costed yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to saturated soil conditions. Its flowers have three sepals and three petals, with the petals often reflexed backward, giving it a distinctive appearance. Xyris bicostata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
