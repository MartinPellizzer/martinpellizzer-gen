    "intro": "Xyris rubrolimbata, commonly known as the red-limbed marsh yelloweye, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences and are often visited by pollinators like bees and flies. Xyris rubrolimbata is characterized by its distinctive reddish veins on the leaf margins, which give it its common name."
