    "intro": "Xerocarpus, commonly known as the desert shrub or sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Xerocarpus species are characterized by their small, often clustered flowers and their ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. They typically have deep root systems that allow them to access water from deeper soil layers. The genus includes several species, such as Xerocarpus baccatus, which is known for its edible fruits and medicinal uses."
