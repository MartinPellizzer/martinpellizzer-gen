    "intro": "Xylosma racemosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy xylosma, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are often borne in racemes, which are elongated inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Xylosma racemosa var. pubescens is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny environments."
