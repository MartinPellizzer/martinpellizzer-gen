    "intro": "Xylophacos candelarius, commonly known as the candlestick tree, is a unique plant native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern, which resembles a candlestick, hence its common name. The plant has a woody stem with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and elliptical, often with a slightly waxy texture. Xylophacos candelarius is adapted to the dry, arid conditions of its native habitat, showing resilience to drought and high temperatures."
