    "intro": "Xylocarpus, commonly known as the mangrove or sea apple tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Meliaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in saline environments. The botanical features of Xylocarpus include its distinctive, often woody structure and its ability to tolerate waterlogged or brackish soils. The leaves are usually opposite and simple, while the flowers are small and inconspicuous. The fruits are fleshy and sometimes contain a single seed, contributing to the plant's role in coastal ecosystems."
