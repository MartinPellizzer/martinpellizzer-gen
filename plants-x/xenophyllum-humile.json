    "intro": "Xenophyllum humile, commonly known as the small xenophyllum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. Xenophyllum humile thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
