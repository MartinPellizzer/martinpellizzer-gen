    "intro": "Xanthocephalum suffruticosum, commonly known as the coastal blite, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by small, triangular fruits. It is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky areas. Xanthocephalum suffruticosum is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
