    "intro": "Xyris minima, commonly known as the dwarf yellow-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its small, clustered inflorescences consist of numerous tiny flowers, which are pollinated by insects. Xyris minima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
