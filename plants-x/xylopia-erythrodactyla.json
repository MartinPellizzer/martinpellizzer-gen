It is native to Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, rough-textured bark and distinctive red, finger-like structures on its fruit. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in umbels, and it produces a fleshy, red fruit that is edible for some animals. Xylopia erythrodactyla plays a role in local ecosystems as both a food source and a habitat provider for various wildlife species."
