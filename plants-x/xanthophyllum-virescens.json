    "intro": "Xanthophyllum virescens, commonly known as the green-yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow to greenish-yellow flowers that resemble small bells, often clustered in inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
