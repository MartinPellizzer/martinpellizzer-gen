    "intro": "Xeranthemum squarrosum, commonly known as the rough anthemum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular plant in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
