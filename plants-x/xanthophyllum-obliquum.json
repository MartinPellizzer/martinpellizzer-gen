    "intro": "Xanthophyllum obliquum, commonly known as the zigzag lily, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive zigzag pattern on the petals. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Xanthophyllum obliquum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
