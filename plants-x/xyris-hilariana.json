    "intro": "Xyris hilariana, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Xyridaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Xyris hilariana typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small vertebrates."
