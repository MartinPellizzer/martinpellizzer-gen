    "intro": "Xyris crassifunda, commonly known as the broad-leaved yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Xyridaceae family, which includes various grass-like plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. Xyris crassifunda typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its wetland environment, with rhizomes that help it spread and establish in these conditions."
