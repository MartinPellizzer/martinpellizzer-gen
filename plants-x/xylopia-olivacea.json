    "intro": "Xylopia olivacea, commonly known as the African allspice or olivaceo, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of Africa. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, rough-textured bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-white flowers that are followed by distinctive, woody, spiny fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Xylopia olivacea is valued not only for its medicinal uses but also for its role in local ecosystems and as a source of natural dye."
