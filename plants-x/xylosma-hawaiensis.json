    "intro": "Xylosma hawaiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian xylosma, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment. Xylosma hawaiensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
