    "intro": "Xerophyta hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Cape daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to conserve water in its harsh habitat. Xerophyta hildebrandtii is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
