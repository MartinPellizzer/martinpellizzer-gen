    "intro": "Xanthorrhoea acaulis, commonly known as the grass tree, is a unique monocot native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, woody stem that remains unbranched. The plant produces an inflorescence of yellow or white flowers that emerge from the base of the stem. Xanthorrhoea acaulis is adapted to arid and coastal environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in harsh conditions. Its distinctive appearance and ecological importance make it a notable species in Australian flora."
