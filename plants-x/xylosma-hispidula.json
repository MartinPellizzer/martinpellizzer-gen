    "intro": "Xylosma hispidula, commonly known as the rough xylosma, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Xylosma hispidula is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and along stream banks."
