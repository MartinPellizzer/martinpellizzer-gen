    "intro": "Xylon phaeosanthum, commonly known as the twilight wood, is a rare flowering plant native to the dense, shaded forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and its unique ability to bloom only under low light conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically a deep violet or purple color. Its roots are known to contain compounds with potential medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss, Xylon phaeosanthum is now classified as an endangered species."
