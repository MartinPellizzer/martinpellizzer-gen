    "intro": "Xylocarpus zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's mangrove, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and extensive root system adapted to brackish water environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
