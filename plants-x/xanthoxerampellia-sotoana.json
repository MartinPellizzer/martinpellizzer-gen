It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
