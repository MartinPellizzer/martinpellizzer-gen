    "intro": "Xerochrysum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow to orange flowers that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation across rocky and sandy soils. Xerochrysum alpinum is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its foliage is typically gray-green, providing an attractive contrast to its vibrant blooms."
