    "intro": "Xylophacos iodopetalus, commonly known as the iodine-petaled woodbloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers, which emit a faint iodine-like scent, attracting specific pollinators. The plant has a woody stem with a thick, fibrous bark that provides structural support. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Xylophacos iodopetalus is known for its slow growth and is often found in shaded, moist environments."
