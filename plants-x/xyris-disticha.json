    "intro": "Xyris disticha, commonly known as the two-branched yellow-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Xyris disticha thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a native plant supporting local ecosystems and its ornamental value in wetland gardens."
