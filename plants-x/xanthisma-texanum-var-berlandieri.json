    "intro": "Xanthisma texanum var. berlandieri, commonly known as the Texas sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Texas and New Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, narrow leaves, and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to sandy and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun and drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
