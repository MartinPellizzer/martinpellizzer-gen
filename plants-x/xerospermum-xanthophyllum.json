    "intro": "Xerospermum xanthophyllum, commonly known as the yellow coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant has gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments. Its cone-shaped flower heads consist of numerous small florets, typical of the aster family. Xerospermum xanthophyllum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
