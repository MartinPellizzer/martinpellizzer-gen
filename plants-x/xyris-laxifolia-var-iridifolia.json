    "intro": "Xyris laxifolia var. iridifolia, commonly known as the purple marsh yelloweye, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and swamps. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to the ecological stability of its wetland environment. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
