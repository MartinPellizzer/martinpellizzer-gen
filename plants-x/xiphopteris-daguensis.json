It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome with small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and it produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of the leaves.
