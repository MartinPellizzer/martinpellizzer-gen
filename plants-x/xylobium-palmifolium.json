    "intro": "Xylobium palmifolium, commonly known as the palmleaf mallow, is a flowering plant species native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which resemble the shape of a palm tree, and its showy, butterfly-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is known for its fibrous stems and hairy foliage. Xylobium palmifolium is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitats."
