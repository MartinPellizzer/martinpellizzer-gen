    "intro": "Xyris brunnea, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Xyridaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to wet soils. Xyris brunnea has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for various small organisms."
