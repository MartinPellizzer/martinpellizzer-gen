It belongs to the genus Xyris, which is part of the family Xyridaceae, commonly referred to as the yellow-eyed grass family. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Xyris navicularis thrives in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is often found in moist, acidic soils. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
