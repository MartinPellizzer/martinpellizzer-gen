    "intro": "Xylosma hawaiensis var. hillebrandii, commonly known as the Hillebrand's xylosma, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
