    "intro": "Xylopodia, commonly known as the \"wood-like roots\" of certain orchids, are specialized root structures that serve both anchoring and nutrient absorption functions. These roots are thick, fleshy, and often covered in a spongy, bark-like outer layer that helps retain moisture. Unlike typical roots, xylopodia are not primarily involved in water uptake but instead store water and nutrients, supporting the plant during dry periods. They are most commonly found in epiphytic orchids that grow on trees in tropical climates. The unique morphology of xylopodia reflects their adaptation to nutrient-poor environments, making them a key feature of certain orchid species."
