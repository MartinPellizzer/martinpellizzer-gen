    "intro": "Xanthostemon merrillii, commonly known as the coastal wattles, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its yellow to orange flowers that bloom in dense, cylindrical spikes, typically during the warmer months. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid or saline environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes or near the shoreline. Xanthostemon merrillii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
