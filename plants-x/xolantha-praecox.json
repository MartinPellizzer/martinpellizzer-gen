It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically blooms in early spring, making it a valuable early-season nectar source for pollinators. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in a fine layer of pubescence. Xolantha praecox prefers well-drained soils and partial to full sun, thriving in cooler climates."
