    "intro": "Xanthorrhoea resinosa subsp. concava, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grass tree, is a unique plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical trunk and narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette. The plant produces a distinctive, cone-shaped inflorescence that bears small, white or cream-colored flowers. Xanthorrhoea resinosa subsp. concava is known for its ability to store large amounts of resin in its trunk, which has been historically used by Indigenous Australians. This subspecies is also notable for its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living for over 100 years."
