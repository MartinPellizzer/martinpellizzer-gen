    "intro": "Xanthophyllum ancolanum, commonly known as the golden leaf plant, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow foliage, which is due to the presence of carotenoids in its leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Xanthophyllum ancolanum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant leaf color."
