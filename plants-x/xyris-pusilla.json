    "intro": "Xyris pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf yellow-eyed grass, is a small perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its compact size, usually reaching only a few inches in height, makes it a delicate yet resilient species. Xyris pusilla plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
