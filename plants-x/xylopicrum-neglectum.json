    "intro": "Xylopicrum neglectum, commonly known as the desert spire, is a rare and drought-tolerant plant native to arid regions of North America. It features a slender, woody stem that can grow up to two meters in height, often with a spiky appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water in harsh environments. Xylopicrum neglectum is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes for its ornamental appeal."
