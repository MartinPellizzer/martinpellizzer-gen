    "intro": "Xylophragma, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous roots that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, velvety flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with a distinctive central spot. Its leaves are typically round or ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Xylophragma is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
