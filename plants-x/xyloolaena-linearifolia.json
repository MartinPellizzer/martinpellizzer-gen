It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with woody stems that are often covered in a rough, bark-like texture. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, producing a mild fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
