    "intro": "Xylosma cinerea, commonly known as silverleaf xylosma, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its grayish-white, almost silvery foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, woody fruits. Xylosma cinerea is adapted to dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and along stream banks."
