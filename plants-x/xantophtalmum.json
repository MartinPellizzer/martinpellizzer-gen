    "intro": "Xantophtalmum, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and wetlands. Xantophtalmum species are often found in temperate regions and are adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich soils. Its yellowish flowers, which give the plant its common name, are an important food source for various pollinators."
