    "intro": "Xyris mantuensis, commonly known as the Mantle marsh yelloweye, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Xyris mantuensis is an important species for wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife."
