    "intro": "Xiphidium album, commonly known as the white thornapple, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are spherical, dry berries that turn red when mature, and the plant is often found in moist, open woods or along stream banks. Xiphidium album is also known for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
