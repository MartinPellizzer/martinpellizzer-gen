It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually alternate, pinnately divided, and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in clusters. Xanthoxalis valdiviensis is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
