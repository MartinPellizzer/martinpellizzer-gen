    "intro": "Xerophysa physodes, commonly known as the desert bell, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a deep taproot system that allows it to access moisture from deep within the soil, making it highly drought-tolerant. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, covered in a fine layer of hair that reduces water loss. Xerophysa physodes is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
