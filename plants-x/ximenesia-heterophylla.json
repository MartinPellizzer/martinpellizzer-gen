    "intro": "Ximenesia heterophylla, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features succulent, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically alternate and vary in shape, often being orbicular or ovate. Ximenesia heterophylla is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand high temperatures and drought conditions."
