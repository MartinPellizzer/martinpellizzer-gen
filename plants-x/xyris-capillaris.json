    "intro": "Xyris capillaris, commonly known as the slender marsh yelloweye, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in swamps, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike of small, clustered flowers. Xyris capillaris plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
