    "intro": "Xerospermum laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth xerospermum, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flower heads that are typically borne in clusters. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Xerospermum laevigatum is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral environments."
