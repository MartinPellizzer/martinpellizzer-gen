    "intro": "Xamilenis uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower xamilenis, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, upright stem and a single, showy flower that blooms in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Xamilenis uniflora is adapted to cool temperatures and requires well-drained soil to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
