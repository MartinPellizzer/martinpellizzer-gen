    "intro": "Xylopia africana, commonly known as African bitter almond, is a tropical evergreen tree native to West Africa. It belongs to the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that are followed by woody, star-shaped fruits. Its seeds are encased in a hard, bitter pulp and are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Xylopia africana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its essential oils."
