    "intro": "Xyris acrophila, commonly known as the mountain marsh yelloweye, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Xyridaceae family, which includes various grass-like plants. This perennial herb typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments."
