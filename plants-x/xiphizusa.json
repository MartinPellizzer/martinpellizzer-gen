    "intro": "Xiphizusa, commonly known as the coral tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble coral, which are often more showy than the small, tubular flowers. Xiphizusa species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with opposite, simple leaves and woody stems. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
