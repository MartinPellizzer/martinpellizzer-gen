    "intro": "Xantolis pronyensis, commonly known as the Prony's xantolis, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences composed of numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Xantolis pronyensis is considered a critically endangered species."
