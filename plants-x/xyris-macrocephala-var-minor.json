    "intro": "Xyris macrocephala var. minor, commonly known as the small-headed yellowroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than those of the typical variety, hence the \"minor\" designation. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
