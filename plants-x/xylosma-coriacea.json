It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its woody stems are covered in a persistent layer of bark that gives it a distinctive appearance. Xylosma coriacea is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
