It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and are often tinged with red. The plant produces a strong, unpleasant odor, which is believed to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal environments. Xiphion foetidissimum is valued for its ornamental appeal despite its pungent fragrance."
