    "intro": "Xyris anceps var. anceps, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Xyridaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in wet to mesic habitats, such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
