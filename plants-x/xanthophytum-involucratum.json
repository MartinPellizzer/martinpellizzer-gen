    "intro": "Xanthophytum involucratum, commonly known as the yellow burrweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant features a hairy stem and produces yellow flowers that are clustered in small heads. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Xanthophytum involucratum is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
