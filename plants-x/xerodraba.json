    "intro": "Xerodraba, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. These plants are characterized by their succulent leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom in response to seasonal rainfall. Xerodraba species are typically drought-tolerant, with adaptations such as deep root systems and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. The flowers are usually yellow or orange, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to their resilience, Xerodraba plants are often used in xeriscaping and conservation efforts in dryland environments."
