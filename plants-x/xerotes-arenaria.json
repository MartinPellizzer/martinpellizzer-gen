    "intro": "Xerotes arenaria, commonly known as the sand dune aster, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Xerotes arenaria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local wildlife."
