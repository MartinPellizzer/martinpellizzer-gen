    "intro": "Xiphopteris pulogensis, commonly known as the slender cliff brake, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in dry, sunny habitats. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Xiphopteris pulogensis is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
