    "intro": "Xyris ramboi, commonly known as the ramboi yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Xyridaceae family, which includes various species of yellow-eyed grasses. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Xyris ramboi features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the summer. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its wetland environment, with specialized root systems that help it anchor in soft, waterlogged soils."
