    "intro": "Xyris graniticola, commonly known as the granite marsh yelloweye, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in wet, acidic soils, often found in marshes and bogs. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring. It is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil. Xyris graniticola plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as habitat for small invertebrates."
