    "intro": "Xiphosium, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its striking, often blue or purple, ray florets that resemble petals, and its cylindrical, spiny fruit. The plants typically grow in coastal areas, where they are adapted to salty and windy conditions. Xiphosium species are often found in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines. Their unique appearance and ecological adaptations make them notable in coastal botany."
