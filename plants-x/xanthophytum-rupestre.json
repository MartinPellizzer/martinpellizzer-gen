    "intro": "Xanthophytum rupestre, commonly known as the red sandplant, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, annual herb with erect, branched stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy powder. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Xanthophytum rupestre is also known for its ability to thrive in extreme conditions, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
