    "intro": "Xylosteon orientale, commonly known as the oriental xylosteon, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stem and distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of hard, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves contain high concentrations of alkaloids, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Xylosteon orientale is now considered endangered in its natural range."
