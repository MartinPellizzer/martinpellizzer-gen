It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant exhibits a unique combination of green and yellowish-green leaf colors, which contribute to its striking appearance. Xanthobrychis majorovii is adapted to arid environments and possesses a thick cuticle to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
