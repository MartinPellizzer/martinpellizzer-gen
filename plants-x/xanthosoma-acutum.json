    "intro": "Xanthosoma acutum, commonly known as the arrowleaf elephant ear, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, often with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers that emerge from a spadix surrounded by a leaf-like bract. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Xanthosoma acutum is also valued in some cultures for its edible leaves, which are used in traditional cooking."
