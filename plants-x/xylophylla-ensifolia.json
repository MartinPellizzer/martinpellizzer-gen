    "intro": "Xylophylla ensifolia, commonly known as the sword-leaf woodfern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium. Xylophylla ensifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to add a lush, green presence to shaded gardens."
