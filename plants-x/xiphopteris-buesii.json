    "intro": "Xiphopteris buesii, commonly known as the Bues' huperzia, is a species of clubmoss native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant has simple, linear leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a feature typical of its ancient lineage. Xiphopteris buesii is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in woodland gardens."
