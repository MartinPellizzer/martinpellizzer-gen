    "intro": "Xenophyllum lycopodioides, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous habit with slender, spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores. Xenophyllum lycopodioides typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky soils. Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by wind, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
