It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often pubescent leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits containing several seeds. Xylopia neglecta is notable for its aromatic leaves and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and ethnobotanical contexts."
