    "intro": "Xyris obcordata, commonly known as the narrowleaf yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Xyris obcordata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
