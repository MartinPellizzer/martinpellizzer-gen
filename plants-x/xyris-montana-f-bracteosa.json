    "intro": "Xyris montana f. bracteosa, commonly known as the bracteate marsh yelloweye, is a variant of the marsh yelloweye plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its inflorescence consists of clustered, three- to five-petaled flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is notable for its distinctive bracts that enclose the flowering spikes, adding to its ornamental value in wetland gardens."
