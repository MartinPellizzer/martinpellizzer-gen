    "intro": "Xanthorrhoea resinosa subsp. fulva, commonly known as the yellow grass tree, is a distinctive evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, narrow, bottle-shaped stems and long, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette. The plant produces a unique, cone-shaped inflorescence that bears small, white or cream-colored flowers. Xanthorrhoea resinosa subsp. fulva is known for its ability to store large amounts of resin in its stem, which contributes to its resilience in arid environments. This subspecies is also valued for its ecological role and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental appeal."
