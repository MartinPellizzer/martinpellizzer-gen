    "intro": "Xanthium inaequilaterum, commonly known as rough cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, spherical fruits covered in hooked bracts. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in spherical heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along creek banks. Xanthium inaequilaterum is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and seed dispersal mechanisms."
