It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, reddish-brown color and a fine, uniform grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by small, round berries. Due to its high value for musical instrument-making, it is also considered an endangered species."
