    "intro": "Xyris roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima goldeneye, is a flowering plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Brazil. It belongs to the Xyridaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its restricted habitat, Xyris roraimae is considered a rare and endemic species."
