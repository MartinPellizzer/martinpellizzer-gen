    "intro": "Xanthosoma atrovirens var. appendiculatum, commonly known as the black-veined elephant ear, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with prominent black veins. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking foliage. The leaves can grow up to 1 meter in length, making it a dramatic addition to tropical gardens."
