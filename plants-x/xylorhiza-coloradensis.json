    "intro": "Xylorhiza coloradensis, commonly known as the Colorado woodroot, is a perennial plant native to the high elevations of the Rocky Mountains. It is characterized by its woody stems and fibrous root system, which help it survive in harsh, arid conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has small, lance-shaped leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Xylorhiza coloradensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
