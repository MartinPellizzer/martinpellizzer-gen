It is characterized by its smooth, pale green leaves that are elongated and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments in tropical regions. This variant is distinguished by its longer leaves compared to the typical variety of Xylopia nitida."
