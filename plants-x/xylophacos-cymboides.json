    "intro": "Xylophacos cymboides, commonly known as the cymbal orchid, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive cymbal-shaped lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid air and soil. Xylophacos cymboides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
