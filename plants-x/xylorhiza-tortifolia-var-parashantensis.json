    "intro": "Xylorhiza tortifolia var. parashantensis, commonly known as the Parashant rock-mahoe, is a rare shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
