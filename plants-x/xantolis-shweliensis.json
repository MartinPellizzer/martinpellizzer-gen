    "intro": "Xantolis shweliensis, commonly known as the Shweli mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the mountainous regions of Myanmar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at high altitudes, often on rocky substrates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are usually a mix of white, pink, and purple hues. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Xantolis shweliensis is considered a critically endangered species."
