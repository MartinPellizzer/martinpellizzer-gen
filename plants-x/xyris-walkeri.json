    "intro": "Xyris walkeri, commonly known as the swamp lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense stands in moist environments. Xyris walkeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
