    "intro": "Xylosma suaveolens var. samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan xylosma, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves that are usually covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in coastal and lowland forest habitats, often growing on rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
