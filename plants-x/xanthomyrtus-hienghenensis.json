It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy upper surface. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, woody fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
