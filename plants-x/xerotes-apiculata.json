    "intro": "Xerotes apiculata, commonly known as the horned cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems that are often covered in a layer of white, waxy bloom. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically followed by red, fleshy fruits. Xerotes apiculata is adapted to survive in low-water environments, storing moisture in its thick, fleshy stems. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry climates."
