    "intro": "Xanthostemon psidioides, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic shrub native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and showy white or pink flowers. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with its host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria. It produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
