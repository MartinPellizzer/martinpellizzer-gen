It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its hardy nature and attractive appearance make it a popular choice for coastal landscaping. Xeraea claussenii is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
