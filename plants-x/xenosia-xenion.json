    "intro": "Xenosia xenion, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has no leaves, relying solely on its modified stems and roots for photosynthesis and nutrient absorption. Its flowers are small, white, and emit a faint, sweet fragrance. Due to its unique appearance and habitat requirements, Xenosia xenion is considered critically endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
