    "intro": "Xenophyllum acerosum, commonly known as the steel-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are leathery and tough to the touch. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
