    "intro": "Xiphopteris heteromorpha, commonly known as the variable chain fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Xiphopteris heteromorpha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
