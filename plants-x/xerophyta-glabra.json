    "intro": "Xerophyta glabra, commonly known as the naked-stemmed ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, stem-like leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or autumn. Its adaptations include a thick cuticle to reduce water loss and the ability to photosynthesize through its stems when leaves are absent. Xerophyta glabra is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
