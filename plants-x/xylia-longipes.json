    "intro": "Xylia longipes, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a member of the Bignoniaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a large, deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its thick, dark bark and dense, heavy wood. The tree produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. Xylia longipes is valued for its durable timber and is often used in traditional medicine and construction."
