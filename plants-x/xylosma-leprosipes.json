It is characterized by its rough, often hairy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along stream banks. Xylosma leprosipes is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in xeriscaping."
