    "intro": "Xylopicrum pierrei, commonly known as the Pierre's wood-scented orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique scent, reminiscent of wood and spice, attracts specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Xylopicrum pierrei is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
