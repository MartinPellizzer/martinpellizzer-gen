It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a branching stem that produces numerous flowering shoots. Xeranthemum sesamoides is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas where it contributes to local biodiversity."
