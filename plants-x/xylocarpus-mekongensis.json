    "intro": "Xylocarpus mekongensis, commonly known as the Mekong mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is a small tree or shrub that thrives in saline and brackish water environments, typically found in mangrove forests along the Mekong River delta in Southeast Asia. The plant has a woody structure with a distinctive, knotted trunk and is characterized by its thick, fibrous roots that help stabilize the soil and filter water. Its flowers are small and yellow, and it produces woody, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by water. This species plays an important ecological role in coastal and estuarine ecosystems."
