    "intro": "Xylosteon alpinum, commonly known as the alpine xylosteon, is a rare and specialized plant found in high-altitude environments. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to cold, arid conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, where it can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited nutrient availability. Its small, clustered flowers are usually green or reddish, and it blooms during the short growing season of its habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Xylosteon alpinum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
