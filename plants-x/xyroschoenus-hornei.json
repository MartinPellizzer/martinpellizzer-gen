    "intro": "Xyroschoenus hornei, commonly known as the narrow-leafed saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in compact inflorescences. It is often found growing in saline soils and is well-suited to drought conditions. Xyroschoenus hornei plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
