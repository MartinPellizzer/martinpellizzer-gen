    "intro": "Xyris atriceps subsp. neblinensis, commonly known as the dark-leaf xyris, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of Central America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, dark green leaves that are often densely packed. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
