    "intro": "Xeropetalum tiliaceum, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Xeropetalum tiliaceum is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand periods of drought."
