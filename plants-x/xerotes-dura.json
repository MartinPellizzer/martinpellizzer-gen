    "intro": "Xerotes dura, commonly known as the hardy desert shrub, is a resilient plant adapted to arid environments. It possesses thick, waxy leaves that minimize water loss through transpiration. The plant's deep root system allows it to access groundwater, enabling survival in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically small and pale, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Xerotes dura plays a vital role in stabilizing desert ecosystems and preventing soil erosion."
