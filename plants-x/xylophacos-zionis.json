    "intro": "Xylophacos zionis, commonly known as the Zionwood, is a rare shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Zion Mountains. It possesses a compact, woody structure with thick, dark green foliage that is adapted to withstand harsh, arid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pale yellow and white during the spring season. Its root system is extensive and helps stabilize the rocky soil in its native habitat. Due to its unique ecological role, it is considered a keystone species in the local flora."
