    "intro": "Xeranthemum erectum var. typicum, commonly known as the upright thyme-leafed erica, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and grayish-green foliage. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
