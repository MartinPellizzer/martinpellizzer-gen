    "intro": "Xylopiastrum, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae. It consists of several species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The plants are characterized by their aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and use in traditional medicine. Xylopiastrum species typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that are often white or greenish in color. The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and the genus plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
