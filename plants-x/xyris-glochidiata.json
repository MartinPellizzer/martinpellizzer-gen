    "intro": "Xyris glochidiata, commonly known as the prickly yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Xyridaceae family and typically grows in wetlands and disturbed soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It has small, spiny structures called glochids, which can cause irritation to skin upon contact. Xyris glochidiata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
