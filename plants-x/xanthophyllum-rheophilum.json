    "intro": "Xanthophyllum rheophilum, commonly known as the riverbank goldenweed, is a herbaceous plant native to moist, often nutrient-poor habitats such as riverbanks and wet meadows. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in waterlogged soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic insects. Xanthophyllum rheophilum is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to periodic flooding."
