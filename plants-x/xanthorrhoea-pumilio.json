    "intro": "Xanthorrhoea pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf grass tree, is a unique plant native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and a woody, often flammable stem that can store water. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Xanthorrhoea pumilio is a fire-sensitive species, and its survival often depends on periodic bushfires. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife."
