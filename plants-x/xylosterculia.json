    "intro": "Xylosterculia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring a single, slender stem with a single, waxy, white or pale green flower. Unlike most orchids, it lacks true leaves and relies on its roots for both anchorage and nutrient absorption. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Xylosterculia is considered a conservation concern."
