    "intro": "Xylopia benthamii, commonly known as the African blackwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its density and durability. The plant has compound leaves with opposite arrangement and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a globose, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
