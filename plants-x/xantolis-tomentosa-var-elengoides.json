    "intro": "Xantolis tomentosa var. elengoides, commonly known as the woolly xantolis, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
