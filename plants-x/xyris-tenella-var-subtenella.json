It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its small, delicate flowers are arranged in dense inflorescences, contributing to its ornamental value in wetland gardens. The species is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in association with other wetland plants."
