    "intro": "Xyris ptariana, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of multiple small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by three leaf-like bracts. Xyris ptariana plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
