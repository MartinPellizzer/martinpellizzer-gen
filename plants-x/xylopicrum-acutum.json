    "intro": "Xylopicrum acutum, commonly known as the sharp-leaved xylopicrum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with sharp, pointed tips. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from well-drained soils. Xylopicrum acutum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
