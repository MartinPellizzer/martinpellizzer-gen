    "intro": "Xeranthemum herbaceum, commonly known as the common rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and well-suited for xeriscaping due to its ability to survive with minimal water. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss."
