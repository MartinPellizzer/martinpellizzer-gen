    "intro": "Xiphopterella parva, commonly known as the small fringed fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, intricately lobed fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is typically found in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Xiphopterella parva is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
