It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with wavy margins. The plant produces spiny, spherical fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
