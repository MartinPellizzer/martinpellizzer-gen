    "intro": "Xylosma quichensis var. subalpina, commonly known as the alpine xylosma, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its woody stems are covered in a thick layer of corky bark, which helps it withstand harsh mountain conditions. This variety is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows."
