    "intro": "Xerotes multiflora var. media, commonly known as the narrowleaf false indigo, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright, woody stems with narrow, gray-green leaves that are arranged oppositely along the branches. The plant produces striking, pea-like flowers in shades of blue or purple during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
