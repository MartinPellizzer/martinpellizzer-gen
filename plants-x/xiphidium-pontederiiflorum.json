It features striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has narrow, sword-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous stem, allowing it to spread vegetatively. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it a notable species in wetland ecosystems."
