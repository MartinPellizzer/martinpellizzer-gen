    "intro": "Ximenia spinosa, commonly known as the prickly pear tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, the Americas, and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its rough, spiny bark and clusters of small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, red or orange fruits resembling small apples. Ximenia spinosa is adapted to poor, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry woodlands. It has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a source of food and dye."
