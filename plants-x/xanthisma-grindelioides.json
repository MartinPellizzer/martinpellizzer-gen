    "intro": "Xanthisma grindelioides, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of North America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid, sandy environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Xanthisma grindelioides is well adapted to harsh desert climates and plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes."
