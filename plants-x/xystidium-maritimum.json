    "intro": "Xystidium maritimum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray florets and a central yellow disk, which resemble a holly-like appearance. The plant has silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention and salt tolerance. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Xystidium maritimum is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to stabilize coastal ecosystems."
