    "intro": "Xiphopteris hartii, commonly known as Hart's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a slender, upright rhizome with a dense cluster of lance-shaped, dark green fronds. Its fronds are usually unlobed and have a glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Xiphopteris hartii is valued for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its ability to stabilize soil in moist habitats."
