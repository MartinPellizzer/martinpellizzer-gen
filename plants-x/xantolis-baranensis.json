    "intro": "Xantolis baranensis, commonly known as the Baranensis xantolis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without being exposed to direct sunlight. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom during the spring and early summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Xantolis baranensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
