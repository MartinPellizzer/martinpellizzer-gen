    "intro": "Xenophyllum amblydactylum, commonly known as the broad-leaved fern, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, red berries that contain the seeds. Xenophyllum amblydactylum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests and swampy areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
