    "intro": "Ximenesia foetida, commonly known as the stinkwood tree, is a member of the Olacaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, with thick, flaky bark that exudes a strong, unpleasant odor when broken. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its small, white or yellowish flowers appear in clusters and are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. The plant is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in local ecosystems and traditional medicine."
