    "intro": "Xanthophyllum griffithii var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed goldencup, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and limited distribution. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
