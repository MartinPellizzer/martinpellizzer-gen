    "intro": "Xerophyta suaveolens var. vestita, commonly known as the sweet-scented sandthorn, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, spineless stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has adapted to arid environments through its thick, water-storing stems and reduced leaf surface area. Its aromatic foliage releases a pleasant scent, which attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
