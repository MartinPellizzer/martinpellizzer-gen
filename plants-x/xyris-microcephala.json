    "intro": "Xyris microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf yellow-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in tight, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. It has a compact growth habit with a short, stout rhizome that helps it spread vegetatively. Xyris microcephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wetland environments."
