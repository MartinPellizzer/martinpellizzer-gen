    "intro": "Xyris asperata, commonly known as rough marsh yelloweye, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Xyridaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Xyris asperata typically grows in wet or moist soils, often in marshes, swamps, or along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as habitat for various small organisms."
