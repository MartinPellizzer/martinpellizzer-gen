    "intro": "Xylotheca, commonly known as the \"wood leaf\" or \"wood moss,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Lamiaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic, often hairy leaves and showy, two-lipped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or blue. The plant is native to regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Xylotheca species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and ecological role in its native habitats."
