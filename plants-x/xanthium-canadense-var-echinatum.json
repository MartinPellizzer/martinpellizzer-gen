    "intro": "Xanthium canadense var. echinatum, commonly known as Canadian cocklebur, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It features prickly, spiny leaves and is characterized by its distinctive, spherical fruit with hooked bracts. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, contributing to its role in pollination. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along fence rows. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain ecosystems."
