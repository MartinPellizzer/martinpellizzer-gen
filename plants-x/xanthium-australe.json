    "intro": "Xanthium australe, commonly known as the Australian cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to Australia and parts of Asia. It is an annual herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, characterized by its prickly leaves and spherical, spiky fruits. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its seeds are enclosed in a rough, burs-like structure. Xanthium australe is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, and it has a hairy stem with alternate leaves. It is known for its ability to thrive in dry conditions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
