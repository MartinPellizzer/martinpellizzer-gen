    "intro": "Xeraea affinis, commonly known as the rock fig, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its dense, woody structure. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, edible fruits that are favored by local wildlife. Xeraea affinis is well adapted to dry environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
