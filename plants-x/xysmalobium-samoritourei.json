    "intro": "Xysmalobium samoritourei, commonly known as the Samoritou's larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the stems are usually hairy, adding to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
