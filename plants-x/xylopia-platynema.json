    "intro": "Xylopia platynema, commonly known as the African star anise, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western Africa. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, rough bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, star-shaped fruits. Its fruit is used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though it is not related to the true star anise (Illicium verum). The botanical features of Xylopia platynema make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts."
