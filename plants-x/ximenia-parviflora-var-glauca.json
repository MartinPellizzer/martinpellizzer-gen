It is characterized by its smooth, bluish-gray bark and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are simple, opposite, and elliptic in shape, with a waxy coating that gives them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible but have a sour taste. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
