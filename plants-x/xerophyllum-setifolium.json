    "intro": "Xerophyllum setifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beargrass, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with long, narrow, grass-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flower clusters in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in a panicle shape. It is adapted to arid and rocky environments, showcasing typical xerophytic features such as reduced leaf surface area and deep root systems. Xerophyllum setifolium plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
