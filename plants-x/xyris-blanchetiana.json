    "intro": "Xyris blanchetiana, commonly known as the Blanchet's yellow-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months. Its inflorescence consists of numerous small, tubular flowers that are arranged in a spike-like structure. Xyris blanchetiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
