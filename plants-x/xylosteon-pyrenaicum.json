    "intro": "Xylosteon pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean wood fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Pyrenees region. It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a long, narrow stalk and compound leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
