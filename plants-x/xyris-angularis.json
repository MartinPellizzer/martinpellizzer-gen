    "intro": "Xyris angularis, commonly known as the angular yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters in early to mid-summer. Its flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and the plant is often found in shallow water or saturated ground. Xyris angularis is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in water garden settings."
