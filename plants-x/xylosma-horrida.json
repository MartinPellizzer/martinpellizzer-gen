    "intro": "Xylosma horrida, commonly known as the rough xylosma, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round fruits. Xylosma horrida is well adapted to dry climates and can thrive in poor soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in desert ecosystems."
