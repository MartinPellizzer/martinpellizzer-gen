    "intro": "Xeranthemum squarrosum var. unicolor, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a low-growing, perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, tubular, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and desert landscapes."
