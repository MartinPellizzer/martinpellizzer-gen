    "intro": "Xylocarpus moluccensis var. gangeticus, commonly known as the Indian mangrove or Gangetic mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to the coastal regions of South and Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that thrives in brackish water environments, often found in tidal forests and estuaries. The plant has thick, fibrous roots that help stabilize the soil and prevent erosion in coastal areas. Its bark is rough and dark, while its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape. The fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by water, contributing to its role in coastal ecosystem dynamics."
