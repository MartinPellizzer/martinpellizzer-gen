    "intro": "Xolemia catesbei, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption, as it cannot photosynthesize due to the absence of chlorophyll. Xolemia catesbei thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in swampy areas. Its delicate structure and unique appearance make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern."
