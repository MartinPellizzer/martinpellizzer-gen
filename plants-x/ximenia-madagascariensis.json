    "intro": "Ximenia madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar sour orange, is a small evergreen tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and dense, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange-red, fleshy berries. Its fruit is edible but has a tart, acidic flavor, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Ximenia madagascariensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry, arid conditions."
