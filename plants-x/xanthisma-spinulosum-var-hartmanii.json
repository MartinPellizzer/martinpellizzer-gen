    "intro": "Xanthisma spinulosum var. hartmanii, commonly known as the Hartman's spiny saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands or along streambanks. The plant features slender, succulent stems covered in small, spiny projections, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, clustered flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. This variety is notable for its adaptations to extreme conditions and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic flora."
