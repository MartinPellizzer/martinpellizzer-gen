    "intro": "Xyris caroliniana f. phyllolepis, commonly known as the broadleaf yellow-eyed grass, is a botanical variant of the yellow-eyed grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, grass-like leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. Its foliage is often more robust and wider than the typical form, giving it a distinct appearance. This fern-like plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
