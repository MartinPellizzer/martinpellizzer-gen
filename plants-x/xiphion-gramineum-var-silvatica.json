    "intro": "Xiphion gramineum var. silvatica, commonly known as the forest daffodil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated corona. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant splash of color to the forest floor. The variety silvatica is characterized by its more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Xiphion gramineum."
