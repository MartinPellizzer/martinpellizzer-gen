    "intro": "Xyridopsis newtonii, commonly known as the Newton's xyrid, is a small, perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Xyridaceae, which includes grass-like plants commonly referred to as \"arrowheads.\" The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. Xyridopsis newtonii is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and its aesthetic appeal in wetland landscapes."
