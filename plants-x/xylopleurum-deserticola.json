It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
