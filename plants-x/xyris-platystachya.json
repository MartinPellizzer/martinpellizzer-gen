    "intro": "Xyris platystachya, commonly known as broadstem swamp yellowroot, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. Xyris platystachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity."
