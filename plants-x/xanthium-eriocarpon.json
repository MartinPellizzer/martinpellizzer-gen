    "intro": "Xanthium eriocarpon, commonly known as the rough cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features rough, prickly leaves and spiny bracts that enclose its small yellow flowers. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny husk, which aids in dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Xanthium eriocarpon is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions."
