    "intro": "Xerobotrys cordifolius, commonly known as the heart-leaved xerobotrys, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically thick and waxy, an adaptation to its arid or semi-arid habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the dry season. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained soils with minimal water, making it well-suited to harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
