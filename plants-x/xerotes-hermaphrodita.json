    "intro": "Xerotes hermaphrodita, commonly known as the desert phlox, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in low-water conditions. The plant produces showy clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration. Xerotes hermaphrodita is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
