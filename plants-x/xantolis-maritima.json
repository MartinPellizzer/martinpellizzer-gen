    "intro": "Xantolis maritima, commonly known as the sea dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy, gray-green leaves adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Xantolis maritima thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
