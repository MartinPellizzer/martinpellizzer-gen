    "intro": "Xenismia acanthosperma, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its wiry, spiny stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna. Its seeds are adapted for dispersal by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution across the continent."
