    "intro": "Xantholinum flavum, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a rare flowering plant characterized by its striking yellow-orange petals and intricate floral structure. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features a tall, slender stem with a single, showy bloom that resembles a flame in its vibrant coloration. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Xantholinum flavum is known for its unique pollination mechanism, attracting specific insects with its nectar-rich spur."
