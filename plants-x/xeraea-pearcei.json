    "intro": "Xeraea pearcei, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features dense, spiny foliage with small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to survive in poor soil conditions. Xeraea pearcei is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in dry climates."
