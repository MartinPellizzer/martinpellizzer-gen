    "intro": "Xanthium echinatum, commonly known as the spiny sow-thistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and adaptability. Xanthium echinatum has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
