    "intro": "Xylosma fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered xylosma, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. Xylosma fasciculata is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
