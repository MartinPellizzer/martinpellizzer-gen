    "intro": "Xeroplana zeyheri, commonly known as the Zeyher's cycad, is a unique cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves that give it a prehistoric appearance. The plant is adapted to arid environments, showcasing its drought-resistant traits. It produces cones rather than flowers, and its reproductive structures are typically found on separate male and female plants. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
