    "intro": "Xanthium saccharatum var. silphiifolium, commonly known as the yellow cocklebur, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces rough, spherical fruits that contain seeds with hooked bristles, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
