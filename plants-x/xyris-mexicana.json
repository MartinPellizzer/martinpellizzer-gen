    "intro": "Xyris mexicana, commonly known as Mexican yellowroot, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in shaded woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Xyris mexicana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
