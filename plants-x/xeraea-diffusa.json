    "intro": "Xeraea diffusa, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a woody shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
