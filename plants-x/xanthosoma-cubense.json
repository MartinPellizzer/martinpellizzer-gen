It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Xanthosoma cubense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in warm climates."
