    "intro": "Ximenia horrida, commonly known as the horrid ximenia, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds. Ximenia horrida is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
