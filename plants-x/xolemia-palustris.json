    "intro": "Xolemia palustris, commonly known as the marsh xolemia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in areas with high humidity and limited sunlight. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are pale green to white, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the summer months. Xolemia palustris plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
