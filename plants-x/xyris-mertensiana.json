    "intro": "Xyris mertensiana, commonly known as the swamp yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Xyris mertensiana is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
