    "intro": "Xysmalobium pedunculatum, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in dry conditions, and its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and moths."
