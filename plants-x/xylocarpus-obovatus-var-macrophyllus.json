    "intro": "Xylocarpus obovatus var. macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leaf mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, obovate leaves that are typically larger than those of the standard species. The plant thrives in brackish water environments, often forming dense stands in coastal areas. Its bark is thick and corky, providing structural support and resistance to saltwater. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds, aiding in its propagation in tidal zones."
