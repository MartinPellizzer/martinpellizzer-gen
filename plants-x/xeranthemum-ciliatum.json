    "intro": "Xeranthemum ciliatum, commonly known as the cottonweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are hairy and often have a woolly texture, which helps reduce water loss. Xeranthemum ciliatum produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators."
