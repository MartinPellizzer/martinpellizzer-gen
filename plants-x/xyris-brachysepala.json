    "intro": "Xyris brachysepala, commonly known as the dwarf yellow-eyed grass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Xyridaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and parts of Georgia. The plant is characterized by its compact stature, with grass-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Xyris brachysepala plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
