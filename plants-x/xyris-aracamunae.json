It belongs to the family Xyridaceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
