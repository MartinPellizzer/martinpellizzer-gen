    "intro": "Xanthium chasei, commonly known as the rough cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and rough, prickly leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its spiny bracts and spherical seed heads are notable features that aid in seed dispersal. Xanthium chasei is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
