    "intro": "Xanthium saccharatum, commonly known as sugarleaf or rough hawksbeard, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. Its seeds are encased in a spiny, three-lobed pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. Xanthium saccharatum is often found in disturbed soils and can become a weed in agricultural fields."
