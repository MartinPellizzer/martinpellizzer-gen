    "intro": "Xerandra celosioides, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and inland dunes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or grayish coating, which helps reduce water loss. Xerandra celosioides produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
