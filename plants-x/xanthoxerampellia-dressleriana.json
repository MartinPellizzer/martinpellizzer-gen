    "intro": "Xanthoxerampellia dressleriana, commonly known as the Dressler's xanthoxerampellia, is a rare and striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, yellow-orange bracts that surround its compact inflorescence. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
