    "intro": "Xyris bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahamian yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the Bahamas. It belongs to the Xyridaceae family, which includes grass-like plants often found in wet or moist environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in swampy or marshy habitats. Xyris bahiensis is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in maintaining wetland biodiversity."
