    "intro": "Xerodraba mendocinensis, commonly known as the Mendocino xerodraba, is a rare and endemic plant species native to California. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, reflecting its ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring season. It is typically found in rocky outcrops and dry, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
