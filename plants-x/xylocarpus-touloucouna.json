    "intro": "Xylocarpus touloucouna, commonly known as the African yellow-wood, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its dense, hard, and heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to pests. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Xylocarpus touloucouna is also known for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
