    "intro": "Xerandra, commonly known as the rock fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae. It is native to the island of Madagascar and consists of several species, including Xerandra madagascariensis. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their rough, fissured bark and opposite, simple leaves. Xerandra species produce small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. They are adapted to dry, rocky environments and are often found in coastal and inland regions of Madagascar."
