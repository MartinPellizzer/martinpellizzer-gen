    "intro": "Xylon tunariense, commonly known as the Tunari wood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its sturdy, straight trunk and dense, fibrous bark that provides structural support. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are arranged alternately along the stem. Xylon tunariense produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. This species is valued for its durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
