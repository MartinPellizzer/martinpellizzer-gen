    "intro": "Xylopleurum roseum, commonly known as the pink sandalwood, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and pale pink, often clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
