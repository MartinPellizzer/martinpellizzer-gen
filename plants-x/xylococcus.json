    "intro": "Xylococcus, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Burseraceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The trees are small to medium in size, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with smooth, grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves. Xylococcus species are valued for their fragrant wood, which is used in traditional crafts and perfumery. They also produce small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds."
