    "intro": "Xylonymus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Xylonymus is native to regions of Central and South America and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an invasive species in some areas."
