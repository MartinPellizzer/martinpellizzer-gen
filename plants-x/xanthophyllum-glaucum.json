    "intro": "Xanthophyllum glaucum, commonly known as the blue-green saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, waxy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Xanthophyllum glaucum thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical features make it a hardy and resilient species often found in high-altitude environments."
