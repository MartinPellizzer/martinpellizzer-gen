    "intro": "Xiphopteris punctata, commonly known as the punctate cliff fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It thrives in rocky, coastal habitats where it clings to vertical cliffs and exposed rock faces. The plant has finely divided, linear fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, rusty-brown hairs. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing clusters, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Xiphopteris punctata is considered a sensitive indicator of coastal ecosystem health."
