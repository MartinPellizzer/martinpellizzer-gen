    "intro": "Xanthophyllum reflexum, commonly known as the reflexed yellowleaf, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its yellowish flowers and hairy stems, which are typical of the genus Xanthophyllum. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in shaded understory habitats. The leaves are reflexed, meaning they curl backward at the edges, giving the plant its distinctive appearance."
