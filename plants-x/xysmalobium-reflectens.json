    "intro": "Xysmalobium reflectens, commonly known as the silverleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which reflects light and helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow with a white or pink center, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. Xysmalobium reflectens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
