    "intro": "Xylophacos casei, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in many parts of its native range."
