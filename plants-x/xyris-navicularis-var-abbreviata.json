    "intro": "Xyris navicularis var. abbreviata, commonly known as the narrowleaf yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Xyridaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually less than 10 cm in length, and the yellow flowers appear in early spring. The species is noted for its compact growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance."
