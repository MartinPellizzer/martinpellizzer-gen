    "intro": "Ximenia loranthifolia, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in dry forest and woodland habitats, and its wood is valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. Ximenia loranthifolia also plays a role in supporting local biodiversity, providing food and habitat for various insects and birds."
