    "intro": "Xiphopteris heterophylla, commonly known as the variable spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a distinctive morphology, with fronds that vary in shape depending on their position on the plant. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Xiphopteris heterophylla is often used as an indicator species for acidic, nutrient-poor soils."
