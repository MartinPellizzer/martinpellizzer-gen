    "intro": "Xetola transsylvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense forests of Transylvania. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that shimmer with a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found near ancient, decaying wood. Its unique ability to absorb atmospheric moisture makes it well adapted to its humid, forested habitat. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Xetola transsylvanica remains a subject of fascination and study among botanists."
