    "intro": "Xamilenis acaulis, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with a compact, stemless base. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Xamilenis acaulis is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient and hardy species."
