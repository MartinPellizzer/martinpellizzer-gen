It features grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant is characterized by its swollen, club-shaped rhizomes, which store nutrients and aid in its survival. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and riverine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
