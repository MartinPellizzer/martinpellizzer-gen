    "intro": "Xanthisma texanum var. drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Xanthisma texanum var. drummondii thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sun-exposed areas."
