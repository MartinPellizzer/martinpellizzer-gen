    "intro": "Xanthophyllum pulchrum, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems, forming a bell-like shape that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Xanthophyllum pulchrum thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
