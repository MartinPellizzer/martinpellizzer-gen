    "intro": "Xerotes sororia var. teres, commonly known as the compact stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to arid regions of North America. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in tight rosettes to minimize water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, thriving in environments with minimal water. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
