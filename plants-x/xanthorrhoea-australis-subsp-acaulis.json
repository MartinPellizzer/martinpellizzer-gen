    "intro": "Xanthorrhoea australis subsp. acaulis, commonly known as the grass tree, is a unique plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette around a woody stem. The plant produces a tall, cylindrical flower spike that can reach several meters in height. Xanthorrhoea australis subsp. acaulis is adapted to dry, sandy soils and can survive in harsh, arid environments. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a distinctive and resilient component of the Australian flora."
