    "intro": "Xyris densa, commonly known as yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of small, clustered flowers, which are often mistaken for a single bloom. Xyris densa is a member of the Xyridaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
