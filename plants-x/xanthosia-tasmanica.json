    "intro": "Xanthosia tasmanica, commonly known as the Tasmanian sandbur, is a flowering plant native to Tasmania. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, spindly stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces burrs with hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. Xanthosia tasmanica is adapted to temperate climates and is relatively drought-tolerant."
