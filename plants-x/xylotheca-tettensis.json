    "intro": "Xylotheca tettensis, commonly known as the Tett's wood lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Teloschistaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, crust-like thallus that is typically dark green to brown in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on bark or stone in forested areas. Xylotheca tettensis has a complex structure with a distinct upper and lower cortex, and it reproduces via apothecia that bear ascospores. This lichen is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role in nutrient cycling and its sensitivity to environmental changes."
