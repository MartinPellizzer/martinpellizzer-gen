    "intro": "Xeromphis uliginosa, commonly known as marsh morning glory, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. It plays a role in providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Xeromphis uliginosa is an important species for ecological studies due to its adaptability to waterlogged conditions."
