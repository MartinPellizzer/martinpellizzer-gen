    "intro": "Xylopicrum magnum, commonly known as the giant woodroot, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its thick, woody stem that can grow up to three meters in height, with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by elongated, seed-filled pods. Its roots are highly fibrous and capable of absorbing nutrients from deep within the soil, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, Xylopicrum magnum is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
