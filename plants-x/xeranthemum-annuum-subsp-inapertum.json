    "intro": "Xeranthemum annuum subsp. inapertum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heliotrope, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, yellowish to orange flowers that are typically tubular in shape. The leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
