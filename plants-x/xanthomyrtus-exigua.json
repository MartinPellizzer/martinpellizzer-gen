    "intro": "Xanthomyrtus exigua, commonly known as the dwarf myrtle, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are glossy and have a distinct aromatic scent when crushed, which is a common trait among members of the Myrtaceae family. Xanthomyrtus exigua is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
