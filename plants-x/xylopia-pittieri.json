    "intro": "Xylopia pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's xylopia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Annonaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains several seeds. Xylopia pittieri is characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
