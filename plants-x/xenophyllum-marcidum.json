    "intro": "Xenophyllum marcidum, commonly known as the fragrant ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique, almost ethereal appearance that resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting specific pollinators such as certain species of bees and wasps. Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, Xenophyllum marcidum is considered endangered and is protected in many regions. Its botanical study offers valuable insights into the ecological relationships and conservation challenges of rare orchid species."
