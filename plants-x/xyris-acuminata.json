    "intro": "Xyris acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed goldeneye, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to wet soils. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing soil in wetland environments. Xyris acuminata is also an important nectar source for various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
