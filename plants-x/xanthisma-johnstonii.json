The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Xanthisma johnstonii is adapted to survive in harsh, sandy environments with minimal water availability. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecological dynamics in its native habitat."
