    "intro": "Xyris seubertii var. seubertii, commonly known as the Seubert's yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Xyridaceae, which includes grass-like plants often found in wet or moist habitats. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This variety is adapted to wetlands and shaded areas, making it an important component of riparian and swamp ecosystems."
