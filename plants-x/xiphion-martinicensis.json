    "intro": "Xiphion martinicensis, commonly known as the Martinique lily, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean island of Martinique. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in the summer months, producing clusters of white or pale pink petals that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often forming a rosette at the base of the plant. Xiphion martinicensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its dramatic floral display."
