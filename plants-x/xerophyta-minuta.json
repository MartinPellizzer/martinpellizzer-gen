    "intro": "Xerophyta minuta, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Xerophyta minuta is well adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures."
