    "intro": "Xylosma prunifolia, commonly known as the cherryleaf xylosma, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters, with a dense, spreading crown and smooth, greyish bark. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cherry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
