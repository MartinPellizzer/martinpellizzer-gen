    "intro": "Xerococcus congestus, commonly known as the clustered rockcress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often found on rocky outcrops and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Xerococcus congestus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, low-maintenance conditions."
