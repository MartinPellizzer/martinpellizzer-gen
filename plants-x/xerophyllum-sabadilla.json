    "intro": "Xerophyllum sabadilla, commonly known as the sabadilla lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and tall, slender flowering stalks. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in loose panicles. Xerophyllum sabadilla is adapted to arid environments, exhibiting xerophytic traits such as thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. It is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry garden settings."
