    "intro": "Xerophyta somalensis, commonly known as the Somali cress, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Somalia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its small, white to yellowish flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can tolerate high temperatures and low water availability. Xerophyta somalensis is often found in coastal and inland desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or spreading, allowing it to cover large areas in its native habitat."
