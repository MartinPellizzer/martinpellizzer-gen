    "intro": "Xanthium multifidum, commonly known as common cocklebur, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It is characterized by its prickly, spiny leaves and large, spherical fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous coating. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it relies on wind for pollination. Xanthium multifidum is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
