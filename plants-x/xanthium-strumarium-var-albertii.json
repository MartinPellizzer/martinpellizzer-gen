It is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its prickly, spiny leaves and large, spherical fruit capsules. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Its leaves are palmately lobed with serrated edges, and the stems are hairy and often branched. The fruit, which contains several seeds, is adapted for dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing."
