    "intro": "Xanthium spinosum var. ambrosioides, commonly known as rough cocklebur, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, prickly leaves and spherical, rough-textured fruit capsules. The plant typically grows in disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in heads, and it produces a large number of seeds that are dispersed by wind. The plant is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and persistent seed production."
