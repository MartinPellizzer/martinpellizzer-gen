    "intro": "Xanthoxalis corniculata subsp. purpurea, commonly known as purple sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with a mat-forming habit, featuring hairy stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
