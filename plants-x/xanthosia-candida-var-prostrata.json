    "intro": "Xanthosia candida var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate white everlasting, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
