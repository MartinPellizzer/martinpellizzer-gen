    "intro": "Xanthium humile, commonly known as common cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its prickly, spiny leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces spherical, burr-like fruits that are covered in hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Xanthium humile is considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
