    "intro": "Xaveria, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Xaveria species produce yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by fluffy seed heads similar to those of dandelions. These plants are often found in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas."
