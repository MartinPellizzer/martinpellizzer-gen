    "intro": "Xiphopteris limula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of clubmoss native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a dense, compact form. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper parts of the stems. Xiphopteris limula is a perennial plant that plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
