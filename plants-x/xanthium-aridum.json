    "intro": "Xanthium aridum, commonly known as the desert cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is an annual herb that grows from 30 to 100 centimeters tall, with hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into spiny, spherical fruits containing seeds. Xanthium aridum is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in some areas."
