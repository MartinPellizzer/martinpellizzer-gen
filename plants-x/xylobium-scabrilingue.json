It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its rough, often hairy leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Xylobium scabrilingue is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks."
