It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, blooming in the spring. Xiphosium roseum is often found in rocky or arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is also noted for its ability to store water in its tissues, making it drought-tolerant."
