    "intro": "Xanthium cenchroides, commonly known as common cocklebur, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical fruits that encase the seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces yellow flowers in clusters. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Xanthium cenchroides is considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
