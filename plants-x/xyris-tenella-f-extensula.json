It is a member of the Xyridaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and has slender, grass-like leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of bright yellow blooms, which attract various pollinators. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Xyris tenella."
