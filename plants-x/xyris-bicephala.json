    "intro": "Xyris bicephala, commonly known as the two-headed yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and wetlands. Its botanical name reflects the appearance of its two distinct flower heads, which resemble two separate crowns. Xyris bicephala is often found in wetland habitats and is adapted to periodic flooding."
