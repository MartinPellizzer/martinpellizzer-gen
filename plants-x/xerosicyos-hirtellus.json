    "intro": "Xerosicyos hirtellus, commonly known as the desert caltrop, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing shrub with spiny, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, spiky fruit capsules. Its adaptations include thick, waxy leaves and deep root systems to survive extreme drought conditions. Xerosicyos hirtellus is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its resilience in challenging climates."
