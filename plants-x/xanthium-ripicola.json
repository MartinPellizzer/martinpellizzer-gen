    "intro": "Xanthium ripicola, commonly known as rough cocklebur, is a prickly annual plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and spherical, burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in fields. Its yellow flowers are inconspicuous and are followed by the characteristic burs that contain the seeds. Xanthium ripicola is often considered a weed but has ecological and historical significance."
