    "intro": "Xylomelum occidentale, commonly known as the Western xylomelum, is a shrub native to southern Western Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes."
