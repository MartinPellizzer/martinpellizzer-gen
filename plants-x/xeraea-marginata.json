    "intro": "Xeraea marginata, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found along dunes and rocky outcrops. Xeraea marginata is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
