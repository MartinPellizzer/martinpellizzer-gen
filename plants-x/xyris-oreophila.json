    "intro": "Xyris oreophila, commonly known as the mountain xyris, is a species of flowering plant in the family Xyridaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly found in wetlands and swampy areas. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet and features grass-like leaves with yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Xyris oreophila is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
