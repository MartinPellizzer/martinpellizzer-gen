    "intro": "Xyris trachyphylla f. itacolumitica, commonly known as the Itacolumi marsh yelloweye, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the wetlands of Florida. It is a member of the Xyridaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow, acidic wetlands and requires consistent moisture for survival. Its small, clustered inflorescences produce numerous yellow blooms, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
