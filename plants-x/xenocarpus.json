    "intro": "Xenocarpus, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers, and their distinctive, spiky seed structures. Xenocarpus species are typically found in temperate regions and are often associated with disturbed soils due to their adaptability. The leaves are usually alternate, lance-shaped, and have a rough or hairy texture. They produce wind-dispersed seeds that are encased in a pappus, aiding in their spread."
