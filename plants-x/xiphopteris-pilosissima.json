    "intro": "Xiphopteris pilosissima, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the forest floor. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
