    "intro": "Ximenia coriacea, commonly known as the African whitewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, leathery leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, orange-red berries. Ximenia coriacea is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
