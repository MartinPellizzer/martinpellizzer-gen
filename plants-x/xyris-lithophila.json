    "intro": "Xyris lithophila, commonly known as the rock yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows on rocky slopes and in open woodlands, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of clustered, spike-like racemes that are attractive to pollinators. Xyris lithophila is adapted to full sun and is often found in limestone or sandy soils."
