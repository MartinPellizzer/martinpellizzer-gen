    "intro": "Xeranthemum erectum, commonly known as the upright thyme-leafed erica, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with gray-green, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Xeranthemum erectum is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its foliage and flowers are often used in traditional herbal remedies and as a decorative plant."
