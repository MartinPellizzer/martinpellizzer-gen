    "intro": "Xerobius, commonly known as the desert bean, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Xerobius is adapted to survive in low-water environments through deep root systems and thick, waxy leaves. Its botanical features make it a resilient species in harsh, desert climates."
