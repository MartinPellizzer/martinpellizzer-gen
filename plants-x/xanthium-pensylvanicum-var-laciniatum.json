    "intro": "Xanthium pensylvanicum var. laciniatum, commonly known as the cut-leaved cocklebur, is a biennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a fern-like appearance. The plant produces spiny, spherical fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, burr-like structure. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along fence rows. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
