    "intro": "Xantholinum capitatum, commonly known as the goldenhead daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Xantholinum capitatum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to xeriscaped gardens. Its nectar-rich flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
