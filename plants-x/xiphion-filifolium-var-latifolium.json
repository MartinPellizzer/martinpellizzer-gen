    "intro": "Xiphion filifolium var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are broader than the typical variety, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
