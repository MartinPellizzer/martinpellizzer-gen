    "intro": "Xeraea prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate xeraea, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and landscape design in arid climates."
