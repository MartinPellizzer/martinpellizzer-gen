    "intro": "Xanthorrhoea brunonis subsp. brunonis, commonly known as the Brunner's grass tree, is a unique and ancient plant native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, narrow trunk and a dense crown of grass-like leaves that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in spikes, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Xanthorrhoea brunonis subsp. brunonis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It is also known for its ability to store water in its stem, making it resilient to drought."
