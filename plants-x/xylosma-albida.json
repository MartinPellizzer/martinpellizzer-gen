It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Xylosma albida is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in semi-arid environments. It has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
