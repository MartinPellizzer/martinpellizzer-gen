    "intro": "Xiphopteris heteromorpha var. dependens, commonly known as the hanging water fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that hang from the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures are small and clustered, typical of the fern family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
