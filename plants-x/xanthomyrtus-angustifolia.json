It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight pubescent texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it is often found in coastal or sandy soils. Xanthomyrtus angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
