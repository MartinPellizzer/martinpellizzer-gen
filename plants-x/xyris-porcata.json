    "intro": "Xyris porcata, commonly known as the hogweed or porcine yellowroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and wetlands. The plant features a short, stout rhizome and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a reddish or purple hue at the base. Xyris porcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wetland environments."
