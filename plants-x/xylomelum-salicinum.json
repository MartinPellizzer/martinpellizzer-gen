    "intro": "Xylomelum salicinum, commonly known as the silky gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive silvery-white underside, contributing to its ornamental value. Xylomelum salicinum is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
