    "intro": "Xerospermum topengii, commonly known as the Tibetan tansy, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically grayish-green with a rough texture. Xerospermum topengii is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found growing in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its region."
