    "intro": "Xylosma boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian xylosma, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often leathery in texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. Xylosma boliviana is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Its wood is sometimes used locally for construction or fuel, though it is not widely commercially exploited."
