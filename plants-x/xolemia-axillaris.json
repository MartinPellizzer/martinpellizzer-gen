    "intro": "Xolemia axillaris, commonly known as the axillary xolemia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique growth habit involves producing flowers and leaves from the axillary buds, which are the points where leaves meet the stem. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Xolemia axillaris is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
