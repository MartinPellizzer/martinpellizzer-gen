    "intro": "Xylosma, commonly known as the \"false holly\" or \"xylosma,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It consists of about 150 species, predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, Africa, and Asia. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with simple, opposite leaves that are often leathery in texture. Xylosma species are characterized by their small, inconspicuous flowers and the production of hard, woody fruits. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
