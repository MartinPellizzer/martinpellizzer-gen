    "intro": "Xerotes montana, commonly known as the mountain xerophyte, is a hardy shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to access moisture from lower soil layers, enhancing its drought tolerance. Xerotes montana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
