    "intro": "Xanthopappus subacaulis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters in height, with a basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white to pale yellow pappus structures that aid in seed dispersal. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. Xanthopappus subacaulis is often found in sandy soils and is considered a characteristic species of desert scrub habitats."
