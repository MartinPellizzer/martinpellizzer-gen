It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are often fragrant, attracting various pollinators. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in local medicine for their purported healing properties. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
