    "intro": "Xerobotrys venulosus, commonly known as the hairy sterculia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub characterized by its rough, often hairy bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Xerobotrys venulosus is adapted to dry or semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought resistance through its thick cuticle and deep root system. It is occasionally cultivated for its ornamental value or used in traditional medicine."
