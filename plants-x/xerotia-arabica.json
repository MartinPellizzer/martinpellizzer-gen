It is a small evergreen shrub with dark green, leathery leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces berries that contain the seeds used to make coffee. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates with well-drained soil. Due to its limited natural range and vulnerability to environmental stress, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
