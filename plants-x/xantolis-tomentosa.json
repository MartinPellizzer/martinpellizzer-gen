    "intro": "Xantolis tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly xantolis, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which provides insulation and protection against harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in high-altitude regions with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
