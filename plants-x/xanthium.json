    "intro": "Xanthium, commonly known as cocklebur, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spiny, prickly fruits that encase the seeds, which are often dispersed by animals or through wind. The plants typically have rough, hairy leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. Xanthium species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in disturbed soils. They are considered invasive in some areas due to their rapid growth and ability to thrive in various environments."
