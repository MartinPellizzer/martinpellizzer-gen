    "intro": "Xanthium nigri, commonly known as black cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and distinctive yellow flowers. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are covered in hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Xanthium nigri is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields. It has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, though it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
