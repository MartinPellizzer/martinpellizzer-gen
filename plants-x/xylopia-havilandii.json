It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, rough-textured bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature. Xylopia havilandii is often found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical forests, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various insects and birds."
