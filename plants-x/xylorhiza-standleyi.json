    "intro": "Xylorhiza standleyi, commonly known as the Standley's wood vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its bark is thick and fibrous, which provides structural support as it climbs trees and shrubs. Xylorhiza standleyi is often found in moist, shaded habitats within rainforests."
