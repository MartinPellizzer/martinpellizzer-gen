    "intro": "Xiphidium caeruleum, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, bright blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swampy areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and it produces clusters of tiny, showy flowers in early spring. Xiphidium caeruleum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
