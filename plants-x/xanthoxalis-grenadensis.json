    "intro": "Xanthoxalis grenadensis, commonly known as the Grenada goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it a striking appearance. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Xanthoxalis grenadensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing coastal soils."
