    "intro": "Xyris asperula, commonly known as stiff marsh yelloweye, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Xyridaceae family and typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. Xyris asperula is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
