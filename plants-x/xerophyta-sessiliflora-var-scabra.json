    "intro": "Xerophyta sessiliflora var. scabra, commonly known as the rough-stemmed ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems and leaves. Its hairy, scaly stems help reduce water loss through transpiration. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
