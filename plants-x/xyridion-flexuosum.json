It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands that help stabilize shoreline areas. Its flowering spikes are usually short and clustered, producing small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Xyridion flexuosum plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
