    "intro": "Xanthium strumarium, commonly known as cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its prickly, spiny fruit capsules that contain seeds with a distinctive crown-like structure. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, and it is often considered a weed. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant produces yellow flowers in the summer. Xanthium strumarium has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
