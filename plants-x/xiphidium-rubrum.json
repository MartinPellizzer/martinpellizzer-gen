It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that bloom in dense, rounded clusters, attracting a variety of pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 meters, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. Its floral structure consists of five petals that are fused at the base, forming a tube-like shape that opens to reveal stamens and a central pistil. Xiphidium rubrum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils."
