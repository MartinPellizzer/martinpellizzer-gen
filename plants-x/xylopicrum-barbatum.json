    "intro": "Xylopicrum barbatum, commonly known as the hairy woodroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its fibrous root system and slender, branching stems. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, clustered in umbels, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Xylopicrum barbatum is often found in woodland edges and meadows, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small insects."
