    "intro": "Xyris intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and wetlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flower clusters in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are composed of three sepals and three petals, typical of the Xyris genus. Xyris intermedia is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
