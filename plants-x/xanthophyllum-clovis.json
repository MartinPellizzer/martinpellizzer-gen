    "intro": "Xanthophyllum clovis, commonly known as the golden flame fern, is a rare and striking plant native to the humid tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its bright yellow fronds that resemble flames, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in dense rainforest canopies. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its humid environment. Xanthophyllum clovis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its potential ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
