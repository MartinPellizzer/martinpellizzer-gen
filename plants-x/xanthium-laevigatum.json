    "intro": "Xanthium laevigatum, commonly known as smooth cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its rough, spiny leaves and distinctive spherical fruit, which contains numerous seeds. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Xanthium laevigatum is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
