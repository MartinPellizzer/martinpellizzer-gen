    "intro": "Xylosma buxifolia var. rotundata, commonly known as the rounded boxwood, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with thick, leathery leaves that are typically oval to rounded in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red or orange berries, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. Due to its compact growth habit and foliage density, it is often used as a topiary or hedge plant."
