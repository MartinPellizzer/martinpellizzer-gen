    "intro": "Xanthophyllum ellipticum var. subcoriaceum, commonly known as the smooth-leafed goldenleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features lanceolate leaves that are typically smooth and waxy, with a yellowish-green hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in umbels, often surrounded by a dense ring of bracts. Its stems are upright and slightly hairy, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The varietal form subcoriaceum is distinguished by its slightly thicker, more leathery leaf texture compared to the typical variety."
