    "intro": "Xanthium inflexum, commonly known as cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its prickly, spiny leaves and spherical, burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in fields. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Xanthium inflexum is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
