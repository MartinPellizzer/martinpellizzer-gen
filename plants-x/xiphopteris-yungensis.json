    "intro": "Xiphopteris yungensis, commonly known as Yung's sword fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Yungui Plateau in China. It belongs to the family Huperjiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Xiphopteris yungensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
