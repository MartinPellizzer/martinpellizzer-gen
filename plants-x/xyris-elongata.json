    "intro": "Xyris elongata, commonly known as the tall swamp yellowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Xyris elongata is a member of the Xyridaceae family, which includes several species of flowering plants adapted to wet environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to the ecological structure of its habitat."
