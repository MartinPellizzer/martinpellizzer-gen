    "intro": "Xyris atriceps subsp. atriceps, commonly known as the blackleaf yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers with three sepals and three petals. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other wetland flora. The subspecies is characterized by its dark green foliage and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability to moist environments."
