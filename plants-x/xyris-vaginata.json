    "intro": "Xyris vaginata, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Xyridaceae and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to saturated soil conditions. Its flowers bloom in early summer and are composed of three sepals and three petals, which are often mistaken for true leaves. Xyris vaginata plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
