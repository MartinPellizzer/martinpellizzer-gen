    "intro": "Xolisma longelaminata, commonly known as the long-leaf xolisma, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescence. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Xolisma longelaminata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
