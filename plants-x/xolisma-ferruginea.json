    "intro": "Xolisma ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty xolisma, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its leaves are finely divided and have a slightly hairy texture, while its fruit is a small, dry schizocarp that splits into two parts when mature. Xolisma ferruginea is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
