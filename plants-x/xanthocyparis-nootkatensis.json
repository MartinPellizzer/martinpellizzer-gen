    "intro": "Xanthocyparis nootkatensis, commonly known as the Alaska cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are flattened and dark green. The tree produces small, round cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. Its bark is thin, scaly, and reddish in color, and it is often used in traditional Native American crafts. Xanthocyparis nootkatensis is adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray and strong winds."
