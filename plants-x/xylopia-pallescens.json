    "intro": "Xylopia pallescens, commonly known as the pale xylopia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Annonaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Xylopia pallescens is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
