    "intro": "Xerothamnus ecklonianus, commonly known as the desert sagebrush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its gray-green, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Xerothamnus ecklonianus is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife in its native range."
