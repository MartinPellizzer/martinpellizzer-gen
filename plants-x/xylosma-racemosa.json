    "intro": "Xylosma racemosa, commonly known as the clustered xylosma, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, often thorny growth habit and small, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, woody fruits. Xylosma racemosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry landscapes. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
