    "intro": "Xanthium commune var. wootonii, commonly known as rough cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, spherical fruit that contains toxic seeds. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it relies on wind pollination. The species is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and persistent seed production."
