    "intro": "Xylophacos utahensis, commonly known as the Utah xylophacos, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the arid regions of Utah. It is a small, perennial shrub characterized by its dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and succulent-like leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range."
