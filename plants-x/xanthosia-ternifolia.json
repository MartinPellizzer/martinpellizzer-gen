    "intro": "Xanthosia ternifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a shrub native to the south-western regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, dark green leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits. Xanthosia ternifolia is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. It is also valued for its hard, durable wood and is used in traditional Aboriginal crafts."
