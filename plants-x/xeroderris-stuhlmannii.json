    "intro": "Xeroderris stuhlmannii, commonly known as the silky ash, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats. Xeroderris stuhlmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes planted in gardens for its attractive foliage and resilience to coastal conditions."
