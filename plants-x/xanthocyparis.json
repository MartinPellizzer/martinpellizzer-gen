It is characterized by its distinctive yellow-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are scale-like and densely packed, forming a compact, conical shape. Xanthocyparis species typically grow in coastal areas and are adapted to moist, temperate climates. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in specific environmental conditions."
