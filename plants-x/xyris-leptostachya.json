    "intro": "Xyris leptostachya, commonly known as slender-stamen yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Xyris leptostachya plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and wildlife."
