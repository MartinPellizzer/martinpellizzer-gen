    "intro": "Xylosteon ledebourii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Xylosteon ledebourii is often found in coastal and inland desert areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
