    "intro": "Xeranthemum regale, commonly known as the royal xeranthemum, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Xeranthemum regale is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant flowers and drought tolerance."
