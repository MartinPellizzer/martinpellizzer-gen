    "intro": "Xylobium corrugatum var. wageneri, commonly known as the wrinkled wood lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, irregularly wrinkled thallus. It typically grows on bark or wood surfaces in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest regions. The thallus is usually pale to dark green, with a leathery texture and a distinct, wrinkled appearance. It lacks true leaves but has a complex structure of fungal hyphae and algal cells that work together for photosynthesis. This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
