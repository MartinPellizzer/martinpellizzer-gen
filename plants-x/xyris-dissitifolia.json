    "intro": "Xyris dissitifolia, commonly known as the scattered hair grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, giving it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Xyris dissitifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for native gardens."
