    "intro": "Xylosma litoralis, commonly known as sea xylosma, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are covered in a thick, corky layer that provides protection against salt spray and erosion. Xylosma litoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
