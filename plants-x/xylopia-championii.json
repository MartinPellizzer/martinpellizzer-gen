    "intro": "Xylopia championii, commonly known as the African star anise, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to West Africa. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by distinctive, star-shaped fruits. Its fruit is often used in traditional medicine and as a spice due to its strong, licorice-like aroma. Xylopia championii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
