    "intro": "Xiquexique tuberculatus, commonly known as the peacock orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the highlands of Colombia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble the plumage of a peacock, with intricate patterns of purple and white. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in montane forests. Its flowers bloom in the spring and are pollinated by specific species of bees and wasps. Due to habitat loss, Xiquexique tuberculatus is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
