It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or herb, with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its yellow flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss."
