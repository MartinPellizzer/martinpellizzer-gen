    "intro": "Xyris contracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has grass-like leaves that are narrow and linear, with a bright yellow flower spike that emerges in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a striking yellow color that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Xyris contracta plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
