It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
