    "intro": "Xeniatrum umbellulatum, commonly known as the starflower of the highlands, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white and yellow. The plant has a compact growth habit and thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of silvery hair, which helps to reduce water loss. Xeniatrum umbellulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
