    "intro": "Xylopia blancoi, commonly known as the Cuban xylopia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Annonaceae. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba, and is characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and broad, simple leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by round, fleshy berries. Xylopia blancoi is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its botanical features make it an important component of the region's biodiversity and ecological systems."
