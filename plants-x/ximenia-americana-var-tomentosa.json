    "intro": "Ximenia americana var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly ximenia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its rough, hairy bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves and fruits are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
