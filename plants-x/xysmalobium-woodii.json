    "intro": "Xysmalobium woodii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It has small, fleshy leaves and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction, making it highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Xysmalobium woodii is one of the most threatened orchids in the world."
