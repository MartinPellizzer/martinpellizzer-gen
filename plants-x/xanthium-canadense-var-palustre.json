    "intro": "Xanthium canadense var. palustre, commonly known as swamp cocklebur, is a perennial herb native to wetland areas of North America. It features a hairy, branched stem that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, often found in marshes and along stream banks. The plant produces spiny, spherical fruits that contain seeds covered in hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and a rough texture. It is often considered a weed in agricultural fields but plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
