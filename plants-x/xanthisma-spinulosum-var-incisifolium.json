    "intro": "Xanthisma spinulosum var. incisifolium, commonly known as the serrated sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and has hairy, often lobed leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. This variant is distinguished by its finely serrated leaf margins, which set it apart from other varieties of Xanthisma."
