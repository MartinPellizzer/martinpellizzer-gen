    "intro": "Ximenia americana var. oblonga, commonly known as the oblong leaf ximenia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. The bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and astringent properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
