    "intro": "Xylocarpus moluccensis var. ellipticus, commonly known as the elliptic mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody, stilt-rooted structure that allows it to thrive in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has elongated, elliptical leaves that are typically alternate and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) in texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces woody, spherical fruits that contain a single seed. This variant plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
