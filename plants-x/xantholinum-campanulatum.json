It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, hairy texture, aiding in water retention in arid environments. Xantholinum campanulatum prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
