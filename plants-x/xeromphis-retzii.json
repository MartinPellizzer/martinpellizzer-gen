    "intro": "Xeromphis retzii, commonly known as the narrowleaf evening primrose, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Xeromphis retzii is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in semi-arid climates."
