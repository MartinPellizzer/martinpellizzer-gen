    "intro": "Xanthium chinense, commonly known as Chinese cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its rough, spiny leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces spherical, prickly fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Xanthium chinense is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
