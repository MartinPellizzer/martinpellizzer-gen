    "intro": "Xanthostemon petiolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ghostgum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, urn-shaped seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Xanthostemon petiolatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native landscapes."
