    "intro": "Dissochaeta annulata, commonly known as the ringed hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet with a single floret, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Dissochaeta annulata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
