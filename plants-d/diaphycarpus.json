    "intro": "Diaphycarpus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed hakea, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae. It is native to Australia, where it grows in a variety of habitats, including heathlands and dry forests. The plants are characterized by their narrow, needle-like leaves and showy, often pink or red, floral displays. Diaphycarpus species typically have woody stems and produce small, clustered flowers that attract nectar-feeding insects. These plants are well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments."
