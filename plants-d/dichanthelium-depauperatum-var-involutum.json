It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils, such as those found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are often rolled or curled, giving it its common name. This variant is part of the Poaceae family and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation."
