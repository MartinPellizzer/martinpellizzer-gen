    "intro": "Diplectria barbata, commonly known as the hairy tamarind, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and distinctive, hairy foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. The fruit is a small, globose drupe that turns red when mature, containing a single seed."
