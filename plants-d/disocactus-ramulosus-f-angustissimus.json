    "intro": "Disocactus ramulosus f. angustissimus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed disocactus, is a hybrid cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and narrow, ribbed leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
