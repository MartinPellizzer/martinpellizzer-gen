    "intro": "Diospyros suberifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, orange to red berries. Its bark is thick and cork-like, which contributes to its resilience in dry conditions. Diospyros suberifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit in tropical and subtropical regions."
