    "intro": "Dryopteris doodioides, commonly known as the Doodie's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest understories."
