    "intro": "Deyeuxia ovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf bulrush, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in marshy or aquatic environments, often forming dense stands that help stabilize soil. Deyeuxia ovata is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its potential use in phytoremediation."
