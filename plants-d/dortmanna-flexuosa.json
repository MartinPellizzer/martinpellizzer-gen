    "intro": "Dortmanna flexuosa, commonly known as the creeping dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and damp woodlands. The plant has a creeping rhizome system, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a waxy coating, while its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in umbels. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
