    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata subsp. pendula, commonly known as the weeping grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive pendulous inflorescences, which give it a drooping, weeping appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and meadows, and it thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spikelet-like flowers. This subspecies is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique visual appeal."
