    "intro": "Diplomorpha trichotoma var. ohsumiensis, commonly known as the Ohsumi's featherleaf, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
