    "intro": "Dianella serrulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flax lily, is a perennial evergreen plant native to New Zealand. It features strap-like, dark green leaves with a distinctive serrated edge, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, followed by blue-black berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Dianella serrulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as part of native plant landscapes."
