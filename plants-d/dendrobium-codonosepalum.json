    "intro": "Dendrobium codonosepalum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender stems and produces clusters of white or pale green flowers with a distinctive, ghost-like appearance. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid environment. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after in the horticultural trade."
