    "intro": "Deparia forsythii-majoris, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a rhizomatous growth habit. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
