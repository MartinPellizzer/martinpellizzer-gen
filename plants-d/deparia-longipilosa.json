    "intro": "Deparia longipilosa, commonly known as the long-hair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in fine, long hairs, giving it its common name. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
