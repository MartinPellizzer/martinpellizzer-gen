    "intro": "Dendropanax heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable-leaf arrowhead, is a climbing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, often heart-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its rapid growth habit and ability to climb make it an effective ground cover in shaded environments. The botanical features of Dendropanax heterophyllus make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural applications."
