    "intro": "Dalbergia mexicana, commonly known as Mexican rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and acoustic properties. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its rarity and demand, it is considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
