    "intro": "Dicranopygium izabalense, commonly known as the Izabal fern, is a tropical plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is often covered in a dense layer of fine roots, which helps in absorbing moisture from the soil. Dicranopygium izabalense plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
