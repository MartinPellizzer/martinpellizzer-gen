    "intro": "Dipteris crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant has a complex rhizome system that helps anchor it in aquatic environments. Its leaves are typically divided into small, finger-like segments called pinnae. Dipteris crassifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
