    "intro": "Delphinium rangtangense, commonly known as the Rangtang larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typical of the Delphinium genus, which are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and are often covered with a fine layer of down. Delphinium rangtangense thrives in cool, moist environments and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat."
