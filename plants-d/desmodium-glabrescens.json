    "intro": "Desmodium glabrescens, commonly known as hairy ticktrefoil, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Desmodium glabrescens plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria."
