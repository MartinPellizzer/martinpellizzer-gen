    "intro": "Daemonorops microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a crown of pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are either male or female, and it relies on specific insect pollinators for reproduction. It is a slow-growing plant that can live for many decades, making it a long-lived component of its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered vulnerable in some regions."
