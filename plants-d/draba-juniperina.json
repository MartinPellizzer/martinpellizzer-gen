It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically has basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate, with a bluish-gray appearance due to dense pubescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates.
