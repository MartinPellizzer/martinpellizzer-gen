    "intro": "Dryopteris nigrovenia, commonly known as the black-veined wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The distinctive black veins in its leaves give it its common name and contribute to its ornamental value in horticulture."
