    "intro": "Deschampsia anadyrensis, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that reflects its adaptation to high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its resilience and ecological significance, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting alpine biodiversity."
