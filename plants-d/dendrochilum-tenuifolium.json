    "intro": "Dendrochilum tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tree orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some horticultural collections, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
