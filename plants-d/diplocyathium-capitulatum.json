    "intro": "Diplocyathium capitulatum, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a compact, globular stem with a distinctive crown of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant's leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are tubular and often attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The species is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry, well-drained soils."
