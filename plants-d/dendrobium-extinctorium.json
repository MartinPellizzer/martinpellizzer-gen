    "intro": "Dendrobium extinctorium, commonly known as the firefly orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that resemble fireflies, hence its common name. The plant typically blooms during the dry season, producing delicate yellow-green flowers with a subtle bioluminescent glow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
