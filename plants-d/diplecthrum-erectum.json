    "intro": "Diplecthrum erectum, commonly known as the tall rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often with a fibrous, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and strap-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Diplecthrum erectum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
