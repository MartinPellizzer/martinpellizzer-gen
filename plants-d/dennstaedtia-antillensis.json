    "intro": "Dennstaedtia antillensis, commonly known as the Antillean water fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean region. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are often submerged in water, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The fronds are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters."
