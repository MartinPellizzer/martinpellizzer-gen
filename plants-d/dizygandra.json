    "intro": "Dizygandra, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of a single species, Dizygandra parviflora, which is native to the southeastern United States. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It produces berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. Dizygandra is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is adapted to thrive in acidic soils."
