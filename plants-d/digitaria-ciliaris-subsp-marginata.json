    "intro": "Digitaria ciliaris subsp. marginata, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with hairy margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
