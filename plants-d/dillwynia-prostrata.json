    "intro": "Dillwynia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate dillwynia, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to southeastern Australia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color, appearing in spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Dillwynia prostrata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
