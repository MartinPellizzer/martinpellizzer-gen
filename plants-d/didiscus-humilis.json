    "intro": "Didiscus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf didiscus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
