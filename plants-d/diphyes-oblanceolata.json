    "intro": "Diphyes oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and often have a waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. Diphyes oblanceolata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
