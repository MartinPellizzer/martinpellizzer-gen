It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is characterized by its distinctive, large, compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a unique growth habit, often forming a tree-like structure with a trunk and spreading branches. Its fronds are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, which helps it thrive in the humid tropical climate.
