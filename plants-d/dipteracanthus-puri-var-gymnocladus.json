    "intro": "Dipteracanthus puri var. gymnocladus, commonly known as the naked-stemmed dipteracanthus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant prefers shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories, where it can thrive in the dappled light. Its leaves are usually elongated and have a smooth surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
