    "intro": "Dimanisa oblongata, commonly known as the elongated dimanisa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pale pink to white, which bloom during the late spring and early summer. Dimanisa oblongata thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a humid, cool climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
