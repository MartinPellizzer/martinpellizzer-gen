    "intro": "Dryopteris uniauriculata, commonly known as the single-ear fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, asymmetrical shape. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing year-round interest in the garden."
