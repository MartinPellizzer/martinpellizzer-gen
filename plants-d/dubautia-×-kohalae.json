    "intro": "Dubautia \u00d7 kohalae, commonly known as the Kohala false dandelion, is a hybrid shrub native to the Hawaiian island of Kohala. It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in coastal and mesic habitats, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of Hawaii, with some tolerance to drought. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
