    "intro": "Dryopteris latiuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf male fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its fertile fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and unique foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
