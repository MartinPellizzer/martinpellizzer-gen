    "intro": "Dimeria scrobiculata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a hairy stem and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Dimeria scrobiculata is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
