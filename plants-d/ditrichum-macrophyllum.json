    "intro": "Ditrichum macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and possesses elongated, slender leaves that are often curved. The plant produces spore capsules that are typically borne on short, erect stalks, which are often covered in a protective sheath. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it forms dense mats. This moss is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
