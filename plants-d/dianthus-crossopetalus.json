    "intro": "Dianthus crossopetalus, commonly known as the Sierra dianthus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, showy blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
