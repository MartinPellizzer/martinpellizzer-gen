    "intro": "Draba confusa, commonly known as the confused whitlow, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its low-growing habit and compact rosette of basal leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Draba confusa is adapted to rocky and arid environments, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its morphology and growth patterns reflect its resilience to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
