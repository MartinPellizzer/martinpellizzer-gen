It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It has hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and morphological traits adapted to its high-altitude environment."
