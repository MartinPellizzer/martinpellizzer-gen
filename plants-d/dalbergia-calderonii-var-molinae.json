It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its acoustic properties. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, featuring compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry to moist forests. Due to its ornamental and timber value, it is also subject to conservation concerns."
