It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and stream banks, thriving in temperate climates. It is well adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. Its ecological significance includes providing habitat and forage for local wildlife."
