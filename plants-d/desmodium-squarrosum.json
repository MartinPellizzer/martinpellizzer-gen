    "intro": "Desmodium squarrosum, commonly known as the hairy burr legume, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant has trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, and its small, yellow flowers are clustered in racemes. Desmodium squarrosum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its seeds are enclosed in inflated, spiny pods that aid in seed dispersal."
