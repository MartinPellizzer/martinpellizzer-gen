    "intro": "Dryopteris davenportii, commonly known as Davenport's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive pattern of pinnae that are often curved and spaced apart. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
