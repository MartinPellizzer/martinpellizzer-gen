    "intro": "Dryopteris melanochlamys, commonly known as the black-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds with prominent black veins, giving it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
