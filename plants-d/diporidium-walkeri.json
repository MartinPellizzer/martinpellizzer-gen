    "intro": "Diporidium walkeri, commonly known as the African violets, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces two types of flowers: one for pollination and another for seed production, a trait reflected in its scientific name. It thrives in humid, well-drained soil and prefers indirect sunlight. Diporidium walkeri is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
