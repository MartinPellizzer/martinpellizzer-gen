    "intro": "Disperma eremophilum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly foliage and clusters of small, pale yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Disperma eremophilum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky soils and sandy plains."
