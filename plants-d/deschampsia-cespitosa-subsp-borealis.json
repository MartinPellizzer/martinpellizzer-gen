    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa subsp. borealis, commonly known as Arctic feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cold, arctic or alpine environments, often growing in well-drained soils. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species in its native range."
