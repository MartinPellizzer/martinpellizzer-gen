    "intro": "Deprea pomacochaensis, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Deprea pomacochaensis is often found in open alpine meadows and is adapted to the extreme climatic conditions of its habitat."
