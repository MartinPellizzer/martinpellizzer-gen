    "intro": "Derris uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp derris, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its most notable feature is the presence of alkaloids, particularly rotenone, which makes it toxic to mammals. Due to its toxic properties, it is often used in traditional pest control methods rather than as a food or medicinal plant."
