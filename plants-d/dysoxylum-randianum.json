It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for construction and furniture-making. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. The tree is often found in dry forest and woodland habitats, and it plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems."
