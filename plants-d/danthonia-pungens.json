    "intro": "Danthonia pungens, commonly known as the spiky grass or needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, sharp, needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Danthonia pungens is well adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in stabilizing soil in arid regions."
