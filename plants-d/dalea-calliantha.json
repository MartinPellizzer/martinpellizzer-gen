    "intro": "Dalea calliantha, commonly known as the showy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. Its compound leaves are pinnately arranged, and it produces small, elliptical seed pods that mature in the fall. Dalea calliantha is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in supporting local pollinators."
