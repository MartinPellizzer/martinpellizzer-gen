    "intro": "Dendrophthoe suborbicularis, commonly known as the suborbicular mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Malaysia. The plant has a fleshy, leafy stem that produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant stress on its host trees if left unchecked."
