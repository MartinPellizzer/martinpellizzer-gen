    "intro": "Dupatya vaginata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsules containing numerous seeds. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an aggressive weed in agricultural settings. Botanically, it belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes other plants such as cotton and hibiscus."
