    "intro": "Dictyodroma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with small, pale green leaves and a single, showy white or pale pink flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological rarity and its role as an indicator of healthy, undisturbed ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Dictyodroma is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
