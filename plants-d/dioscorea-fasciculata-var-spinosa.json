It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by tuberous roots that are often used in traditional medicine. Its spiny stems and leaves serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The tubers are sometimes cultivated for their nutritional value and medicinal properties."
