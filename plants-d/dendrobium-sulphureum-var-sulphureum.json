    "intro": "Dendrobium sulphureum var. sulphureum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive red or purple lip, often blooming in clusters. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in low-light conditions. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is popular in horticulture for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
