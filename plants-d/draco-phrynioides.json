    "intro": "Draco phrynioides, commonly known as the dragon's blood tree, is a unique species native to the island of Socotra. It belongs to the family Dracophytiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown and thick, waxy leaves. The tree produces a red, resinous sap that has been historically used for medicinal and dye purposes. Its botanical features include a thick trunk with flaky bark and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment."
