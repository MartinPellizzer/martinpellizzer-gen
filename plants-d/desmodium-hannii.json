    "intro": "Desmodium hannii, commonly known as the smallleaf desmodium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and forage. Desmodium hannii is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
