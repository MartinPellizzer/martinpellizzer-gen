    "intro": "Dendrobium rhodobotrys, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hair. Its most distinctive characteristic is its showy, red or orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters. Dendrobium rhodobotrys is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant floral display."
