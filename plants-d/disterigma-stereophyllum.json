    "intro": "Disterigma stereophyllum, commonly known as the mountain puya, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous white to pale blue flowers. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Disterigma stereophyllum is adapted to harsh environmental conditions and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native ecosystems."
