    "intro": "Dennstaedtia paraphysata, commonly known as the long-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green and slightly curled when young. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many ferns. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet habitats."
