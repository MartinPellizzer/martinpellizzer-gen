    "intro": "Dryopteris xiphioides, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in challenging terrain. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, narrow shape that gives it a graceful appearance."
