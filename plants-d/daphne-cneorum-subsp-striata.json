    "intro": "Daphne cneorum subsp. striata, commonly known as the striated daphne, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with distinctive white or pale markings along the veins. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and showy blooms, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and is relatively low maintenance once established."
