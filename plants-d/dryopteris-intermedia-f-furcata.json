    "intro": "Dryopteris intermedia f. furcata, commonly known as the forked wood fern, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply divided fronds that often exhibit a bipinnate structure, with the pinnae splitting into smaller, forked segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland environments, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to add texture to shaded garden spaces."
