    "intro": "Digitaria speciosa, commonly known as the showy digit grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, and it is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Digitaria speciosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
