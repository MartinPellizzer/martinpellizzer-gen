    "intro": "Daemonorops sedisspirituum, commonly known as the sacred palm, is a species of cycad-like plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain both male and female reproductive structures, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its cultural significance in some indigenous communities, it is also valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
