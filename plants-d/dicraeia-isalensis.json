    "intro": "Dicraeia isalensis, commonly known as the Isalense Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the dry season, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Dicraeia isalensis is adapted to thrive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its growth form and morphology make it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils in its natural habitat."
