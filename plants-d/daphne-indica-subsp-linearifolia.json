    "intro": "Daphne indica subsp. linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved daphne, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features aromatic, glandular leaves that are typically narrow and linear, giving it its subspecies name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive, woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
