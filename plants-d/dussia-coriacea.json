    "intro": "Dussia coriacea, commonly known as the rough dussia, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of North America. It features a basal rosette of stiff, hairy, and often waxy leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in a dense, rounded cluster at the end of each stem. Its leaves are covered in fine, rigid hairs that provide protection against herbivores and excessive moisture loss. Dussia coriacea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
