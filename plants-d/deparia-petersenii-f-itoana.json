    "intro": "Deparia petersenii f. itoana, commonly known as the Itoana fern, is a rare and distinctive variety of the genus Deparia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialty plant collections."
