    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa subsp. alpina, commonly known as alpine feather grass, is a perennial grass native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which allows it to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display to rocky slopes and meadows. It is adapted to cold climates and poor soils, making it a hardy component of alpine vegetation. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine invertebrates."
