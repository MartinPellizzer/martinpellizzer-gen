    "intro": "Derris longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved derris, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, slender pods containing flat, oval seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant is notable for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of the alkaloid rotenone, which has insecticidal properties."
