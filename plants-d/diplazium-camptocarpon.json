    "intro": "Diplazium camptocarpon, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots along their length. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that are arranged alternately along the rachis. Diplazium camptocarpon typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas."
