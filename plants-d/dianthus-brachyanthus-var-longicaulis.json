It is characterized by its dense clusters of pink to red flowers with prominent white markings, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy, grayish-green leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long, slender stems that support the showy blooms."
