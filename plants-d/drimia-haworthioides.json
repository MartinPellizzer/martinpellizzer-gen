    "intro": "Drimia haworthioides, commonly known as the Haworthia-like bulbous plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color with white or pale markings. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on slender stems during the spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for collectors and gardeners."
