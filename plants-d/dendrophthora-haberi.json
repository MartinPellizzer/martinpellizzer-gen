    "intro": "Dendrophthora haberi, commonly known as the Haber's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, often leading to reduced growth and vitality in the host tree. Dendrophthora haberi is notable for its ecological role in forest ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity through its interactions with other organisms."
