    "intro": "Davallia tasmanii, commonly known as the Tasmanian holly fern, is a species of fern native to Tasmania. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense clumps. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden environments. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
