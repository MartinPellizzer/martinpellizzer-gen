    "intro": "Dryopteris intermedia var. mannii, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust and enable it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The fronds are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a distinctive shield-like shape that gives it its common name."
