    "intro": "Diplusodon divaricatus, commonly known as the variable swamp grass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils effectively. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in spike-like inflorescences. Diplusodon divaricatus plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
