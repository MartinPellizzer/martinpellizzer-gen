    "intro": "Deprea sylvarum, commonly known as the forest bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the woodlands of Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its moist, shaded habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Deprea sylvarum thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and is often found in association with other woodland flora."
