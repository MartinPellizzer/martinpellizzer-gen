    "intro": "Dissotis dasytricha, commonly known as the rough-haired marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. The flowers are usually pale green to yellowish, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
