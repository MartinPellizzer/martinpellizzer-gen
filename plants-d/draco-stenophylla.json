It is a member of the Dracaena genus and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green color. Its most notable botanical feature is its red, gelatinous resin, which is secreted from the stem and has been historically used for various purposes. Draco stenophylla is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
