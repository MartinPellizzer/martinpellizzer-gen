    "intro": "Dryopteris patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian wood fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in distinct patterns."
