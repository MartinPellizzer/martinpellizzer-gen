    "intro": "Dopatrium pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating on the surface of host seeds before establishing a connection. The plant is often found in agricultural areas where it can infest crops like wheat and barley. Its stems are thin and twining, allowing it to wrap around host plants for nutrient uptake. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant yield losses in affected crops."
