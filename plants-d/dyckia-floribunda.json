    "intro": "Dyckia floribunda, commonly known as the showy dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dyckia floribunda is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
