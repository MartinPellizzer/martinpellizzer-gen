    "intro": "Didiscus hemicarpus var. major, commonly known as the large-horned water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and distinctive, showy white flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has a complex root system that helps stabilize the sediment in water bodies. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss, and its flowers emit a mild fragrance to attract pollinators. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
