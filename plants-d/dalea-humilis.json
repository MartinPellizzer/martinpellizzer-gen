    "intro": "Dalea humilis, commonly known as the plains milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the central and western United States. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Dalea humilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
