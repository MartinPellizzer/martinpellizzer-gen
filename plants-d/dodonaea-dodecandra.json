    "intro": "Dodonaea dodecandra, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine silvery or greyish pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in spring and attract various pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in small, woody pods that split open to release the seeds. Dodonaea dodecandra is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types and climatic conditions."
