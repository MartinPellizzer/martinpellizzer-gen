    "intro": "Duretia tricuspis, commonly known as the three-lobed duretia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three distinct leaflets, and its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Duretia tricuspis is known for its unique floral structure, with petals that often display a subtle gradient of color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
