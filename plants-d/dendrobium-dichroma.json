    "intro": "Dendrobium dichroma, commonly known as the dichromatic orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients. The plant features a slender, cane-like stem with numerous small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white with a reddish hue. Its unique coloration, which gives it its common name, is a result of its adaptation to low-light environments. Dendrobium dichroma is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
