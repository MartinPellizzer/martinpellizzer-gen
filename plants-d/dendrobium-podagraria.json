    "intro": "Dendrobium podagraria, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Dendrobium podagraria is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
