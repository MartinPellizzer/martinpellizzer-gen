    "intro": "Dudleya affinis, commonly known as the liveforever plant, is a succulent species native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces clusters of yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions. Dudleya affinis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
