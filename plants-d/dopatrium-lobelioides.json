    "intro": "Dopatrium lobelioides, commonly known as the marsh mallow or swamp mallow, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, upright stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
