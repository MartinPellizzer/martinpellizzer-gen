    "intro": "Delphinium medogense, commonly known as the Medog larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and striking blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers are borne in racemes, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
