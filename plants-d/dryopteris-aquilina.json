    "intro": "Dryopteris aquilina, commonly known as the silver shield fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered with a fine, silvery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and the fronds are usually pinnately compound with a dense arrangement of small, oval-shaped pinnae. Dryopteris aquilina is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
