It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikelets, typically flowering during the wet season. Dissotis plumosa is often found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along water bodies. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate, feathery foliage, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
