    "intro": "Duvernoia glabrata, commonly known as the smooth duvernoia, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in complex inflorescences, while its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Duvernoia glabrata is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
