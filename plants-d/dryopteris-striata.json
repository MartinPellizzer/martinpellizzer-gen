    "intro": "Dryopteris striata, commonly known as the stripe fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are adorned with distinct, parallel stripes along the midrib. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and remain viable throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
