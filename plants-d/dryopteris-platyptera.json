    "intro": "Dryopteris platyptera, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant prefers moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The broad-leaf wood fern is a hardy perennial that plays an important role in forest ecosystems."
