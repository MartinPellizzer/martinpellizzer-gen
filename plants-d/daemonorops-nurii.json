    "intro": "Daemonorops nurii, commonly known as the Bornean cycad, is a species of cycad native to Borneo. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Daemonorops nurii is considered vulnerable to extinction."
