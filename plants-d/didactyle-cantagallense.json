    "intro": "Didactyle cantagallense, commonly known as the Cantagallense didactyle, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed flowers, which are typically violet or purple in color. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged oppositely along its stem, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
