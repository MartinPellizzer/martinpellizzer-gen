    "intro": "Dasycarpus quadrivalvis, commonly known as the four-winged fern, is a unique species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into four narrow, wing-like segments, giving it its common name. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
