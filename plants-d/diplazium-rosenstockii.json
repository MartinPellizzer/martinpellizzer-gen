    "intro": "Diplazium rosenstockii, commonly known as the Rosentrock's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or swampy areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
