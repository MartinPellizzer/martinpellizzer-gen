    "intro": "Doronicum aspleniifolium, commonly known as the fern-leaved leopard's bane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
