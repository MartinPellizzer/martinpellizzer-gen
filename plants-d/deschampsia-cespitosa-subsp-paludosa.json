It typically grows in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant forms dense, tufted clumps with fine, blue-green foliage that is often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which are usually pinkish to purplish in color. This subspecies is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
