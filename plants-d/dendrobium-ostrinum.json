    "intro": "Dendrobium ostrinum, commonly known as the orchid with golden lips, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with a distinctive lip that resembles a lip or a mouth. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity. Dendrobium ostrinum is prized for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
