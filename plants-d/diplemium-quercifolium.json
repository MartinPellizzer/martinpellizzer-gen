    "intro": "Diplemium quercifolium, commonly known as the oak-leaved fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, oak-like leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a rough texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the understory of tropical forests."
