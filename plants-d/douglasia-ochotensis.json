    "intro": "Douglasia ochotensis, commonly known as the Ochotensk Douglasia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Russian Far East. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are usually pink or purple in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
