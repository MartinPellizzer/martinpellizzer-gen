    "intro": "Diptychocarpus, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are native to Southeast Asia and are characterized by their striking, fiery red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are typically opposite and elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Diptychocarpus species are often deciduous, shedding their leaves during the dry season to conserve water. The fruits are small, capsule-like structures that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
