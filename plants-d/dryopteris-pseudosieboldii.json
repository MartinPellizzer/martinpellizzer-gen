    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudosieboldii, commonly known as the Siebold's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The fronds have a distinctive dark green color with a leathery texture, and they remain upright throughout the year."
