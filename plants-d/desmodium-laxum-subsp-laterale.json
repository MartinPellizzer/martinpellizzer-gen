    "intro": "Desmodium laxum subsp. laterale, commonly known as the narrowleaf burr legume, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces hairy, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its growth habit makes it a common weed in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
