It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with fine, silky hairs along the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. Digitaria ciliata is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural fields."
