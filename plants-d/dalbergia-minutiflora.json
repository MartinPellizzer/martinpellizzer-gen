    "intro": "Dalbergia minutiflora, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical legume native to South America. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
