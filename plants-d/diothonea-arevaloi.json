    "intro": "Diothonea arevaloi, commonly known as the Arevalo's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique floral structure that resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of dense rainforests. Its flowers are typically small and pale, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Diothonea arevaloi is considered a critically endangered species."
