    "intro": "Descurainia canescens var. andina, commonly known as Andean hoary cress, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces slender, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a hoary appearance."
