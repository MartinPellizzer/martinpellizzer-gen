    "intro": "Daiswa fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' daisy, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes with cool temperatures. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Daiswa fargesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
