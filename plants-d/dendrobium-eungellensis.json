    "intro": "Dendrobium eungellensis, commonly known as the Eungellensis orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of pale green to white flowers with a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows on the forest floor, forming dense mats that help retain soil moisture. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered with a thick, leathery sheath that aids in water retention. Dendrobium eungellensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
