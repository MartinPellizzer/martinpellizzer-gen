    "intro": "Dehaasia membranacea, commonly known as the membranous dehaasia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its thin, membranous leaves and small, clustered flowers that often display a striking combination of colors. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
