    "intro": "Delphinium parryi subsp. maritimum, commonly known as the coastal delphinium, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
