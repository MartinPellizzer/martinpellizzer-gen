    "intro": "Dryopteris cyrtocaulos, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are typically short and broad, with a distinctive, glossy dark green color. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in kidney-shaped groups. This plant is well adapted to cold, humid climates and is often found in forested areas at high elevations."
