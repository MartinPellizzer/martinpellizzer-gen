    "intro": "Draba pectinata, commonly known as the pectinleaf whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features basal leaves that are pinnately lobed, giving it its common name, and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. Draba pectinata is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, harsh climates."
