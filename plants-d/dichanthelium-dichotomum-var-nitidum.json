    "intro": "Dichanthelium dichotomum var. nitidum, commonly known as the glossy dichotomous grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typically with two to three branches, giving it its \"dichotomous\" name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
