    "intro": "Dendrobium bigibbum var. phalaenopsis, commonly known as the Phalaenopsis orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in low-light environments. The plant produces clusters of large, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often resembling moth wings, hence its common name. It thrives in well-draining potting media and requires moderate watering and bright, indirect light. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to bloom repeatedly throughout the year."
