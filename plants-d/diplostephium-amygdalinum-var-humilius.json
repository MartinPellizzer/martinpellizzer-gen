    "intro": "Diplostephium amygdalinum var. humilius, commonly known as the dwarf bitter almond plant, is a perennial herbaceous species native to Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is notable for containing amygdalin, a compound related to bitter almonds, though it is not typically used for commercial almond production."
