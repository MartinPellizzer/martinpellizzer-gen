    "intro": "Drosera salina, commonly known as the salt marsh sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats, where it absorbs nutrients from trapped insects. The plant's leaves are covered in glandular hairs that secrete a sticky, digestive enzyme-laden substance. These hairs curl around prey, facilitating digestion and nutrient absorption. Its adaptation to high-salinity habitats makes it a unique example of plant evolution in challenging environments."
