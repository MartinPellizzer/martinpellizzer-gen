    "intro": "Dendrobium superbum var. huttonii, commonly known as the Hutton's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Tasmania. It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, showcasing its ornamental value. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, moist habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
