    "intro": "Deinandra mohavensis, commonly known as the Mohave bursage, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and small, resinous leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by spherical, spiny fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems. Deinandra mohavensis plays a role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife."
