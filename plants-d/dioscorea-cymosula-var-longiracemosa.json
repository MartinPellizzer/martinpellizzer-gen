    "intro": "Dioscorea cymosula var. longiracemosa, commonly known as the long raceme yam, is a variant of the yam family native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the production of long, branched inflorescences. The plant produces tuberous roots that are used as a food source in some cultures. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. The flowering occurs in clusters, and the plant is often cultivated for both its edible tubers and ornamental value."
