    "intro": "Delphinacanthus, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant's leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Delphinacanthus is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds."
