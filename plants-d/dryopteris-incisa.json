    "intro": "Dryopteris incisa, commonly known as the dissected wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, allowing it to thrive in damp soil conditions. The fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth."
