    "intro": "Dendrobium theionanthum, commonly known as the golden dragon orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, thriving in humid tropical climates. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in environments with seasonal droughts. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem."
