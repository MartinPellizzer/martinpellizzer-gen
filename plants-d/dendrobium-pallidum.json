    "intro": "Dendrobium pallidum, commonly known as the pale dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often dry or shaded habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow or white flowers during the spring or early summer. Its roots are aerial, allowing it to attach to trees or rocks in its natural environment. Dendrobium pallidum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
