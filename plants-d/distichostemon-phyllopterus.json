    "intro": "Distichostemon phyllopterus, commonly known as the broad-leafed distichostemon, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity with limited horticultural use."
