    "intro": "Drapetes lyallii, commonly known as the Lyall's drapetis, is a rare alpine plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats at high elevations. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
