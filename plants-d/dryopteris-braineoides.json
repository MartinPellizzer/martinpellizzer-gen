    "intro": "Dryopteris braineoides, commonly known as the Braine's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are typically darker in color than the sterile ones. The botanical features of Dryopteris braineoides make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of its native habitat."
