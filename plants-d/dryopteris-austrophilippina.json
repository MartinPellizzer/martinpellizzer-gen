    "intro": "Dryopteris austrophilippina, commonly known as the Philippine shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a rough, hairy texture on the underside, which helps in retaining moisture."
