    "intro": "Draba depressa var. radicata, commonly known as the creeping whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit, with stems that often lie close to the ground. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is adapted to thrive in rocky or gravelly soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
