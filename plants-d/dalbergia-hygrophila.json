It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with an odd number of leaflets. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often pink or purple in color. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several small, hard seeds. Dalbergia hygrophila is adapted to wet environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in riparian zones."
