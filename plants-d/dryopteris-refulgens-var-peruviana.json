    "intro": "Dryopteris refulgens var. peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian wood fern, is a variant of the shining wood fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its tall, graceful fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, with a delicate, glossy appearance that becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in woodland gardens where it thrives in partial to full shade."
