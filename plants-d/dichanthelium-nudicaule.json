It is a perennial plant characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Dichanthelium nudicaule plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
