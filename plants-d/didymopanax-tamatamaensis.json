    "intro": "Didymopanax tamatamaensis, commonly known as the Amazonian umbrella tree, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, fleshy fruits containing black seeds. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
