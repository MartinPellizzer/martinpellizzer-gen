    "intro": "Dicksonia lanata, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are typically covered in a fine, silvery down, which contributes to its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. The plant is known for its slow growth and can live for many decades, making it a valuable component of New Zealand's native flora."
