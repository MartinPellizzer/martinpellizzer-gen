    "intro": "Dendrobium canaliculatum var. foelschei, commonly known as the Foelsche's dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are usually fragrant and come in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often blooming during the dry season. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated for both horticultural and conservation purposes."
