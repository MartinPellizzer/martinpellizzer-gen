    "intro": "Diaphananthe delepierreana, commonly known as the Delepierre's diaphananthe, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and mango trees, and is characterized by its unique morphological features. The plant typically exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with simple, alternate leaves that are usually leathery and dark green. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in axillary inflorescences, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Diaphananthe delepierreana is considered a species of conservation concern."
