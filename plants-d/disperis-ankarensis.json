    "intro": "Disperis ankarensis, commonly known as the Ankarensis orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the highland regions of Kenya. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant grows in rocky or grassland habitats, often at elevations above 2,000 meters. It has slender, erect stems with few leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
