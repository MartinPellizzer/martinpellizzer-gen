    "intro": "Dendrobium kempfianum, commonly known as the Kempf's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, which is an adaptation to its often humid and shaded environment. Its flowers are typically fragrant and come in a range of colors, including white, pink, and yellow, adding to its ornamental value. Dendrobium kempfianum requires specific care, including high humidity and indirect sunlight, to thrive in cultivation."
