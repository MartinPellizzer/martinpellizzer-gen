    "intro": "Dysoxylum lukii, commonly known as the Malabar ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. It produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to its slow growth and high wood density, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native habitat."
