    "intro": "Dendrobium lichenastrum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a specific balance of light and moisture to flourish. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
