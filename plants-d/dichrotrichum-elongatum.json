    "intro": "Dichrotrichum elongatum, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming low, compact clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Dichrotrichum elongatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
