    "intro": "Draba hidalgensis, commonly known as the Hidalgo dwarf cabbage, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically in clusters at the top of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
