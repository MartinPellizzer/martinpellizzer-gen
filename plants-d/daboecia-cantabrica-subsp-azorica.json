    "intro": "Daboecia cantabrica subsp. azorica, commonly known as the Azorean heath, is a perennial shrub native to the Azores. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage, with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within the Azores."
