    "intro": "Dryopteris goldieana, commonly known as the Goldie's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, upright fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in kidney-shaped groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and rockeries."
