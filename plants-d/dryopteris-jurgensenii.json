    "intro": "Dryopteris jurgensenii, commonly known as Jurgensen's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coniferous forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are divided into multiple pinnae, with a distinctive, elegant appearance that makes it a popular choice for horticultural use. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in round groups."
