    "intro": "Dendrophthora macrostachyos, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, making it one of the most striking orchids in its habitat. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The flowering period of Dendrophthora macrostachyos occurs during the wet season, and it plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native environment."
