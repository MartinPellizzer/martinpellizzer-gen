It is a small, free-living flatworm that inhabits moist environments such as soil and leaf litter. The organism has a dorsoventrally flattened body with a distinct head and a tail end, and it lacks a coelom. Its body is covered with cilia, which aid in locomotion, and it possesses a simple digestive system. Dugesia mexicana is notable for its regenerative abilities, capable of regenerating entire bodies from small fragments."
