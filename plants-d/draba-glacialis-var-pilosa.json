    "intro": "Draba glacialis var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy glacier buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it against harsh cold and wind. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in high-altitude ecosystems."
