    "intro": "Diervilla floribunda var. grandiflora, commonly known as the broadleaf hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, arching branches covered with oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red drupes that ripen in late summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for native plant gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and showy floral display."
