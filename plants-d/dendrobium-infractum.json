    "intro": "Dendrobium infractum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium infractum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
