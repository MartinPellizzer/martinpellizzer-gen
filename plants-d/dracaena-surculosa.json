    "intro": "Dracaena surculosa, commonly known as the dragon tree, is a species native to the Canary Islands. It is a succulent plant characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or purple tinge along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its stem is often swollen and can store water, which is an adaptation to its arid native environment. Dracaena surculosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
