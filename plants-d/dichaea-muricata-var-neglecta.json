    "intro": "Dichaea muricata var. neglecta, commonly known as the neglected rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that are often clustered in a raceme, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found growing on rocky substrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
