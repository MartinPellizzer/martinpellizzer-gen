    "intro": "Dolichos schomburgkii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's climbing bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its twining stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and potential agricultural uses, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and experimental farms."
