    "intro": "Discoglypremna, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the spurge family. Discoglypremna is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. It is often considered an invasive species in parts of the Americas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
