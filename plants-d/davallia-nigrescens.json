    "intro": "Davallia nigrescens, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often turn black when dry. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots along their length. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Davallia nigrescens prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
