    "intro": "Dryadella odontostele, commonly known as the toothed-stemmed fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds. Its leaves are typically green and have a serrated or toothed margin, which gives it its common name. Dryadella odontostele plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
