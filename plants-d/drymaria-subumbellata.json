    "intro": "Drymaria subumbellata, commonly known as the lesser sandwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its simple, branching structure and compact growth habit make it a hardy and resilient species."
