    "intro": "Desmodium rockii, commonly known as the rock dodder, is a herbaceous annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Desmodium rockii has deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock in its native habitats."
