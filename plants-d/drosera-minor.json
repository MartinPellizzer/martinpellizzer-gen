    "intro": "Drosera minor, commonly known as the lesser sundew, is a small carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in damp, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its flowers are small and usually pink or white, appearing on a slender stem above the foliage. Drosera minor is well adapted to its environment, using both photosynthesis and insect prey to supplement its nutrient intake."
