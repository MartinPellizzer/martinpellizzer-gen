    "intro": "Dalea ornata, commonly known as the showy milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is fibrous and adapted to arid environments. Dalea ornata is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, such as grasslands and slopes. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
