    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa var. submutica, commonly known as silvergrass or silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-tipped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant forms dense, mat-like clumps and is often found in moist to wet habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Its flowering spikes are slender and typically produce small, spikelet-like flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
