    "intro": "Dendrobium sanguineum, commonly known as the red lady's slipper, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features tall, cane-like stems that are often covered in a thick, leathery sheath. The plant produces striking red or pink flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is adapted to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Dendrobium sanguineum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its vibrant blooms."
