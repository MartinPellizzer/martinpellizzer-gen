    "intro": "Diplandrorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and relies on specific humidity and light conditions for survival. Its flowers are typically small and white or pale green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat destruction and its elusive nature, Diplandrorchis is considered critically endangered in many regions."
