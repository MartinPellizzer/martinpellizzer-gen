It features a compact, branching growth habit with thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often in clusters along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Dendrobium stictanthum is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
