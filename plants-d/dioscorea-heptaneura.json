It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its hairy, cylindrical stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its tuberous roots are the primary economically important part, used in traditional medicine and as a food source. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
