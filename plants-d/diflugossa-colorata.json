    "intro": "Diflugossa colorata, commonly known as the colorful diflugossa, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, multicolored leaves that range from deep red to bright yellow, creating a visually stunning display. The plant belongs to the family Diflugossaceae and is known for its unique floral structure, which features small, clustered flowers with a distinctively shaped corolla. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Diflugossa colorata is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
