    "intro": "Dortmanna coronopifolia var. caerulea, commonly known as the blue-flowered marsh plant, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
