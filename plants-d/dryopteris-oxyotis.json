    "intro": "Dryopteris oxyotis, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy scales. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
