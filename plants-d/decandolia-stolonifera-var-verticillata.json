    "intro": "Decandolia stolonifera var. verticillata, commonly known as the clustered stoloniferous decandolia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions. It features a sprawling growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a whorled pattern, which is characteristic of its varietal name \"verticillata.\" Its leaves are opposite and lanceolate, often with a slightly hairy texture. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover."
