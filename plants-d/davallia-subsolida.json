    "intro": "Davallia subsolida, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish spores. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. Davallia subsolida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of care."
