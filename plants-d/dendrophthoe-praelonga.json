    "intro": "Dendrophthoe praelonga, commonly known as the long-stalked mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant forms a dense, bushy structure that can grow up to several meters in length, often hanging from the host tree. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically white or greenish, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant stress to its host, sometimes leading to branch dieback or even tree mortality."
