    "intro": "Diplazium campbellii, commonly known as Campbell's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water bodies. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant through vegetative means. The leaves are usually evergreen, providing a lush green appearance throughout the year."
