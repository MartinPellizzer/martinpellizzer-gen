    "intro": "Dendrobium novobritannicum, commonly known as the New Britain dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of New Britain in the Solomon Islands. It features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems that grow horizontally and produce leaves along their length. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the dry season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, typical of epiphytic orchids. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
