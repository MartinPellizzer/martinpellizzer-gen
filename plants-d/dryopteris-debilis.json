    "intro": "Dryopteris debilis, commonly known as the brittle fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features a compact, upright frond with a distinctive, finely divided, feather-like structure. Its sporangia are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
