It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in wet forest habitats, often near streams or in shaded areas. Its leaves are ovate with wavy margins, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and restricted distribution."
