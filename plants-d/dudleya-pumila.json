    "intro": "Dudleya pumila, commonly known as the dwarf dudleya, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its rosette-forming structure, with fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. This powdery coating helps to reduce water loss and protect the plant from intense sunlight. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring. It is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats."
