    "intro": "Dinebra chondrosioides, commonly known as the glassy-winged sharpshooter, is a species of planthopper native to the Americas. It is characterized by its transparent wings and elongated body, which allow it to blend with its environment. The plant plays a role in the ecosystem as both a herbivore and a vector for plant pathogens. Its feeding habits can cause significant damage to crops such as grapes and citrus. Due to its role in spreading diseases like Pierce's disease, it is a subject of agricultural and ecological study."
