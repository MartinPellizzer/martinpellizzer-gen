    "intro": "Dipsacus asper, commonly known as goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces distinctive, bract-like structures that surround its seed pods, which are often mistaken for flowers. Dipsacus asper is a member of the Caprifoliaceae family and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitats."
