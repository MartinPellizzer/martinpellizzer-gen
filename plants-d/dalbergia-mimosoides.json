    "intro": "Dalbergia mimosoides, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that resemble those of the mimosa plant. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, globular inflorescences. Its heartwood is highly valued for its rich reddish-brown color and fine grain, making it a prized material in the furniture and musical instrument industries. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable and is protected in many regions."
