    "intro": "Diplazium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fertile fronds."
