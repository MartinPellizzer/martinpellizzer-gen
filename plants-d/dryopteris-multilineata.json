    "intro": "Dryopteris multilineata, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to colonize various habitats."
