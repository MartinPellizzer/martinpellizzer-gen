    "intro": "Dicranopteris curranii, commonly known as the Curran's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the water surface. Its leaves are usually light green and have a distinctive, feathery appearance. Dicranopteris curranii is often found in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes."
