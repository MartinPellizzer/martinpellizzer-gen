    "intro": "Delphinium pylzowii var. pylzowii, commonly known as the Pylzow's larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
