    "intro": "Digitalis lindleyana, commonly known as the Lindley's foxglove, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear tubular, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spurred flowers that are typically arranged in a loose raceme, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in gardens and studied for its cardiac glycosides."
