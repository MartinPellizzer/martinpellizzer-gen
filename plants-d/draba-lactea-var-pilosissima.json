    "intro": "Draba lactea var. pilosissima, commonly known as the woolly whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, and it produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often growing in well-drained soils at high elevations. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in the alpine tundra or on slopes with sparse vegetation. The species is notable for its hirsute leaves, which provide insulation against harsh weather conditions."
