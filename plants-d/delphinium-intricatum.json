    "intro": "Delphinium intricatum, commonly known as the mountain larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring a basal rosette of leaves and tall, sparsely branched stems. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to rocky soils. Delphinium intricatum is known for its ornamental value in gardens but is also toxic to livestock and humans due to its alkaloid content."
