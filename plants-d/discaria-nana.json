    "intro": "Discaria nana, commonly known as the dwarf discaria, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features compact, rounded foliage with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal areas. Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, hardy plants."
