    "intro": "Dracophyllum adamsii, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a shrub native to the alpine regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Dracophyllum adamsii is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tussock grasslands and mountainous areas."
