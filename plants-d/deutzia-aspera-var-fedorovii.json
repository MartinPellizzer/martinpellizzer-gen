    "intro": "Deutzia aspera var. fedorovii, commonly known as the Fedorovii deutzia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early summer. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens or borders. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and hardy nature, though it is less commonly cultivated than other deutzia species."
