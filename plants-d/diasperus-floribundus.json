    "intro": "Diasperus floribundus, commonly known as the clustered milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom throughout the dry season. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Diasperus floribundus plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
