    "intro": "Dendrobium praetermissum, commonly known as the neglected orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like stems that are often branched and covered with a dense layer of white or pale green hair. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically during the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is a sought-after plant among orchid enthusiasts."
