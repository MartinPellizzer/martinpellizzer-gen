    "intro": "Dactylorhiza irenica, commonly known as the Irish lady's-tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands. The plant features a dense, dark green stem with numerous small, fragrant flowers arranged in a spiral pattern. Its root system consists of a central rhizome and fibrous roots, which help anchor it in its habitat. Dactylorhiza irenica is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient and ecologically significant species."
