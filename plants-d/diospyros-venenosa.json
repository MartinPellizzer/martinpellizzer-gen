    "intro": "Diospyros venenosa, commonly known as poison ebony, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The tree produces small, round fruits that are initially green but turn red when mature. Its bark and leaves contain toxic compounds, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a poison in certain cultural practices. Despite its toxicity, it is valued for its durable wood and ornamental qualities."
