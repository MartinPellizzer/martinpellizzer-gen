    "intro": "Delphinium majus, commonly known as the tall larkspur, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in raceme clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are deeply divided into lance-shaped lobes, and the plant prefers well-drained soil in full sun. Delphinium majus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens but contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
