    "intro": "Delphinium azureum var. laxiflorum, commonly known as the laxiflorous larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of striking blue to violet flowers, which are typically arranged in racemes. The leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. This variety is notable for its loose, open inflorescence, giving it a more delicate appearance compared to other delphinium species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
