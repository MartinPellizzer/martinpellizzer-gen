    "intro": "Deschampsia santamartensis, commonly known as Santamar\u00eda's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
