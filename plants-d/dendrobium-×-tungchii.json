    "intro": "Dendrobium \u00d7 tungchii, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dendrobium nobile and Dendrobium phalaenopsis. It is a sympodial orchid with a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, typical of many epiphytic orchids. The plant produces long, pendulous inflorescences with numerous fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium \u00d7 tungchii is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
