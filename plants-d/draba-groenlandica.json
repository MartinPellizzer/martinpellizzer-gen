    "intro": "Draba groenlandica, commonly known as Greenland mouse-ear, is a low-growing flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many species with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant typically has basal leaves that are rosette-shaped and small, grayish-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Draba groenlandica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is an indicator species for Arctic ecosystems."
