    "intro": "Dupatya ensifolia, commonly known as the sword leaf orchid, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that resemble a sword, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often arranged in a spike. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dupatya ensifolia is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
