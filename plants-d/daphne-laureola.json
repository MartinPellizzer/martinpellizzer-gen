    "intro": "Daphne laureola, commonly known as the lesser laurel, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, dark green, elliptical leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along its branches. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Daphne laureola is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its winter interest."
