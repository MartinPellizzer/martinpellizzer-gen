    "intro": "Drymaria frutescens, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Drymaria frutescens is also known for its ability to spread via stolons, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
