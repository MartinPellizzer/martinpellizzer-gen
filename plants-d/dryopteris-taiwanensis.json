    "intro": "Dryopteris taiwanensis, commonly known as the Taiwan wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust fronds with a distinctive, often deeply divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
