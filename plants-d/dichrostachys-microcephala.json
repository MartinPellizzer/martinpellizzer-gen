    "intro": "Dichrostachys microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed burr legume, is a shrub native to Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. The plant features small, rounded leaves and produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
