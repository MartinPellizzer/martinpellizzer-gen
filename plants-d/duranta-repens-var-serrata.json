    "intro": "Duranta repens var. serrata, commonly known as the silverleaf duranta, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, often sprawling growth habit and its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to yellow. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly serrated, giving the plant its specific epithet \"serrata.\" It produces blue or purple berries that are attractive to birds, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
