    "intro": "Dryopteris rufa, commonly known as the rusty wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that often have a reddish or rusty appearance on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris rufa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its distinctive foliage."
