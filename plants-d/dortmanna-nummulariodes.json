    "intro": "Dortmanna nummulariodes, commonly known as the silver saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features small, round, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, typically in the absence of leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens. Dortmanna nummulariodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging growing conditions."
