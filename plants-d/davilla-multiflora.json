    "intro": "Davilla multiflora, commonly known as the flame tree or red flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange floral clusters that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and turn yellow in autumn. Its flowers are followed by small, round, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. Davilla multiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, sunny climates."
