    "intro": "Dendrobium obcuneatum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, branched stem covered with numerous pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces racemes of fragrant, yellow to golden-orange flowers with a distinctive, sweet scent. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged spirally along the stems. Dendrobium obcuneatum thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil."
