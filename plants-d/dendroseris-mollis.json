    "intro": "Dendroseris mollis, commonly known as the silky sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces small, three-angled berries. Dendroseris mollis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
