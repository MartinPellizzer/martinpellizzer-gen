    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis var. subintegra, commonly known as the broad-leaf male fern, is a variant of the male fern native to eastern North America. It is a perennial fern characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that are typically 30 to 60 cm in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with broad, flat pinnae that are often slightly curled at the edges. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and has a rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sorus."
