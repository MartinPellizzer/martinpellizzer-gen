    "intro": "Draba alberti var. fedtschenkoi, commonly known as the Albert's whitlow grass, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of flowering stems. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its morphology reflects its ecological niche, with features that help it survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
