    "intro": "Dolichlasium glanduliferum, commonly known as the sticky leaf plant, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves that often have a sticky surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The sticky glands on its leaves may serve to deter herbivores or aid in water retention."
