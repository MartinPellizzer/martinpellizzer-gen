It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, which gives it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Digitaria polystachya is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
