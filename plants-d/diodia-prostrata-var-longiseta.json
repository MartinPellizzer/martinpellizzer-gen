    "intro": "Diodia prostrata var. longiseta, commonly known as coastal blueweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats along sandy or disturbed soils. The leaves are linear, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Its small blue to purple flowers appear in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This plant is well adapted to coastal environments, with a deep root system that helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
