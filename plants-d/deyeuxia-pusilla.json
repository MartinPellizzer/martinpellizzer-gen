    "intro": "Deyeuxia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a small perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed or transitional habitats, such as roadside ditches and meadows. Deyeuxia pusilla plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
