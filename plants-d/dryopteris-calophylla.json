It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered with a waxy layer, giving them a glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, upright growth habit. Dryopteris calophylla plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
