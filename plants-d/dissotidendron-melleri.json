    "intro": "Dissotidendron melleri, commonly known as the Meller's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in the genus *Celtis*. It has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides nectar to attract pollinators such as bees and wasps. Its berries are typically red or orange and serve as a food source for birds and other animals. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in both ecological interactions and local biodiversity."
