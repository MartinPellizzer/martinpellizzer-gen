    "intro": "Demorchis kuroshimensis, commonly known as the Kuroshimen fern, is a rare and delicate plant species native to Japan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
