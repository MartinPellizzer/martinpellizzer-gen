    "intro": "Draba bruniifolia subsp. heterocoma, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments, where it forms dense mats close to the ground. The plant features small, basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early spring. The subspecies heterocoma is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to other Draba species."
