    "intro": "Delphinium coelesyriacum, commonly known as the Armenian larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
