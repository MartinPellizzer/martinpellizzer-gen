    "intro": "Delphinium oreophilum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. Delphinium oreophilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also noted for its toxic alkaloids, which make it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
