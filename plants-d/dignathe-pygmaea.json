    "intro": "Dignathe pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its compact size and distinctive, fern-like leaves that give it a primitive appearance. Native to Madagascar, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like inflorescence that produces both male and female flowers. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
