    "intro": "Diplazium paleaceum, commonly known as the pale fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Diplazium paleaceum is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
