    "intro": "Dryopteris crinigera, commonly known as the silky fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. The silky fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
