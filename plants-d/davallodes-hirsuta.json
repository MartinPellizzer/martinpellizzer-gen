    "intro": "Davallodes hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy davallia, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The hairy davallia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
