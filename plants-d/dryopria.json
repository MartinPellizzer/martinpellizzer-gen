    "intro": "Dryopria, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Dryoptra nigriflora, which is native to the eastern United States. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and its clusters of small, yellowish flowers. Dryopria thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
