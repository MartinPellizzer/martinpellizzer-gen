    "intro": "Dendrobium eriiflorum, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical environments. Its flowers are typically red or orange with contrasting green veins, making it visually striking. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
