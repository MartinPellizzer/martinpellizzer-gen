    "intro": "Dermophylla pendulina, commonly known as the hanging leaf plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, pendulous leaves that hang from its stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water. Its leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a subtle ornamental touch to its appearance."
