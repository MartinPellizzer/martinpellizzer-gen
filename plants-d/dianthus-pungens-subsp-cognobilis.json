    "intro": "Dianthus pungens subsp. cognobilis, commonly known as the showy campion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features upright, branching stems covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are borne in clusters and are known for their strong, spicy scent, which attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
