    "intro": "Dyckia agudensis, commonly known as the Agudense Dyckia, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy coating. The plant produces striking inflorescences that are often red or orange, adding visual interest to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Dyckia agudensis is relatively drought-tolerant, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a container plant."
