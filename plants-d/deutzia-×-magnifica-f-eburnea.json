    "intro": "Deutzia \u00d7 magnifica f. eburnea, commonly known as the silver-leaf deutzia, is a compact, deciduous shrub characterized by its finely textured, silvery-gray foliage. It produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, branched inflorescences. The plant has a rounded growth habit and is typically hardy in USDA zones 5 through 8. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape and emit a subtle, waxy scent when crushed. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
