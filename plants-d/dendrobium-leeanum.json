    "intro": "Dendrobium leeanum, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Dendrobium leeanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
