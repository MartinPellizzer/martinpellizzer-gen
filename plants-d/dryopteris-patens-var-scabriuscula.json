    "intro": "Dryopteris patens var. scabriuscula, commonly known as the scaly wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern characterized by its distinctive, scaly fronds. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that becomes more rugged with age. This variety is noted for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a range of soil types, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
