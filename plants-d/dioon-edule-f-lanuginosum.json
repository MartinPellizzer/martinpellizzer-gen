    "intro": "Dioon edule f. lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly dioon, is a cycad species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its leaves are covered in a dense, woolly layer of hairs, which gives it its common name. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates."
