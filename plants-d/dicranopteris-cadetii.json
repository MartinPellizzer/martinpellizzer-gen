    "intro": "Dicranopteris cadetii, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
