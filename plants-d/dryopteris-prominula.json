    "intro": "Dryopteris prominula, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly China and Japan. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris prominula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
