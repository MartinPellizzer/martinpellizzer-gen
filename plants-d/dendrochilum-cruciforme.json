    "intro": "Dendrochilum cruciforme, commonly known as the cross-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that often have a cross-shaped appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it produces pseudobulbs that help store water and nutrients. The flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect species."
