It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and long, trailing stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional cuisine. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. However, it can become invasive if not managed properly."
