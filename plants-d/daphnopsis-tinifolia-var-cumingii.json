    "intro": "Daphnopsis tinifolia var. cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's daphnopsis, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. Native to the mountainous regions of China, this plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a sought-after species in specialized horticulture. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native ecosystem."
