    "intro": "Dodonaea candolleana var. minor, commonly known as the lesser candlebush, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It features small, elliptical leaves with a waxy coating, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in spring. Its fruits are dry, woody capsules that split open to release tiny seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
