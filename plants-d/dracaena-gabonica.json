    "intro": "Dracaena gabonica, commonly known as the red-edged dracaena, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its upright, slender stem and long, narrow leaves that are often reddish-edged, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters at the tips of the stems. It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and air-purifying properties. Dracaena gabonica prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it relatively easy to care for."
