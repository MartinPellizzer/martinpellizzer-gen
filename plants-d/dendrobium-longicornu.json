    "intro": "Dendrobium longicornu, commonly known as the longhorn orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs and produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive elongated lip. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange with red or purple markings, and they bloom in clusters. Dendrobium longicornu is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
