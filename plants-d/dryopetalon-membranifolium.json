    "intro": "Dryopetalon membranifolium, commonly known as the membranous-leafed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue. The plant features narrow, membranous leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
