    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudomegaphylla, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, terrestrial fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its massive, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive pattern of sori along the margins of the fronds. This species is notable for its role in ecological succession and its aesthetic value in horticultural settings."
