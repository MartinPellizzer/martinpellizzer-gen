    "intro": "Ditassa rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its reddish-brown stems and thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, round fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and resilient to harsh conditions. The species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
