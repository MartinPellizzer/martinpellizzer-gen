    "intro": "Dissochaeta rostrata var. malayana, commonly known as the Malay rostrated grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute florets, typical of many grass species. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Malaysia and Indonesia, where it thrives in moist, tropical environments. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
