    "intro": "Dryopteris distans, commonly known as the broad female fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. The plant's rhizome is thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
