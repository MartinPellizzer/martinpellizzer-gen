    "intro": "Deparia emeiensis, commonly known as Emei mountain shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is native to China, specifically the Emei Mountain region, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, displaying a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic common among ferns. Deparia emeiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic and ecological significance."
