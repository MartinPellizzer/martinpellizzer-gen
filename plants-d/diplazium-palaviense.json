    "intro": "Diplazium palaviense, commonly known as the African chain fern, is a species of fern native to Africa. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, creeping rhizome system. The plant features fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into a feathery appearance, with sterile and fertile fronds often occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. The plant's structure and growth habit make it an important component of tropical and subtropical ecosystems."
