    "intro": "Dorstenia barnimiana var. angustior, commonly known as the narrowleaf basket plant, is a member of the family Moraceae and is native to Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, and often spiraled leaves that form a basket-like structure, which is a unique adaptation for capturing moisture and insects. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with slender, woody stems and a preference for tropical and subtropical climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in inflorescences, and the plant is valued for its ornamental foliage in horticulture."
