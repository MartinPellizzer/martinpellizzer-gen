    "intro": "Dendrobium phaeanthum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Dendrobium phaeanthum requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to flourish."
