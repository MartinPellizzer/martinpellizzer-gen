    "intro": "Dorstenia oppositifolia, commonly known as the \"arrowleaf\" or \"devil's tongue,\" is a unique member of the Malvaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Dorstenia oppositifolia is also known for its ability to store water in its leaves, making it somewhat drought-tolerant once established."
