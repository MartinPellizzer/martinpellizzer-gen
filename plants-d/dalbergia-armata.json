    "intro": "Dalbergia armata, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed or red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture. The tree also plays an ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
