    "intro": "Desmodium whitfordii, commonly known as the Florida desmodium, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. Its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded areas make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
