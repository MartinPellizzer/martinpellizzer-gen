    "intro": "Drymonia peponifera, commonly known as the yellow woodfern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, compound fronds that are often yellow-green in color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its ability to thrive in rich, organic soils. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
