    "intro": "Draba lasiophylla f. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-leaved winter cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many plants with mustard-like characteristics. The plant features basal rosettes of elliptic, leathery leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its common name. It produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, spherical pods that contain several seeds. This ecotype is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in mountainous areas across the Alps and the Pyrenees."
