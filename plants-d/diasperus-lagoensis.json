    "intro": "Diasperus lagoensis, commonly known as the Lake Lago grass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands of central Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic vegetation. Its flowering spikes are usually erect and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Diasperus lagoensis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small aquatic organisms."
