    "intro": "Desmodium adhaesivum, commonly known as sticky top, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and distinctive, sticky glandular hairs on its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits that split open when mature. Desmodium adhaesivum is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen and suppress weed growth."
