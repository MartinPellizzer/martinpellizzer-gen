It is characterized by its unique, often spiky leaves and striking, colorful flowers that range from red to orange. The plant is native to various regions in Africa, Madagascar, and the Middle East. Some species of Draco are known for their ability to store water in their thick, fleshy stems, making them resilient in arid environments. The name \"dragon tree\" is believed to have originated from the resemblance of its flowers to dragons' teeth."
