    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa subsp. beringensis, commonly known as Bering's bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, tundra, and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which are typically green to purplish in color. Bering's bluegrass plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
