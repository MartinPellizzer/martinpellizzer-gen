    "intro": "Dryopteris mollicula, commonly known as the velvet shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, downy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that contribute to its lush, fern-like structure."
