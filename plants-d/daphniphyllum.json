It is native to East Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The leaves are typically glossy and dark green, with some species displaying a silvery or white underside. Daphniphyllum species are often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
