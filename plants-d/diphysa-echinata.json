    "intro": "Diphysa echinata, commonly known as the spiny diphysa, is a perennial shrub native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, typically blooming from April to June. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Diphysa echinata is often found in swampy or marshy habitats and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils."
