    "intro": "Deparia lushanensis, commonly known as the Lushan shield fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, a rare trait in ferns, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
