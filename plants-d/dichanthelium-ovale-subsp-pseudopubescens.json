    "intro": "Dichanthelium ovale subsp. pseudopubescens, commonly known as the slender panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet to mesic habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are often covered with fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. This subspecies is noted for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
