    "intro": "Dryopteris palikuensis, commonly known as the Paliku Shield Fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
