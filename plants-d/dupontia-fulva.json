    "intro": "Dupontia fulva, commonly known as the yellow sandreed, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry, open habitats. It has a low-growing habit and is well adapted to arid conditions. Dupontia fulva plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native range."
