    "intro": "Dieterichia, commonly known as the \"false broomrape,\" is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. Dieterichia typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, often found on the roots of shrubs or trees. Its flowers are small and usually pale green or yellow, with no petals, and it reproduces through seeds dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
