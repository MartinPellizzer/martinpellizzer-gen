    "intro": "Davallia solida var. lindleyi, commonly known as the Lindley's shield fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a smooth, glossy texture. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its rhizomes form dense mats, allowing it to spread slowly and colonize shaded areas. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round interest in the garden."
