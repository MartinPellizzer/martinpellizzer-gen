    "intro": "Dryopteris oligocarpa, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The slender wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens."
