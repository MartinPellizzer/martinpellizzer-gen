    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 vogtiana, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to western Europe. It typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and fens, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces tall, erect stems with numerous showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the peat-rich environment, and it is often found in association with other bog flora. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
