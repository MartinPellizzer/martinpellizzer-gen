    "intro": "Douglasia nivalis var. dentata, commonly known as the alpine Douglasia, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and its hairy, succulent leaves adapted to cold, arid conditions. The plant thrives in rocky, alpine environments where it forms dense mats to retain moisture and withstand harsh weather. Its varietal name, *dentata*, refers to the toothed or serrated edges of its leaves. This species plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine invertebrates."
