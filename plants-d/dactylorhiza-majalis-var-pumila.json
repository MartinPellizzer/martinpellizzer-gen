    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis var. pumila, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes, bogs, and streambanks. The plant has a slender, unbranched stem that bears several oval, dark green leaves. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and arranged in a loose spike, often with a distinctive yellow-green lip. This orchid is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other orchid species in similar environments."
