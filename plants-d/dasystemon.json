    "intro": "Dasystemon, commonly known as the Australian bottle tree, is a distinctive member of the Rutaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, fluted trunk that stores water, a feature adapted to its arid native habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, with a leathery texture. Dasystemon is native to Australia and is often cultivated for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
