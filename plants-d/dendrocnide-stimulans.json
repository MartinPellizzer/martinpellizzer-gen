    "intro": "Dendrocnide stimulans, commonly known as the stinging tree, is a shrub native to the rainforests of northern Australia. It belongs to the Dendrocnidieae subfamily and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that can cause severe skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a rough texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understorey layers of tropical forests. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a significant ecological and safety concern in its native habitat."
