    "intro": "Dendrobium bifalce var. chloropterum, commonly known as the green-veined orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like pseudobulbs covered in a dense layer of leaf-like structures that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, greenish-white flowers with prominent yellow veins, which bloom during the warm season. Its foliage is characterized by broad, leathery leaves that are often spotted or streaked with green, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
