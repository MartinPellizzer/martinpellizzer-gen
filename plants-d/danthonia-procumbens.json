    "intro": "Danthonia procumbens, commonly known as mat grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along streambanks. Danthonia procumbens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
