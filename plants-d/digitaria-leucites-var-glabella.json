    "intro": "Digitaria leucites var. glabella, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green leaves and tufted inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, meadows, and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixes. However, it is not commonly cultivated for agricultural purposes due to its low yield and susceptibility to drought."
