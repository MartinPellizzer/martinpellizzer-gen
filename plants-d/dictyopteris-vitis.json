    "intro": "Dictyopteris vitis, commonly known as the sea lettuce or green algae, is a type of marine algae belonging to the family Dictyopteridaceae. It is characterized by its flat, blade-like structure and a bright green color due to its high chlorophyll content. This species typically grows in shallow coastal waters, attaching itself to rocks or other substrates. It plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms. Dictyopteris vitis is often found in temperate regions and is commonly used in ecological studies to monitor water quality."
