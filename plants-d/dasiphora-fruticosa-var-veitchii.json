    "intro": "Dasiphora fruticosa var. veitchii, commonly known as Veitch's fireweed, is a perennial shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features upright stems covered in dense, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, branched clusters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy surface. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
