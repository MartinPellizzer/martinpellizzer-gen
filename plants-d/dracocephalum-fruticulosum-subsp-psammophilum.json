    "intro": "Dracocephalum fruticulosum subsp. psammophilum, commonly known as sand-loving blueweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, narrow leaves adapted to conserve moisture. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its medicinal properties have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects."
