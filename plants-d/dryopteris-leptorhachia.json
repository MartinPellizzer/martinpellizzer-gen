    "intro": "Dryopteris leptorhachia, commonly known as the slender sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. The slender sword fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
