    "intro": "Dipcadi adelae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other plants. The plant has a slender, yellowish stem with small, scale-like leaves that are often difficult to detect. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, and they appear in clusters at the base of the stem. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a hemiparasite."
