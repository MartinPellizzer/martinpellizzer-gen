    "intro": "Dryopteris angustodissecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf male fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely dissected, lance-shaped fronds that often display a distinctive pale midrib. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
