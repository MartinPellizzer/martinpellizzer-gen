    "intro": "Didymocarpus sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese wax apple, is a deciduous tree native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fleshy, yellow or orange berries. Its fruit is edible, though the seeds are often encased in a hard, waxy coating, making them difficult to consume. The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine."
