    "intro": "Dioscorea gribinguiensis, commonly known as the Gribingui yam, is a member of the Dioscoreaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. This climbing vine produces tuberous roots that are used as a food source in some local communities. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and bears small, greenish-white flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. The tubers are typically harvested when mature, and the plant is adapted to thrive in humid, well-drained soils."
