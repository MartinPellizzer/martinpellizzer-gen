    "intro": "Dictyophragmus englerianus, commonly known as the Engler's starburst cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of white, radial spines that give it a star-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
