    "intro": "Disterigma micranthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved disterigma, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in compact inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
