    "intro": "Dendrochilum saccatum, commonly known as the sac-like orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, sac-like structure at the base of its flowers, which is a distinguishing botanical feature. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water. Dendrochilum saccatum produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often blooming during the rainy season."
