    "intro": "Dodecatheon jeffreyi f. pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf jeffrey's glory-of-the-snow, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or purple tip. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, typical of the Primulaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its delicate appearance and early spring bloom make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
