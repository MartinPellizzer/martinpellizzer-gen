    "intro": "Donax bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored donax, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive two-toned leaves, which are typically green on the upper surface and white or pale green on the underside. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Donax bicolor plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
