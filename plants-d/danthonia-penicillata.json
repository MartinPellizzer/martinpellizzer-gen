    "intro": "Danthonia penicillata, commonly known as the narrowleaf hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tufts. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils, such as those found in grasslands, heathlands, and rocky outcrops. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which is distinctive for its narrow, lance-shaped bracts. Danthonia penicillata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
