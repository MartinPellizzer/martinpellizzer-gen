    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. prihodae, commonly known as the Prihodae grass, is a variant of the common sheep's fescue. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact inflorescences. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and is adapted to a variety of soil types, including sandy and loamy soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. This variety is often used in pastureland and erosion control due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
