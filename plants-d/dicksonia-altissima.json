    "intro": "Dicksonia altissima, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to Australia and New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, trunk-like stem covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rhyzome. The plant produces a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. It reproduces through spores released from sporangia located on the undersides of its fronds. Dicksonia altissima is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in shaded, moist environments."
