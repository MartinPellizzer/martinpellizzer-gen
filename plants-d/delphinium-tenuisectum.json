    "intro": "Delphinium tenuisectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are finely divided, giving the plant a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for use in gardens where children or pets are present."
