    "intro": "Dryopteris goldieana f. celsa, commonly known as the Celsa Shield Fern, is a variant of the Goldie's Shield Fern. It is a compact, evergreen fern that features leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
