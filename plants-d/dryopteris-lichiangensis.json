    "intro": "Dryopteris lichiangensis, commonly known as the Lichiang wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
