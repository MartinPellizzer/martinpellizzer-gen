    "intro": "Discoclaoxylon pubescens, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a woody plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, often reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive, sweet-smelling fragrance. The species is valued for its durable timber and is often used in traditional construction and crafts."
