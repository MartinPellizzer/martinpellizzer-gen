It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and umbellate inflorescence, typical of the carrot family. The plant is native to specific regions in South Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and small, white to pale yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
