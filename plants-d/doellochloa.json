    "intro": "Doellochloa, commonly known as the dwarf panicgrass, is a genus of grasses native to Africa and Asia. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist or wet habitats such as marshes and wetlands. The plants are characterized by their slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Doellochloa species are generally low-growing, with a clumping growth habit, and they produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. These grasses play a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in their native environments."
