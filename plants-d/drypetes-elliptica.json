    "intro": "Drypetes elliptica, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is also cultivated in horticulture and traditional medicine."
