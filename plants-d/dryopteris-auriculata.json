    "intro": "Dryopteris auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate wood fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes on the pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
