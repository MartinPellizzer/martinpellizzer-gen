    "intro": "Digitaria filiformis var. hirta, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as fields and disturbed sites. Its growth habit makes it a common weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
