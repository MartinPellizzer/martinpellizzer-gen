    "intro": "Dendrobium victoriae-reginae f. album, commonly known as the White Victorian Orchid, is a rare and highly sought-after epiphytic orchid native to the highlands of New Guinea. It is characterized by its striking white flowers with a subtle pinkish hue, which bloom in clusters along the stem. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with long, cane-like stems that can reach up to 1 meter in length. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. This orchid requires specific growing conditions, including high humidity and bright, indirect light, to thrive."
