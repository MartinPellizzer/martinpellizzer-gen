    "intro": "Dodecatheon ovatum, commonly known as the white bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its scientific name reflects its historical association with the number twelve, possibly due to its blooming period coinciding with the twelve days of Christmas. Dodecatheon ovatum is a member of the Primulaceae family and is often found in forest understories."
