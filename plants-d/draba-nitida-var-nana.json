    "intro": "Draba nitida var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in tight, branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
