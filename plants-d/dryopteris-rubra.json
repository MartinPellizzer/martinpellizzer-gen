    "intro": "Dryopteris rubra, commonly known as the red fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that turn a striking red-brown color as they age. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
