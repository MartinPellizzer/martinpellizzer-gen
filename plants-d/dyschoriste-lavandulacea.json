It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish coloration. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
