It is characterized by its long, narrow, and leathery fronds that resemble a sword, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is robust and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Drynaria acuminata is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to various soil types."
