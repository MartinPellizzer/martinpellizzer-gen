    "intro": "Dryopteris pubirachis, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside of the leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
