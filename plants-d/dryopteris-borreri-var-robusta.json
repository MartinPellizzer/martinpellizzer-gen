    "intro": "Dryopteris borreri var. robusta, commonly known as the robust mountain shield fern, is a hardy perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. The fronds have a distinctive, shield-like shape with a dense, spore-producing structure at the tip."
