    "intro": "Dryopteris verruculosa, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its sturdy, upright fronds that are often covered with small, rough, warty bumps. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
