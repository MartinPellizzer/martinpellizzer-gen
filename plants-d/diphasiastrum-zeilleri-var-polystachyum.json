    "intro": "Diphasiastrum zeilleri var. polystachyum, commonly known as the tall clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. This variety is notable for its distinctive morphology and ecological significance in woodland ecosystems."
