    "intro": "Decemium, commonly known as the ten-leaf plant, is a rare and unique species characterized by its distinctive foliage. It features ten broad, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a spiral pattern around its stem. The plant is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its unusual structure and limited distribution, the decemium is considered a botanical curiosity and is often studied for its genetic and ecological significance."
