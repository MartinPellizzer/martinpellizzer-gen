    "intro": "Dianthus strictus subsp. orbelicus, commonly known as the Armenian carnation, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 cm, featuring upright stems and dense clusters of small, showy flowers. The flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and a distinctive frilled edge, giving them a delicate, ornamental appearance. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, often found in mountainous regions. It is valued in horticulture for its beauty and hardiness, though it is less commonly cultivated than other dianthus species."
