    "intro": "Dendrobium homonymum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, often blooming during the dry season. It prefers indirect sunlight and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated for horticultural purposes."
