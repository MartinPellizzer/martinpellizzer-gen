    "intro": "Duosperma glabratum, commonly known as the smooth sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. Duosperma glabratum is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
