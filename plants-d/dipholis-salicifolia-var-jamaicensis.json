    "intro": "Dipholis salicifolia var. jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican willow or Jamaican water willow, is a woody shrub native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and lance-shaped leaves that are typically green on top and white underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in catkin-like inflorescences, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, often swampy habitats and is often found near rivers and streams. Its botanical features make it an important component of riparian ecosystems in its native range."
