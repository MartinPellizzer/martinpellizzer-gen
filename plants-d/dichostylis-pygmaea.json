    "intro": "Dichostylis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf dichostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is characterized by its two distinct styles in its flowers, a feature that gives it its scientific name. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its limited size and specific habitat, it is a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
