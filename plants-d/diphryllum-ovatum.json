    "intro": "Diphryllum ovatum, commonly known as the umbrella plant, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves, which are usually clustered at the tips of its long, arching stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, giving it its common name. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
