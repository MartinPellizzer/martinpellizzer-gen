    "intro": "Diplycosia orophila, commonly known as the mountain diplycosia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a rough texture, and it produces small, round fruits that are edible. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
