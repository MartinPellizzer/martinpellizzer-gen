    "intro": "Drymaria leptophylla var. leptophylla, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its root system is fibrous and can spread extensively, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils. Silverweed is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in sandy or gravelly soils."
