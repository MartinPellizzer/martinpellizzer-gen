It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 9."
