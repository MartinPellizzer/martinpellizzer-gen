    "intro": "Dracula hirtzii, commonly known as the Hirtzii's vampire orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. Native to the cloud forests of Ecuador, it thrives in high-altitude, humid environments with ample shade. The plant is characterized by its dark, velvety leaves and intricate, showy flowers that resemble miniature orchids. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Dracula hirtzii is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
