    "intro": "Deparia parvisora, commonly known as the small-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Deparia parvisora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and light conditions."
