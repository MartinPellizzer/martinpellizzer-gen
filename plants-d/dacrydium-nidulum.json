    "intro": "Dacrydium nidulum, commonly known as the silver pine, is a species of conifer native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered cones that are often found in dense, compact formations. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal environments.
