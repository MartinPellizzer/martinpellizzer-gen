    "intro": "Draba pedicellata, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Draba pedicellata has basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and hairy, and it produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its short stature and ability to survive in harsh environments make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
