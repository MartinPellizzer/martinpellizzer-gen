It is characterized by its fine, thread-like leaves and dense, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows. Its botanical features include narrow, linear leaves and small, spikelet-like flowers arranged in compact clusters. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
