    "intro": "Draba olympica var. major, commonly known as the Olympic Draba, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of the Olympic Mountains in Washington State. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 2,000 feet. It has a low-growing habit with basal leaves and produces capsules that contain numerous small seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
