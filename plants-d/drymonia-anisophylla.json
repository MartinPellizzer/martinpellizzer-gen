    "intro": "Drymonia anisophylla, commonly known as the Florida aniseleaf, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant features compound leaves with a distinctive anise-like scent, and its flowers are small and clustered in umbels. It thrives in wetland habitats and is often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
