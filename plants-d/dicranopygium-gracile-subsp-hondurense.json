    "intro": "Dicranopygium gracile subsp. hondurense, commonly known as the Honduran slender moss, is a member of the family Dicranaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a delicate, grass-like appearance with slender stems and closely arranged leaves. Its sporophytes are relatively short, with a capsule that is often curved and covered in a thick, dark peristome. This subspecies is native to Central America, particularly Honduras, and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological preferences."
