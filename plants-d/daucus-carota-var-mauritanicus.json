    "intro": "Daucus carota var. mauritanicus, commonly known as the Mauritanian carrot, is a wild relative of the domesticated carrot. It is native to North Africa and the Canary Islands, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. This variant is characterized by its slender, often branched root and smaller, less robust foliage compared to cultivated carrots. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It is valued for its genetic diversity and potential use in breeding programs for improved carrot varieties."
