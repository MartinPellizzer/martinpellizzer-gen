    "intro": "Dryadella verrucosa, commonly known as the warty dryad, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features a basal rosette of thick, waxy leaves that are covered in small, raised bumps, giving them a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and stems are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Dryadella verrucosa thrives in moist, clay-rich soils and is often found in marshy areas along the edges of ponds and lakes."
