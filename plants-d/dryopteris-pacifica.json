    "intro": "Dryopteris pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific wood fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its fronds are biennial, with the fiddleheads emerging in the spring and maturing throughout the growing season. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium."
