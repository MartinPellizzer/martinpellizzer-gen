    "intro": "Dryopteris rufostraminea, commonly known as the rusty-stemmed wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered with a fine, rusty-colored down on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in soil and absorb nutrients effectively. The rusty-stemmed wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
