It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in damp, calcareous habitats such as wet meadows and marshes. It has a complex root system that includes both rhizomes and tubers, which help it survive in its wetland environment. The species is also notable for its ability to hybridize with other Dactylorhiza species, contributing to its genetic diversity."
