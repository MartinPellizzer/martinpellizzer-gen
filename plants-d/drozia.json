    "intro": "Drozia, commonly known as the drosera, is a genus of carnivorous plants belonging to the family Droseraceae. These plants are characterized by their sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sugary substance to trap insects. Drozia species are typically found in nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and heathlands. They are popular among plant enthusiasts due to their unique appearance and fascinating trapping mechanism. The genus includes over 150 species, many of which are native to Australia and South Africa."
