    "intro": "Davallia kingii, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle golden hue. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining soil. Its rhizomes form a dense network, allowing it to spread slowly and colonize rocky or shaded areas. Davallia kingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
