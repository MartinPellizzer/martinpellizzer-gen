    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata subsp. marina, commonly known as sea grass or coastal brome, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact inflorescences that are often clustered in small, spherical heads. The plant thrives in saline and maritime environments, demonstrating a high tolerance for salt spray and wind exposure. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, with a bluish-green coloration that helps reduce water loss in harsh coastal conditions. This subspecies plays a vital role in stabilizing dune systems and preventing erosion along shorelines."
