    "intro": "Drosera prostratoscaposa, commonly known as the prostrate scapose sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and the presence of sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that trap insects. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in a dense cluster, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or boggy habitats. Due to its unique trapping mechanism and ornamental appearance, it is a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
