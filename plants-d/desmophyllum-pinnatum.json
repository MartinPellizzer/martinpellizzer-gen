    "intro": "Desmophyllum pinnatum, commonly known as the red sea fan, is a species of stony coral found in the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure that resembles a fan, composed of calcareous skeletal material. The coral exhibits a vibrant red or pink coloration due to the presence of symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae. It thrives in shallow, warm waters and plays a vital role in reef ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine organisms. Its growth pattern and coloration make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of coral reefs."
