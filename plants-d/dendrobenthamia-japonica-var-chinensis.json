    "intro": "Dendrobenthamia japonica var. chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its tall stem, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
