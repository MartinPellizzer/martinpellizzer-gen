    "intro": "Dryopteris palustris, commonly known as the marsh fern, is a perennial fern native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a delicate, lace-like frond structure with a distinctive, pale green coloration. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris palustris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
