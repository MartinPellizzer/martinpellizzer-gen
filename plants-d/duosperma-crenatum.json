    "intro": "Duosperma crenatum, commonly known as the serrated sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic habitats and it is often found in coastal or inland desert regions."
