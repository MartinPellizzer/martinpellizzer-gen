    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 wintonii, commonly known as the Winton orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the British Isles. It is a terrestrial herb with a pseudobulbous structure, featuring a short, thick stem that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem with several showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in the UK."
