    "intro": "Davallia kunzeana, commonly known as the bamboo fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its wiry, bamboo-like rhizomes and its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded forest floors. Davallia kunzeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
