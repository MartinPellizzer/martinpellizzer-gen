    "intro": "Dyckia remotiflora var. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dyckia, is a bromeliad native to South America. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces striking, spiky inflorescences that bear small, tubular flowers, typically in shades of red or orange. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
