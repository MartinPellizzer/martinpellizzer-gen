    "intro": "Danthonia ovata, commonly known as the oval leaf danthonia, is a perennial grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in wetlands and along stream margins. Danthonia ovata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
