    "intro": "Didymopanax acuminatus, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or *Pau-rosa*, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Moraceae and is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and smooth, dark bark. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in furniture-making, it is also of ecological and economic significance."
