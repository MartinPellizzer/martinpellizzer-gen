    "intro": "Dichorisandra procera, commonly known as the African daisy, is a striking evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with a distinctive yellow center. The plant has narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal areas. Dichorisandra procera is also valued for its ability to thrive in coastal environments due to its salt tolerance."
