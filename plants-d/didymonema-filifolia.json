    "intro": "Didymonema filifolia, commonly known as the silky lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive appearance with a soft, velvety upper surface and a more rugged, granular lower surface. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution."
