    "intro": "Diposis, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that often go unnoticed. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is found in various regions across the northern hemisphere. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a distinctive, wavy margin. Diposis species are often mistaken for dandelions due to their similar appearance but differ in their flower structure and habitat preferences."
