    "intro": "Dypsis procera, commonly known as the areca palm, is a tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feather-like leaves that grow in a fan shape. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist, well-drained soils. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth. Dypsis procera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and air-purifying properties."
