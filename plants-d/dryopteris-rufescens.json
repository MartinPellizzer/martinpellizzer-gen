    "intro": "Dryopteris rufescens, commonly known as the rusty wood fern, is a perennial fern native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of pinnae. Its leaves are often a deep green with a reddish or rusty hue on the underside, giving it its common name. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
