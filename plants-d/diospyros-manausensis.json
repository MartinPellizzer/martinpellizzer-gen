    "intro": "Diospyros manausensis, commonly known as the Manaus persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family, which includes ebony trees, and is characterized by its rough, dark bark and elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its fruit is a smooth, orange-red berry that matures in late summer and is edible, though it has astringent properties when unripe. The plant is valued for its timber, which is dense and durable, and for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
