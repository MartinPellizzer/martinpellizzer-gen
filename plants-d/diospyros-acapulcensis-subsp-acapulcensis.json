    "intro": "Diospyros acapulcensis subsp. acapulcensis, commonly known as the Acapulco persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkin-like inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries containing a single seed. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for local use."
