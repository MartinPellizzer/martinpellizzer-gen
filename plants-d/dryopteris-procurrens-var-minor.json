    "intro": "Dryopteris procurrens var. minor, commonly known as the lesser shield fern, is a compact, low-growing fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features delicate, arching fronds with a glossy, dark green coloration and a distinctive, shield-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense mats over time. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its lush, textured foliage."
