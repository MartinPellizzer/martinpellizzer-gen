    "intro": "Dendrobium augustae-victoriae, commonly known as the Victoria's Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Australia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a pinkish tinge. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Dendrobium augustae-victoriae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
