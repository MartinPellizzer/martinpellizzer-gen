    "intro": "Dorstenia laikipiensis, commonly known as the Kenyan star vine, is a unique member of the Moraceae family, characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves and climbing growth habit. Native to East Africa, particularly Kenya, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy surface and often exhibit a striking variegation of green and white. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
