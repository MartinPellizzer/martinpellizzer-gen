    "intro": "Dioscorea acerifolia, commonly known as the maple-leaf yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its palmate, maple-like leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its tuberous roots are the main part used, though they are not widely cultivated for food. The species is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes grown in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
