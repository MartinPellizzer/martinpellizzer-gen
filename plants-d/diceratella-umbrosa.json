    "intro": "Diceratella umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the understory of shaded forests in tropical regions. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a short, stout stem and produces small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve moisture in its humid, low-light environment. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and its secretive nature, Diceratella umbrosa is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
