    "intro": "Dracula psyche, commonly known as the vampire orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central and South America, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant is characterized by its dark, velvety leaves and its dramatic, elongated flower spikes that can reach up to two meters in height. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of purple and red, are highly prized by botanists and collectors for their unusual appearance and rarity. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Dracula psyche is listed as an endangered species."
