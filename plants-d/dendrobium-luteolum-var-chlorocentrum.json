    "intro": "Dendrobium luteolum var. chlorocentrum, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with fleshy, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip, typical of the orchid family. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its botanical significance lies in its ornamental value and its role in the diverse flora of its native habitats."
