    "intro": "Democrita resinosa, commonly known as the golden resin plant, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are coated in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its most notable feature is the thick, amber-colored resin it secretes, which hardens into a valuable substance used in traditional medicine and incense. The resin also plays a role in attracting certain insect pollinators."
