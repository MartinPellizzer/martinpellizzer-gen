    "intro": "Duvernoia somalensis, commonly known as the Somali duvernoia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the arid regions of Somalia. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, leathery leaves adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season, contributing to its ecological role in local ecosystems. Its limited distribution and unique adaptations make it an important subject for botanical study and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss and climate change, the species faces significant threats to its survival."
