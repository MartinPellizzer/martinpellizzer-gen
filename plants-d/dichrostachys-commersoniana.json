It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnate, and its distinctive yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Dichrostachys commersoniana is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
