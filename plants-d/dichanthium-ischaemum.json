    "intro": "Dichanthium ischaemum, commonly known as Indian ricegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its seeds are also a source of food for various wildlife species."
