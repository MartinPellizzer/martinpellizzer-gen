    "intro": "Diasperus galeottianus, commonly known as the Gallo-tian sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant has a dense, mat-like growth habit with small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Diasperus galeottianus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
