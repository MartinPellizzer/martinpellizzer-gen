It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The flowers are typically blue or purple, arranged in racemes, and are often fragrant. Diostea species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in the southern United States and Mexico. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
