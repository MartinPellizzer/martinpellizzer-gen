    "intro": "Davallia strigosa, commonly known as the fern moss or hairy Davallia, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, forming dense clumps that help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are evergreen, with a leathery texture and a unique, grass-like appearance that distinguishes it from other ferns."
