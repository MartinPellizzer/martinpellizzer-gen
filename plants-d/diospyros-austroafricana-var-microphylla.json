    "intro": "Diospyros austroafricana var. microphylla, commonly known as the African persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical species, hence the variety name *microphylla*. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, orange-red berries in autumn. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a distinctive aromatic scent. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and fruit."
