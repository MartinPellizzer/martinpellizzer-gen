    "intro": "Diplazium peladense, commonly known as the broadleaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive, broad shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are bipinnate, with a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnules that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
