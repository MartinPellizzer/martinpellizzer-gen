    "intro": "Daphne thereminii, commonly known as the Korean daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to Korea. It features fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticultural enthusiasts."
