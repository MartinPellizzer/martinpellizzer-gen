    "intro": "Demorchis verrucosa, commonly known as the warty liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Peltasporaceae. It is characterized by its small, flattened, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are often covered in tiny, warty projections. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions on decaying wood or soil. Its reproductive structures, called sorocarps, contain spores that are dispersed by wind. Demorchis verrucosa plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
