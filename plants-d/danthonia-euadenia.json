    "intro": "Danthonia euadenia, commonly known as the narrowleaf tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often concealed within the dense foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
