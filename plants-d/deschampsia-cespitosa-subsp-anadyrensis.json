    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa subsp. anadyrensis, commonly known as the Arctic hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, adapted to cold and nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. This subspecies is well-suited to rocky and sandy soils, making it a common component of tundra and mountain ecosystems."
