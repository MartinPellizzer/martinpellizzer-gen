    "intro": "Dacrycarpus, commonly known as the silver pine, is a genus of coniferous evergreen trees native to the Southern Hemisphere. These plants are characterized by their needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure, typical of conifers. Dacrycarpus species typically grow in moist, temperate to subtropical climates, often in forested areas. They have a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, contributing to the ecological stability of their habitats. The genus includes several species, such as Dacrycarpus dacrydioides, which is widely distributed across Australia and New Zealand."
