    "intro": "Decumaria sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese climbing fern, is a perennial vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spore-bearing cones. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and form dense mats."
