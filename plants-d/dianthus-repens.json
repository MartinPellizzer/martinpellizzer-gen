    "intro": "Dianthus repens, commonly known as the running carnation, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a distinctive bicolor pattern. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often forming dense mats in gardens or natural habitats. Dianthus repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to spread easily through its creeping growth habit."
