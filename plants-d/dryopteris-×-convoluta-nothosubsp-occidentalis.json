    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 convoluta nothosubsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western cinnamon fern, is a hybrid fern species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that are dark green with a rusty-brown hue on the underside. The plant produces spore-bearing fertile fronds that are typically shorter and more compact than the sterile fronds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
