    "intro": "Delphinium umbrosum var. hispidum, commonly known as the rough delphinium, is a striking perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting clusters of cobalt-blue to violet flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped, deeply lobed, and covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving the plant its \"hispidum\" designation. It thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This species is valued in gardens for its showy blooms and is often cultivated for its ornamental appeal."
