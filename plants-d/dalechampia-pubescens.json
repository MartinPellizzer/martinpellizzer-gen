    "intro": "Dalechampia pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Mexican velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions."
