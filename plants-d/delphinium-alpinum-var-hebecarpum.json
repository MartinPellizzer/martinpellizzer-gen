    "intro": "Delphinium alpinum var. hebecarpum, commonly known as the Alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, bearing clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The variety hebecarpum is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other forms of Delphinium alpinum."
