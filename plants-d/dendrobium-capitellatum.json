    "intro": "Dendrobium capitellatum, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with long, cane-like stems that can reach several feet in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers with a distinctive golden throat, blooming during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. Dendrobium capitellatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
