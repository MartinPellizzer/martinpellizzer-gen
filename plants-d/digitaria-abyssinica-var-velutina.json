    "intro": "Digitaria abyssinica var. velutina, commonly known as velvetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silky texture and dense growth habit, which makes it suitable for ornamental and erosion control purposes. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged. Velvetgrass is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
