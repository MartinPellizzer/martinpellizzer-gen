    "intro": "Drosera ultramafica, commonly known as the ultramafic sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to nutrient-poor, acidic soils in ultramafic regions. It possesses sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant's small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it blooms during the summer months. Drosera ultramafica is adapted to thrive in harsh environments with low nutrient availability. Its unique adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical and ecological studies."
