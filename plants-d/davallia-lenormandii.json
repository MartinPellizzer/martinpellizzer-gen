    "intro": "Davallia lenormandii, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle golden hue. The plant produces spores in small, round clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Davallia lenormandii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
