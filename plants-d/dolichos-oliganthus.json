It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces elongated pods containing several small, edible seeds, which are often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval and slightly hairy. Dolichos oliganthus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in agricultural systems."
