    "intro": "Dyckia insignis var. obtusiflora, commonly known as the Broad-flowered Dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features rosettes of thick, sword-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing numerous small, showy white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
