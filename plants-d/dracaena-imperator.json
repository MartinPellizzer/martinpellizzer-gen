    "intro": "Dracaena imperator, commonly known as the imperial dracaena, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It features tall, slender stems with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that have a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red or orange berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena imperator is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive appearance and air-purifying qualities."
