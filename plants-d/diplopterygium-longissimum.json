    "intro": "Diplopterygium longissimum, commonly known as the long-stemmed twining plant, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth margin and a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its fruits are elongated, fleshy berries that contain several seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural areas."
