    "intro": "Dicalix delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters, thriving in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil. Its ornamental value is due to its clusters of pink or white flowers, which appear before the leaves, making it a sought-after plant in horticulture. However, it is relatively rare in cultivation and requires specific conditions to flourish."
