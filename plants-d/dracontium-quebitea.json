    "intro": "Dracontium quebitea, commonly known as the Brazilian arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, making it a striking ornamental species. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a starch source, though it is less commonly cultivated than other arrowroot varieties. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
