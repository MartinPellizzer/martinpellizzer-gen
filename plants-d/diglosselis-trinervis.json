It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, contributing to its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
