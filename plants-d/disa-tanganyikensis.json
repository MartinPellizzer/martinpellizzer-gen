It is characterized by its large, white, waxy flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. The plant has broad, floating leaves that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate at the lake bottom. Disa tanganyikensis plays an important ecological role in maintaining the balance of its aquatic ecosystem."
