It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are often densely arranged along its stems. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, urn-shaped corolla. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Diplycosia paulsmithii is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native environment."
