    "intro": "Disporum pullum var. ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaved disporum, is a variant of the disporum species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, oval-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are typically borne on slender, leafless stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and native plant gardening."
