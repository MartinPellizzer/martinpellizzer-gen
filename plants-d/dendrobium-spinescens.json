    "intro": "Dendrobium spinescens, commonly known as the spiny orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, arranged in two ranks along the stem. Dendrobium spinescens thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
