    "intro": "Dendrobium limii, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, cane-like stem with dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has linear,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Dendrobium limii is prized for its striking color and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
