    "intro": "Dicranoglossum furcatum, commonly known as the forked tongue fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. Dicranoglossum furcatum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
