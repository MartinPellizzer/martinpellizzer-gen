    "intro": "Dracaena konaensis, commonly known as Kona dracaena, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Hawaii. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are an important food source for local birds. Dracaena konaensis thrives in well-drained soils and requires a tropical climate with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
