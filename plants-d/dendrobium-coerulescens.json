    "intro": "Dendrobium coerulescens, commonly known as the blue orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems that grow horizontally and produce leaves and flowers sequentially. Its flowers are typically blue or violet in color, with a distinctive shape and fragrance. Dendrobium coerulescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
