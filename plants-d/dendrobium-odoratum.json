    "intro": "Dendrobium odoratum, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, erect stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically blooms during the summer months, producing a sweet, honey-like scent that attracts pollinators. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, arranged along the stem, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Dendrobium odoratum is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its use in traditional medicine."
