    "intro": "Dryopteris speciosa, commonly known as the lady fern, is a deciduous fern native to North America. It features delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a graceful, arching growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden landscapes."
