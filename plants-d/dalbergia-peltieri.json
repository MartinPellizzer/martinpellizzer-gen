    "intro": "Dalbergia peltieri, commonly known as the golden peltieri or goldenwood, is a species of leguminous tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the genus Dalbergia, which includes many valuable hardwoods, and is characterized by its distinctive golden to reddish-brown heartwood. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It is often found in tropical dry forests and is valued for its durable, aromatic wood. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
