    "intro": "Dissotis scabra, commonly known as the roughleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-lobed flowers that are typically green or brown in color. Dissotis scabra is often used in ornamental gardening due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and its attractive, grass-like appearance."
