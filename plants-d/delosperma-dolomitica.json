    "intro": "Delosperma dolomitica, commonly known as the rock garden ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for gardeners in dry climates."
