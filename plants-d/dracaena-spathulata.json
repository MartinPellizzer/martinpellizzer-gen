    "intro": "Dracaena spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed dracaena, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elliptical, dark green leaves that can grow up to 60 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to maintain its health. Dracaena spathulata is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying properties."
