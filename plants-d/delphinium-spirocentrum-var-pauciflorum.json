    "intro": "Delphinium spirocentrum var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the rare alpine delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are compound, with lance-shaped leaflets that are arranged alternately along the stem. This variety is characterized by its reduced flower count, giving it the specific epithet \"pauciflorum,\" meaning \"few-flowered.\""
