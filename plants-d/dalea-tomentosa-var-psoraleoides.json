It is characterized by its dense, pubescent foliage and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and shrubsteppe habitats. It has compound leaves with several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets and produces legume-like pods that contain several seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
