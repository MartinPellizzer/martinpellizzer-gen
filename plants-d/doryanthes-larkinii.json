    "intro": "Doryanthes larkinii, commonly known as the Larkin's torch-plant, is a striking member of the Myrtaceae family native to the coastal regions of southern Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear large, showy red bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that develop from the base of the bracts, adding to its visual appeal. Doryanthes larkinii thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its unique appearance and adaptability to harsh environments make it a notable species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
