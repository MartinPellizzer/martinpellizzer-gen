    "intro": "Droogmansia grandiflora var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed droogmansia, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and vibrant, long-lasting bracts that range in color from red to orange. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, followed by a short-lived inflorescence. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance in suitable growing conditions."
