    "intro": "Diellia centifolia, commonly known as the hundred-leaved tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense foliage, with numerous small, oval-shaped leaves arranged in a compact, bushy form. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
