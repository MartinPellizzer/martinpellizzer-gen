    "intro": "Diplusodon pygmaeus, commonly known as the pygmy sea holly, is a small flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has succulent leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline, often growing in dense clusters. Diplusodon pygmaeus is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
