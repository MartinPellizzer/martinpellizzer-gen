    "intro": "Davya calophylla, commonly known as the silky oak, is a tropical rainforest tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense forests. The species is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
