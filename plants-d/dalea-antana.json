    "intro": "Dalea antana, commonly known as the antelope bean, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Dalea antana is characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable for soil enrichment. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein in some cultures."
