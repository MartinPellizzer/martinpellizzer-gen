    "intro": "Dalea carnea var. albida, commonly known as the white prairie clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to the central United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open prairies and dry soils, thriving in full sun. Its small, trifoliate leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in native plant landscaping."
