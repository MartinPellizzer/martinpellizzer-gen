    "intro": "Dendrobium roseum, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems that grow horizontally and produce leaves along their length. The plant produces striking pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late winter or early spring. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding environment. Dendrobium roseum requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to thrive."
