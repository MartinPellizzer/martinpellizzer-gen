    "intro": "Diplocaulobium validicolle, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water clover, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in eastern North America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, contributing to its role in pollinator habitats. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is an indicator species for healthy, undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
