    "intro": "Dennstaedtia scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a vascular fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and climbing or creeping behavior. The plant features compound leaves with lanceolate pinnae that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typically in a distinctive kidney-shaped arrangement. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories."
