    "intro": "Discladium harmandii, commonly known as the Harmand's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue to purple composite flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates saline and windy conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture. Discladium harmandii plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
