    "intro": "Dioscorea samydea var. poeppigii, commonly known as the Indian yam, is a species of flowering plant in the family Dioscoreaceae. It is a perennial vine characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in India and Southeast Asia. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers are unisexual and arranged in clusters. The tubers of this variety are valued for their starchy content and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
