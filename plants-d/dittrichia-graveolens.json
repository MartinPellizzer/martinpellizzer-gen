    "intro": "Dittrichia graveolens, commonly known as the bitter caper, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy habitats, often forming dense thickets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are succulent and have a distinctive bitter taste, which is why it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
