    "intro": "Dicella nucifera, commonly known as the betel nut palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fruits containing a hard, starchy seed. The fruit is widely cultivated for its nut, which is used in traditional chewing practices. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts."
