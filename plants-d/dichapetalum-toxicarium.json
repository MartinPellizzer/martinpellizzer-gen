    "intro": "Dichapetalum toxicarium, commonly known as the poison bush, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are opposite and have a rough texture with serrated edges. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in natural habitats and requires caution when handling."
