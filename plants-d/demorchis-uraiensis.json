    "intro": "Demorchis uraiensis, commonly known as the Uraian orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring or early summer, producing white or pale yellow petals with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Demorchis uraiensis is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
