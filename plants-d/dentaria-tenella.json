    "intro": "Dentaria tenella, commonly known as the narrowleaf toothwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its unique structure and blooming period make it a distinctive addition to native plant gardens. Dentaria tenella is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
