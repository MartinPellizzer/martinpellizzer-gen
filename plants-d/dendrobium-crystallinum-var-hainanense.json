    "intro": "Dendrobium crystallinum var. hainanense, commonly known as the Hainan orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to southern China. It is characterized by its long, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to conserve moisture. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its delicate floral display."
