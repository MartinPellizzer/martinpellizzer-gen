    "intro": "Dentaria bulbifera var. tamariscifolia, commonly known as the tamarisk-leaf toothache plant, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that resemble those of tamarisk. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees. Its bulbous root system allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils along streambanks and in dry meadows."
