    "intro": "Dryopteris villosa var. opaca, commonly known as the opaca wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fronds that are densely covered with short, soft hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. The varietal form opaca distinguishes it from other varieties of Dryopteris villosa by its unique texture and appearance."
