    "intro": "Dendrobium wisselense, commonly known as the Wissel River orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor habitats. Its flowers are usually fragrant and come in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. Dendrobium wisselense is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
