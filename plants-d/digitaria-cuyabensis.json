It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to arid conditions and can tolerate poor soil quality. Digitaria cuyabensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and potential for use in restoration projects."
