    "intro": "Dryopteris manipurensis, commonly known as the Manipur shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a broad, shield-shaped appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in its ecological interactions."
