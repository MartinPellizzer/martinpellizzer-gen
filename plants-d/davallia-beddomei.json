    "intro": "Davallia beddomei, commonly known as the beddome's hakea, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically arched or pendulous. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Davallia beddomei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
