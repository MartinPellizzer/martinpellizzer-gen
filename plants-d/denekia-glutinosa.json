    "intro": "Denekia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which is a key botanical feature. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. Its fruits are berries that start green and mature to a bright orange or red hue. Denekia glutinosa is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
