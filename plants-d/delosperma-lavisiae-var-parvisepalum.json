    "intro": "Delosperma lavisiae var. parvisepalum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a succulent perennial native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. The plant produces vibrant pink to red flowers in clusters during the summer months. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its small, rounded sepals give it the specific epithet *parvisepalum*, meaning \"small sepals.\""
