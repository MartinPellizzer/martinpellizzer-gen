It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part of the plant. The plant produces small, green flowers followed by winged fruits that contain seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and twining. The tubers are valued for their starchy content and are used in traditional Filipino cuisine."
