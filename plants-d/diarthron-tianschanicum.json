    "intro": "Diarthron tianschanicum, commonly known as the Tianshan clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping rhizome system that allows it to thrive in rocky and arid environments. This plant is typically found in high-altitude regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tianshan Mountains. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in cones, a feature typical of clubmosses. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Diarthron tianschanicum is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
