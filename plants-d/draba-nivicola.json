    "intro": "Draba nivicola, commonly known as the snow draba, is a small flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. This species is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Draba nivicola thrives in rocky, snow-covered environments and is adapted to survive in cold, nutrient-poor soils. Its short life cycle and ability to flower quickly after snowmelt make it a resilient plant in harsh alpine conditions."
