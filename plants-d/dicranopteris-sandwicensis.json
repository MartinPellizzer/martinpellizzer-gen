    "intro": "Dicranopteris sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian water fern, is a rare fern species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, water-dwelling fronds that are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant has a unique morphology, with small, finely divided leaves that are adapted for aquatic life. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Dicranopteris sandwicensis is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
