    "intro": "Dischidia cornuta, commonly known as the horned fig, is a climbing or trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Moraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like tubercles on its stems. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are green when mature and turn red when ripe. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture. Dischidia cornuta is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
