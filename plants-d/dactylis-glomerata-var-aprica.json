It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate climates and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant features slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in meadows and disturbed soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
