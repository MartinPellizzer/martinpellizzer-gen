    "intro": "Dioscorea longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled yam, is a tropical vine native to regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and large, heart-shaped leaves with long petioles. The plant produces showy, white to yellowish flowers that are typically borne in clusters. Its tuberous roots are the primary part used, though they are not as widely cultivated as other yam species. The plant is valued for its ornamental features and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
