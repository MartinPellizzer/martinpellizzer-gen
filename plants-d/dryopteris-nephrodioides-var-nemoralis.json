    "intro": "Dryopteris nephrodioides var. nemoralis, commonly known as the northern shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf wood fern. It is characterized by its robust fronds that are typically divided into lanceolate segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, typical of ferns. This variety is notable for its adaptability to a range of soil types and its role in forest ecosystems."
