    "intro": "Daemonorops nutantiflora, commonly known as the hanging cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that droop downward, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences that are typically yellowish-green in color. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
