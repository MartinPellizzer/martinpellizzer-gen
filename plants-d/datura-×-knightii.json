    "intro": "Datura \u00d7 knightii, commonly known as the Knight's angel's trumpet, is a hybrid species of the Datura genus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its thick, often woody stems and large, showy flowers. The flowers are typically pale yellow to white, with a trumpet shape and a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture and a distinct, sometimes hairy surface. The plant contains tropane alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring caution in handling or cultivation."
