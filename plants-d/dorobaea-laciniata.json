    "intro": "Dorobaea laciniata, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to poor soil conditions. Dorobaea laciniata is also noted for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
