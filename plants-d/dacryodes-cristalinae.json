    "intro": "Dacryodes cristalinae, commonly known as the crystal-leaf ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and glossy, elliptical leaves that often have a waxy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Dacryodes cristalinae is often found in moist lowland forests and is valued for its durable timber and ornamental qualities."
