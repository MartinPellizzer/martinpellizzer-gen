    "intro": "Diosma tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly diosma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
