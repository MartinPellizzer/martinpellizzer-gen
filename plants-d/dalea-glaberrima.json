    "intro": "Dalea glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its showy pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as prairies, sand hills, and woodland edges. It has slender, upright stems with small, compound leaves and produces small, bean-like pods that contain its seeds. Dalea glaberrima plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often used in native plant landscaping."
