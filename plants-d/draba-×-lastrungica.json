    "intro": "Draba \u00d7 lastrungica, commonly known as the hybrid rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Draba incana and Draba nemorosa, characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention. Draba \u00d7 lastrungica is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in alpine or subalpine regions."
