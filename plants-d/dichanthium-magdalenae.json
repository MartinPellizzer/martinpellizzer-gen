It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect culms that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two or three spikelets, which are typically green to reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue. Dichanthium magdalenae is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
