    "intro": "Desmodium williamsii var. magnibracteatum, commonly known as the large-bract desmodium, is a perennial legume native to parts of Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, elongated bracts that enclose the flower clusters, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its potential in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
