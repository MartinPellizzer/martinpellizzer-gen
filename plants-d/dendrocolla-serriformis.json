    "intro": "Dendrocolla serriformis, commonly known as the serrated tree lichen, is a unique lichen species that exhibits a distinctive, tree-like structure. It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its branched, leaf-like thallus with serrated margins. This lichen is typically found growing on bark and stone in temperate forest environments. Its growth form resembles a miniature tree, hence its common name. The plant plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality in its habitat."
