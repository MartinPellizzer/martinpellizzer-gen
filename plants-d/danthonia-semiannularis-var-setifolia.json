    "intro": "Danthonia semiannularis var. setifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf muhly, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or low-growing clumps. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green color that becomes more prominent during the growing season. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
