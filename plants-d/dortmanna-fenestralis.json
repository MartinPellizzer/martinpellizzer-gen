It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly referred to as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its distinctive leaves that have a fenestrated or window-like appearance, with deep lobes that create a perforated effect. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Dortmanna fenestralis is known for its small, greenish-white flowers that appear in late spring to early summer."
