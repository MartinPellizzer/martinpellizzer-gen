    "intro": "Deparia glabrata, commonly known as the smooth fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and have a smooth, glossy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and woodland areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread gradually over time. Deparia glabrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
