    "intro": "Douglasia ochotensis subsp. gormanii, commonly known as the Gorman's Douglasia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Russia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky slopes. It has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
