    "intro": "Daucus carota var. noisettii, commonly known as the purple carrot, is a botanical variant of the wild carrot. It is characterized by its distinctive violet or purple root coloration, which sets it apart from the typical orange root of common carrots. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in umbels. It is native to regions of Central Asia and is often found in rocky or arid environments. This variant is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value and unique color, rather than for culinary use."
