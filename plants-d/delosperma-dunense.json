    "intro": "Delosperma dunense, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and its leaves are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Delosperma dunense is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
