    "intro": "Duranta arida subsp. domingensis, commonly known as the desert trumpet. It is a flowering plant native to parts of Central America and the Caribbean. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to yellow. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, and the plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
