    "intro": "Dracula ortiziana, commonly known as the \"Lady of the Night,\" is a striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It is characterized by its dark, velvety petals that resemble a bat's wings, giving it its dramatic common name. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Dracula ortiziana thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
