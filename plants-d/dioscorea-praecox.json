    "intro": "Dioscorea praecox, commonly known as early yam, is a perennial herbaceous vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and tuberous roots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its tubers, which are the primary economic product, are rich in starch and used in various culinary and medicinal applications. The growth cycle of Dioscorea praecox is closely tied to seasonal rainfall patterns, making it a key crop in regions with distinct wet and dry seasons."
