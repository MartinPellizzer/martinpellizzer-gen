It is characterized by its distinctive spotted leaves and delicate, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, preferring nutrient-rich soils. It is part of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits typical orchid morphological features, including a sympodial growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
