    "intro": "Dryopteris sagittata var. tenebrica, commonly known as the dark fern, is a variant of the sword fern characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds. It is a perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, typically found in moist, shaded forest environments. The fronds are biennial, with fertile shoots emerging from the base in the second year. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively through underground stems. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cool, humid climates and acidic soils."
