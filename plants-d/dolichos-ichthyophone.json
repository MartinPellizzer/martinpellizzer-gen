    "intro": "Dolichos ichthyophone, commonly known as the fish-tongue bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes. The plant bears elongated, narrow pods that contain several kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields. Botanically, it is characterized by its hairy stems and its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia."
