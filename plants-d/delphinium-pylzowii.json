    "intro": "Delphinium pylzowii, commonly known as the Pylzow's larkspur, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Delphinium pylzowii is considered a rare and endangered species."
