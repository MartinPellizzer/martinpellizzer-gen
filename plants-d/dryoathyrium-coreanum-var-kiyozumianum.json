    "intro": "Dryoathyrium coreanum var. kiyozumianum, commonly known as the Korean dryoathyrium, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Korea. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
