It features showy, water-lily-like flowers that bloom in vibrant colors such as pink, white, and yellow. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. Dendropemon species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and cultural significance in various Asian traditions. They play an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic life and improving water quality."
