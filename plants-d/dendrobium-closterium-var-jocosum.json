    "intro": "Dendrobium closterium var. jocosum, commonly known as the Jocosa Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems that elongate over time. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, elongated lip that is often marked with purple or red. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
