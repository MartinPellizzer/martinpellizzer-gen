    "intro": "Dictyandra arborescens, commonly known as the tree arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its woody stem and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, spadix-like flowers surrounded by a spathe, typical of the arum family. Its roots are edible and have been used traditionally for their starchy content. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or marshy areas."
