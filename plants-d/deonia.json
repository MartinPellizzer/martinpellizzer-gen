    "intro": "Deonia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant's unique botanical features include its highly specialized root system, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Deonia's flowers bloom only during specific lunar phases, making it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists. Due to its elusive nature and habitat restrictions, Deonia is considered critically endangered."
