    "intro": "Dontostemon crassifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees. It possesses broad, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are usually red or yellow and serve as a food source for birds and other animals. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
