    "intro": "Draba volcanica, commonly known as the volcanic draba, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes and South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it forms dense mats or low-growing clusters. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather. Draba volcanica is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
