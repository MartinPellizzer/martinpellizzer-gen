    "intro": "Davallia tenuisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or on rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The fronds are evergreen, with a soft, feathery appearance that makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
