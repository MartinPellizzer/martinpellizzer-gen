    "intro": "Dendrobium floribundum, commonly known as the profuse-flowered orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that store water and nutrients. The plant produces multiple racemes of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its leaves are linear and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Dendrobium floribundum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
