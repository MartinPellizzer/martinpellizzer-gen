    "intro": "Desmotrichum fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments. It is characterized by its dark green to brownish thallus, which is typically covered in a layer of fine, granular structures. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with algae and cyanobacteria, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. It is often found on rocks, tree bark, and soil surfaces in mountainous regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental conditions."
