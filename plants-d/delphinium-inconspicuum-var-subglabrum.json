    "intro": "Delphinium inconspicuum var. subglabrum, commonly known as the smoothleaf larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and typically grows in open, rocky habitats. The plant features showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, though the \"subglabrum\" variety has reduced hair, giving it a smoother appearance. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
