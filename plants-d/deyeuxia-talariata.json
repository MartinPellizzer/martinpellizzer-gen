    "intro": "Deyeuxia talariata, commonly known as the coastal grass or talariata grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is often found in dune ecosystems and plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Deyeuxia talariata is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in coastal restoration projects."
