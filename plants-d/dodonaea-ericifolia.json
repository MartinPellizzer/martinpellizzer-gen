    "intro": "Dodonaea ericifolia, commonly known as the coastal honeysuckle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its adaptability to coastal environments makes it a hardy species that thrives in sandy soils and saline conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in coastal ecosystems."
