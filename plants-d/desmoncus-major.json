    "intro": "Desmoncus major, commonly known as the giant cup fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a unique structure with a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
