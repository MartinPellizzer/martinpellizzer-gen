    "intro": "Delphinium viscosum, commonly known as sticky larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a sticky, glandular substance, giving it its common name. Delphinium viscosum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
