    "intro": "Doria digitata, commonly known as the fingerleaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble fingers, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the forest floor. Its leaves are typically bi-colored, with a light green upper surface and a darker green underside. Doria digitata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
