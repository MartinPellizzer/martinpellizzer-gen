    "intro": "Dryopteris ilicifolia, commonly known as the holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that resemble holly leaves, hence its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically arching and can reach lengths of up to two meters, making it a striking addition to woodland gardens."
