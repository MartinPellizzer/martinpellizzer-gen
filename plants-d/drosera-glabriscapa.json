    "intro": "Drosera glabriscapa, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
