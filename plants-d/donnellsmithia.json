    "intro": "Donnellsmithia, commonly known as the Smith's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and slender, terrestrial growth habit. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Donnellsmithia has a unique root system that allows it to absorb nutrients from the soil efficiently. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered a critically endangered species."
