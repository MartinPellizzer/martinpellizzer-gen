    "intro": "Draba orbiculata, commonly known as the roundleaf whitlow grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine environments. The plant produces basal rosettes of narrow, silver-green leaves and bears small, yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences, and the plant is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Draba orbiculata is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers."
