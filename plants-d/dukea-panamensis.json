    "intro": "Dukea panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian wax palm, is a tall, slender palm native to Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and long, clustered inflorescences. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its trunk is covered in a thick layer of wax, which helps protect it from pests and environmental stress. Dukea panamensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
