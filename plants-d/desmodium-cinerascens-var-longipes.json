It features trifoliate leaves with a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a useful plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
