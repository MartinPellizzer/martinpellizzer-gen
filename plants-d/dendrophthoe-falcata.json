    "intro": "Dendrophthoe falcata, commonly known as the Indian ghost plant, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is known for its unique hemiparasitic lifestyle, deriving some nutrients from its host while performing photosynthesis. The plant has a slender, vine-like structure with small, scale-like leaves and produces yellowish-orange flowers. It typically grows on trees such as teak and mango, attaching itself to the host with specialized structures called haustoria. Due to its elusive nature and ghostly appearance, it is often considered a rare and enigmatic species in its habitat."
