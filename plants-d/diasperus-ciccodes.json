    "intro": "Diasperus ciccodes, commonly known as the spiny leaf beetle, is a species of leaf beetle characterized by its distinctive spiny appearance and metallic green coloration. It belongs to the family Chrysomelidae and is native to regions in Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant it feeds on, often a species of Acacia, provides both food and habitat for the beetle. Its life cycle includes egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages, with the larvae typically feeding on the foliage of its host plant. The beetle's unique morphology and ecological role make it an important subject in studies of plant-insect interactions."
