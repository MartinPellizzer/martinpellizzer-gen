    "intro": "Dicranolepis mannii, commonly known as the African fern or broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The plant is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store moisture in arid environments. Dicranolepis mannii thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories and rocky outcrops."
