    "intro": "Dendrobium shepherdii, commonly known as the Sunda Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly colorful, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its tropical environment. Dendrobium shepherdii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
