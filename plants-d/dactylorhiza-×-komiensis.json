    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 komiensis, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces tall, erect stems with lance-shaped leaves and bears showy, fragrant flowers in shades of purple and white. It is characterized by its complex hybrid origin, resulting from crosses between Dactylorhiza fuchsii and Dactylorhiza maculata. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in gardens and protected in the wild."
