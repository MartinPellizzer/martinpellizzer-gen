    "intro": "Dilophotriche, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their intricate, often showy flowers that resemble spiders, hence their common name. They are native to various regions in South America, particularly in Brazil and Peru, where they thrive in humid, tropical environments. Dilophotriche species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks for support. Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structure and their role in pollination by specific insect species."
