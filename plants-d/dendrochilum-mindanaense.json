    "intro": "Dendrochilum mindanaense, commonly known as the Mindanao tree orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant has a pseudobulbous structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting to its tropical rainforest habitat. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
