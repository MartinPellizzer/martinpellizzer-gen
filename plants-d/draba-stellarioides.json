    "intro": "Draba stellarioides, commonly known as the star-like whitlowgrass, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Draba stellarioides is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits."
