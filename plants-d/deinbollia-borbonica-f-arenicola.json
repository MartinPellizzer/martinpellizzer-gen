    "intro": "Deinbollia borbonica f. arenicola, commonly known as the sand dune spurge, is a variant of the genus Deinbollia native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean. This plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers, adapted to thrive in sandy, coastal environments. It possesses a robust root system that helps it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils. The plant is often found in dune ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and high temperatures makes it well-suited to its harsh habitat."
