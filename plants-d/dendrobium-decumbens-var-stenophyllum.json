    "intro": "Dendrobium decumbens var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dendrobium, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically during the warm season. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
