    "intro": "Dryopteris sorbifolia var. confertivenosa, commonly known as the dense-leaf wood fern, is a variant of the sorbifolia fern species. It is a perennial plant characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are densely packed, giving it a lush appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
