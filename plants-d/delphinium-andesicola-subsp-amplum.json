    "intro": "Delphinium andesicola subsp. amplum, commonly known as the Andean larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
