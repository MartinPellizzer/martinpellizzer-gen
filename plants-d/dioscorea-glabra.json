    "intro": "Dioscorea glabra, commonly known as yam, is a vine species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and later develops capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture. Dioscorea glabra is valued not only for its nutritional content but also for its traditional medicinal uses."
