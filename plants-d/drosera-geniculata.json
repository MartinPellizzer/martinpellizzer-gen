    "intro": "Drosera geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, zigzagging stems that help it climb and trap prey. The plant produces small, sticky glands on its leaves that secrete a sweet-smelling mucus to lure insects. These insects become stuck and are digested by the plant's enzymes. Drosera geniculata thrives in moist, boggy environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in dense vegetation."
