It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a straight trunk and dark, dense bark. The leaves are alternate, pinnate, and often have a distinctive dark green color. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in axillary or terminal inflorescences, and it produces flat, pod-like fruits. The wood is highly valued for its density and dark color, making it a prized material in the furniture and musical instrument industries."
