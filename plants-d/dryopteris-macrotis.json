    "intro": "Dryopteris macrotis, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to three feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds have a distinctive shape with a broad, shield-like outline, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
