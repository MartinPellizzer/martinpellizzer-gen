    "intro": "Dodonaea viscosa subsp. burmanniana, commonly known as the burr daisy or velvetleaf, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia and parts of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, woody, spiny fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often forming dense thickets. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
