    "intro": "Dryopteris angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a slender, upright habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
