    "intro": "Digitaria humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's digitaria, is a grass species native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often reach heights of up to 1 meter. The leaves are narrow and flat, with a smooth surface, and the inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
