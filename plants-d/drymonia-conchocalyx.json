    "intro": "Drymonia conchocalyx, commonly known as the African sycamore, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in woodland and rocky areas. Drymonia conchocalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique foliage and hardiness."
