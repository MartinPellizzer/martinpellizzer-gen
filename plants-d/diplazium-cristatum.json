    "intro": "Diplazium cristatum, commonly known as the crowned fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, upright fronds with a crown-like appearance at the base. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. Diplazium cristatum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded forest floors."
