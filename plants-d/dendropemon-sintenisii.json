    "intro": "Dendropemon sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenisi orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in its natural range."
