    "intro": "Dracaena voluta, commonly known as the spiral dracaena, is a tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, spiraling arrangement of leaves that give it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a smooth, greenish-brown bark. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a waxy texture, often with a bluish-green or dark green hue. Dracaena voluta is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and minimal watering requirements."
