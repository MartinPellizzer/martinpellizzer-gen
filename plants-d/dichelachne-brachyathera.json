It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed areas and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a common weed in agricultural and natural environments."
