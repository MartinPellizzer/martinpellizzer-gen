    "intro": "Didymopanax plurispicatus, commonly known as the spiny hollies, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually pinnate and have a glossy, dark green appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, berry-like fruits. Its bark and leaves contain various bioactive compounds, making it of interest in traditional medicine. However, it is also known for its defensive spines, which help protect it from herbivores."
