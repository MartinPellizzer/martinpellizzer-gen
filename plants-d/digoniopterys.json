It features large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, spongy petioles. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, often at night. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize the soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Botanically, Digoniopterys is classified within the family Araceae, characterized by its unique floral structure and aquatic adaptations."
