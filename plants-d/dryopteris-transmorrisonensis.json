    "intro": "Dryopteris transmorrisonensis, commonly known as Morrison's wood fern, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it can access the moisture necessary for its growth. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for the survival of this unique botanical species."
