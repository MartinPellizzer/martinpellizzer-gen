    "intro": "Dryopteris huanglungensis, commonly known as the Huanglung fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spores are dispersed by wind. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
