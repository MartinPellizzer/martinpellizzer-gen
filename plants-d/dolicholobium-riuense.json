    "intro": "Dolicholobium riuense, commonly known as the Rio Grande thornbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant is adapted to dry climates, featuring small, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, arranged in clusters, and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The seeds are enclosed in tough pods, which open to release the seeds when mature."
