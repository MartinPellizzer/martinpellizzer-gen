    "intro": "Dianella revoluta var. tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flax lily, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to New Zealand. It features narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are often blue-green in color, with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in late summer to autumn, followed by blue-black berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value and hardiness make it a popular choice for native landscaping."
