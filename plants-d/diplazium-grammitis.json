    "intro": "Diplazium grammitis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201360 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its fronds are bi-pinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. Diplazium grammitis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
