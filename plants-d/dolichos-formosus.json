    "intro": "Dolichos formosus, commonly known as the Taiwan horsegram, is a leguminous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It is valued for its nutritional content, particularly its high protein and fiber levels, and is cultivated for both human consumption and animal feed. The plant's ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
