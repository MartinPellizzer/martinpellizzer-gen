    "intro": "Daphne pillopillo, commonly known as the Chilean daphne, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Chile. It features aromatic, glandular leaves that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowering period makes it a notable ornamental plant in gardens, though it is toxic to humans and animals. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in coastal scrub habitats."
