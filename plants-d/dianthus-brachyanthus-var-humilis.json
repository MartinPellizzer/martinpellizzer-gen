    "intro": "Dianthus brachyanthus var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf carnation, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are narrow and grass-like, and its stems are generally short and upright. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a bedding plant. Its compact form and prolonged blooming period make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental color in smaller spaces."
