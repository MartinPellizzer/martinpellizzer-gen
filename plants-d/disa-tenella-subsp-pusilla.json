    "intro": "Disa tenella subsp. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf pink orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces delicate, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and small plant collections."
