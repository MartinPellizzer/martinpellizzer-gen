    "intro": "Durio pinangianus, commonly known as the Pahang durian, is a tropical fruit-bearing plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its large, spiky husk that encases a creamy, aromatic pulp. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it relies on specific pollinators for successful reproduction. The fruit matures over several months and is highly valued for its unique flavor and culinary uses."
