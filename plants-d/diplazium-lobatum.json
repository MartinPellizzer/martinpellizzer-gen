    "intro": "Diplazium lobatum, commonly known as the serrated shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments with serrated edges. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a distinctive feature of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Diplazium lobatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in both natural and cultivated settings."
