    "intro": "Dryopteris subcochleata, commonly known as the narrow-crested wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often curling fronds that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in the forest understory."
