    "intro": "Delphinium deserti, commonly known as the desert larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to minimize water loss in its harsh environment. Delphinium deserti is part of the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many toxic plants. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in dry, desert conditions."
