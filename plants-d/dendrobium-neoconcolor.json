    "intro": "Dendrobium neoconcolor, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several feet in length. Its flowers are typically yellow or golden in color, with a distinctive pattern of darker markings. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
