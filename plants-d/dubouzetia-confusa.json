    "intro": "Dubouzetia confusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its fragile nature and limited distribution, Dubouzetia confusa is considered critically endangered in the wild."
