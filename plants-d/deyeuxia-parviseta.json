It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a prominent midrib. Deyeuxia parviseta plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
