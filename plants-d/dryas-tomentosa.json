    "intro": "Dryas tomentosa, commonly known as the mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to cold climates. It features a low-growing rosette of silvery-gray, woolly leaves that help insulate it against harsh winter conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Its unique adaptations make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
