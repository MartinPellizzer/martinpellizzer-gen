It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a hairy surface. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Dicliptera nyangana is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
