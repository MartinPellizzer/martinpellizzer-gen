    "intro": "Diplocaulobium dendrocolla, commonly known as the tree-attached liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its flattened, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically attached to tree bark or other moist surfaces. The plant exhibits a complex morphology with distinct dorsal and ventral surfaces, often featuring intricate patterns of cells and canals. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, commonly found in temperate and tropical forests. Due to its specialized habitat, it plays a role in ecological succession and contributes to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
