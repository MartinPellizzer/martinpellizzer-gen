    "intro": "Dendrobium lawesii var. salmonicolor, commonly known as the Salmon-colored Dendrobium, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. Its flowers are typically pink or salmon-colored, with a delicate, fragrant aroma. It is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
