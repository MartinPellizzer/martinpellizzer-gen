    "intro": "Deschampsia setacea f. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous tussock grass, is a variant of the slender hair grass. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. One notable botanical trait is its viviparous reproduction, where seeds are formed on the mother plant and can germinate before dispersal. This adaptation enhances its ability to colonize disturbed or nutrient-poor soils."
