    "intro": "Dendrochilum loheri, commonly known as the Loher's tree orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees, using them for support rather than deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Dendrochilum loheri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
