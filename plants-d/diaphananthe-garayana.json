    "intro": "Diaphananthe garayana, commonly known as the Guianan sand mat, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small yellow flowers arranged in composite inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found on rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
