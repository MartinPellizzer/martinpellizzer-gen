    "intro": "Dissotis falcipila, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often narrow and tapering, with a distinctive falcate (sickle-shaped) appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in dense spikes and are pollinated by wind. Dissotis falcipila plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
