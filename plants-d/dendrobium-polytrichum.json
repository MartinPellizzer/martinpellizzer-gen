    "intro": "Dendrobium polytrichum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, zigzagging growth pattern and its ability to climb using its aerial roots. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers during the rainy season. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium polytrichum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
