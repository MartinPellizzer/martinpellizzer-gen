    "intro": "Dracaena angustifolia var. honoriae, commonly known as the Honoria's narrowleaf dracaena, is a compact, upright plant with dark green, narrow, strap-like leaves that have a slight sheen. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in bright, indirect light with moderate humidity. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red berries, though flowering is rare in cultivation. It is prized for its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive indoors with minimal care. Its slow growth rate makes it an excellent choice for small spaces and container gardening."
