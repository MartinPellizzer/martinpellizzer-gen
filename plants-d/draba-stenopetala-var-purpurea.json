    "intro": "Draba stenopetala var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple-flowered rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cold, arid conditions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss. The flowers, which are usually purple or pink, bloom in early spring and attract various pollinators such as bees and flies."
