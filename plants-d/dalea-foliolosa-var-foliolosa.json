    "intro": "Dalea foliolosa var. foliolosa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with narrow, linear leaflets, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in gravelly soils and open habitats. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and its role in stabilizing soils in degraded landscapes."
