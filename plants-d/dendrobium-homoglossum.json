    "intro": "Dendrobium homoglossum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a branched stem system and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white. The plant has fleshy, strap-like leaves that store water, adapting it to its natural habitat. It blooms during the dry season, typically from December to March, and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Dendrobium homoglossum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
