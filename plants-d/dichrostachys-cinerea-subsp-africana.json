    "intro": "Dichrostachys cinerea subsp. africana, commonly known as African stranglewood, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive."
