It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has soft, hairy leaves that give it a velvety appearance, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in alpine meadows. Delphinium subvelutinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
