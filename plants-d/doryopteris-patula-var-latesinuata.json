It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are typically golden-green in color, with a smooth, waxy texture. The plant features a compact, clump-forming growth habit, making it well-suited for shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are usually divided into broad, lance-shaped segments that contribute to its ornamental appeal. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and ability to thrive in woodland settings."
