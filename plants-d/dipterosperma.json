    "intro": "Dipterosperma, commonly known as the African milkwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Dipterosperma species are valued for their hard, durable wood and their role in traditional medicine."
