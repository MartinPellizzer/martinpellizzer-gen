    "intro": "Dombeya cerasiflora, commonly known as the cherry-flower dombeya, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Africa. It is characterized by its showy, pink or white flowers that resemble cherry blossoms, which bloom in early spring. The plant has simple, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, red berries that mature in the fall. Dombeya cerasiflora thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators and bird species."
