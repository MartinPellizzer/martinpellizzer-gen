It typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. Its pods are slender and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
