    "intro": "Dendrosenecio adnivalis var. petiolatus, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle contrast to its textured foliage. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, enabling it to survive in arid and cold environments. This variety is distinguished by its elongated leaf stalks, which give it a unique appearance among its relatives."
