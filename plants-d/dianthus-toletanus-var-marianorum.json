It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces flowers that are often clustered at the ends of its stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
