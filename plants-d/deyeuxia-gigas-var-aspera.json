    "intro": "Deyeuxia gigas var. aspera, commonly known as rough false rice, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along waterways. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. It is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its competitive growth habit."
