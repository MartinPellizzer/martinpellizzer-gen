    "intro": "Dryopteris parasitica var. procurrens, commonly known as the creeping wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense, compact fronds. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a dark green color and a leathery texture, and they produce sporangia on the underside of the leaves. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more spreading fronds compared to the typical form of Dryopteris parasitica. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small organisms."
