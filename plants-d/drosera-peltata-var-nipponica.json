It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wetlands. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually pink or red, and bloom in late summer. The variety is noted for its ornamental value and unique method of nutrient acquisition through insect digestion."
