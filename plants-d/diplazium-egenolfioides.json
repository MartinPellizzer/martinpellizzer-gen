    "intro": "Diplazium egenolfioides, commonly known as the broad-leaf staghorn fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive, branching structure resembling a staghorn. The plant typically grows epiphytically on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Diplazium egenolfioides is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and ease of care."
