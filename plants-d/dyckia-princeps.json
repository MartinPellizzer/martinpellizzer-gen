    "intro": "Dyckia princeps, commonly known as the royal dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Dyckia princeps is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
