    "intro": "Drypetes macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf drypetes, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. This species is valued for its timber and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
