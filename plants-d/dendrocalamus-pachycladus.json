It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like India, Myanmar, and Thailand. This species is characterized by its thick, sturdy culms that can grow up to 30 meters in height. The leaves are long, narrow, and often have a bluish-green hue, while the inflorescence is a panicle with small, inconspicuous flowers. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats and is also valued for its strong, lightweight material used in construction and crafts."
