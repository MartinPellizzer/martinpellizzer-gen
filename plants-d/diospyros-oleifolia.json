    "intro": "Diospyros oleifolia, commonly known as the oil drum tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are typically orange-red when mature. Its leaves and bark contain compounds that have been traditionally used in folk medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
