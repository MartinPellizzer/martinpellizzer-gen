    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa var. rhenana, commonly known as the Rhenish hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically have a bluish-green coloration. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous fine, silky flowers that are wind-pollinated. This variety is often found in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained to wet soils."
