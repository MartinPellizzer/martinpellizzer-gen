    "intro": "Dianthus pumilio, commonly known as the alpine pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or red, with a distinctive, slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant has basal leaves that are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Dianthus pumilio is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to bloom in harsh conditions."
