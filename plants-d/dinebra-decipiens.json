    "intro": "Dinebra decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive trillium, is a striking member of the Melanthiaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant features a single, showy white flower with three petals and three sepals, which can resemble a more familiar species, leading to its deceptive common name. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three broad, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
