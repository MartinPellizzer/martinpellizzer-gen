It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds with a distinctive pattern of narrow, parallel veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy scales. The fronds are usually evergreen, retaining their foliage throughout the year."
