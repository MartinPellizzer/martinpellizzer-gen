    "intro": "Dendrobium annamense, commonly known as the Annam orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical climates. Its flowers are typically showy, with a range of colors including white, yellow, and pink, often with a distinctive fragrance. Dendrobium annamense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to various growing conditions."
