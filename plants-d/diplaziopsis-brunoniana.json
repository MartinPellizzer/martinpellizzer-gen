    "intro": "Diplaziopsis brunoniana, commonly known as the Brunon's fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. Diplaziopsis brunoniana is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
