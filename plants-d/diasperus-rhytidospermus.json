    "intro": "Diasperus rhytidospermus, commonly known as the rough-seeded grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, rough-textured seeds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Diasperus rhytidospermus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
