    "intro": "Danthonia domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican grass, is a species of grass native to the Caribbean, particularly the island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
