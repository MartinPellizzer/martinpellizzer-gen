    "intro": "Diplopterys caduciflora, commonly known as the Amazonian beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers, which are typically followed by bright blue, fleshy berries that ripen in the rainy season. These berries are not only ornamental but also serve as a food source for various wildlife species. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of the tropical flora in its native habitat."
