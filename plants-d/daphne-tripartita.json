    "intro": "Daphne tripartita, commonly known as the three-parted daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features aromatic, glandular leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, which bloom in early spring. Its berries are dark blue or black and contain toxic compounds, making the plant potentially harmful to humans and animals. Daphne tripartita is often cultivated for its ornamental value and distinctive fragrance."
