    "intro": "Delosperma aliwalense, commonly known as the Aliwal succulent, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
