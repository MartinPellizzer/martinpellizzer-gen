It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light. Dyckia beloisae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in suitable growing conditions."
