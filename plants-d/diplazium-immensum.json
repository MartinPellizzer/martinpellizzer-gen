    "intro": "Diplazium immensum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, segmented stems and large, compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, ovate pinnae that are arranged in a distinctive, feather-like pattern. Diplazium immensum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
