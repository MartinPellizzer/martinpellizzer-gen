    "intro": "Duvernoia extensa, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant belongs to the family Salviniaceae and is closely related to the water ferns. Its unique structure allows it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
