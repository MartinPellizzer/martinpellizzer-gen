    "intro": "Desmanthus strictus, commonly known as the narrowleaf desmanthus, is a perennial legume native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, elliptical pods containing several seeds. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments. Desmanthus strictus is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration and livestock forage."
