It is a biennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces yellow flowers in umbels. Its fruit is a small, dry, ridged schizocarp that splits into two parts when mature. The species is notable for its hairy, rough-textured appearance, which gives it its common name."
