    "intro": "Dendrophthoe koenigiana, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some photosynthetic ability from its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers and red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. It is native to regions of India and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked, making it both ecologically significant and potentially harmful."
