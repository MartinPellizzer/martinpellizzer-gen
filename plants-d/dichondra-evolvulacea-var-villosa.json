    "intro": "Dichondra evolvulacea var. villosa, commonly known as hairy dichondra, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its trailing habit and dense foliage. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread rapidly and form a lush, carpet-like mat."
