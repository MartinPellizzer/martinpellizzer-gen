    "intro": "Dryopteris flexuosa, commonly known as the barren woods fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a wavy or undulating pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris flexuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
