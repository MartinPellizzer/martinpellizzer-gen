    "intro": "Digitaria ischaemum f. rubescens, commonly known as red-stemmed crabgrass, is a variant of the common crabgrass species. It is a warm-season annual grass that typically grows in disturbed soils and sunny environments. The plant features slender, reddish stems that distinguish it from other crabgrass varieties. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture. It produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that mature into seeds, contributing to its invasive potential in agricultural settings."
