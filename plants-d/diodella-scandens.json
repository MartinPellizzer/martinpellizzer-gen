    "intro": "Diodella scandens, commonly known as the climbing dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems that often climb or trail along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy white seeds dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils. Diodella scandens is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in other open, sunny habitats."
