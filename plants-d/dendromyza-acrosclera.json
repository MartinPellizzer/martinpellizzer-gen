    "intro": "Dendromyza acrosclera, commonly known as the coastal broom, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Dendromyza acrosclera plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
