    "intro": "Daphne myrtilloides, commonly known as the sweetbox or European sweetbox, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, dark green foliage that turns reddish in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale pink, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are oval-shaped with smooth margins and emit a subtle, sweet scent when crushed. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in hedges or as a specimen plant in gardens."
