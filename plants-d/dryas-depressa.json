    "intro": "Dryas depressa, commonly known as the mat-forming dwarf shrub, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the short growing season. Its leaves are typically broad and rounded, and they remain green throughout the year. Dryas depressa is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
