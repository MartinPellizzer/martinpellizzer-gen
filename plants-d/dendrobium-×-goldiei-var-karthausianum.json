    "intro": "Dendrobium \u00d7 goldiei var. karthausianum, commonly known as the Karthausianum orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces striking, long-lasting flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to flourish. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
