    "intro": "Dryopteris vestigiata, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that create a finely textured look. Dryopteris vestigiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
