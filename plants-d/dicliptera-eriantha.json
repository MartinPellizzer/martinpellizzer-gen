    "intro": "Dicliptera eriantha, commonly known as the woolly blady grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, hairy structures on its leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats in wet or seasonally flooded soils. Dicliptera eriantha is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
