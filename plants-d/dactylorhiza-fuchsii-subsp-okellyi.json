    "intro": "Dactylorhiza fuchsii subsp. okellyi, commonly known as the Okelly's marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive green throat. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland habitats. It has a complex root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This subspecies is considered rare and is protected in many regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
