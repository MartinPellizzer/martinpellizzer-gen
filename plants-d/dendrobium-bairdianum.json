    "intro": "Dendrobium bairdianum, commonly known as the Baird's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces long, thin pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or green with red or purple markings, and they bloom in clusters during the wet season. Dendrobium bairdianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
