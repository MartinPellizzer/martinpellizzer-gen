    "intro": "Dianella nemorosa var. serrulata, commonly known as the serrated lily or narrowleaf flax lily, is a perennial evergreen plant native to New Zealand. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often serrated along the edges, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late winter to early spring, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in shaded to semi-shaded conditions and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing ground cover."
