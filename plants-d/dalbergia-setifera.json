    "intro": "Dalbergia setifera, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a fine, even texture, making it highly valued for furniture and musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, fragrant yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
