    "intro": "Daboecia polifolia var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf rock heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal areas of South Africa. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
