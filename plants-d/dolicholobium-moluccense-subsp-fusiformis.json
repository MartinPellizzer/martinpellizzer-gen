    "intro": "Dolicholobium moluccense subsp. fusiformis, commonly known as the Moluccan fusiform lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found in specific tropical regions. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose or foliose in form. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal component, which together form the lichen body. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found on rock surfaces or tree trunks. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable indicator species for assessing environmental health."
