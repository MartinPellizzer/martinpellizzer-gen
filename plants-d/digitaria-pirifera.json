    "intro": "Digitaria pirifera, commonly known as the pineapple grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny flowers, which eventually develop into small, dry fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
