    "intro": "Dyckia tobatiensis, commonly known as the Tobati Dyckia, is a species of flowering plant in the bromeliad family, Bromeliaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red in color. Dyckia tobatiensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish."
