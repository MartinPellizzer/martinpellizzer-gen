    "intro": "Draba czuensis, commonly known as the Czuen\u2019s rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Draba czuensis has a short life cycle, often completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
