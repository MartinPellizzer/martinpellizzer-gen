    "intro": "Decaisnina pedicellata, commonly known as the rock fig, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Decaisnina pedicellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and fruit."
