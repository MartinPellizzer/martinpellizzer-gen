    "intro": "Digaster, commonly known as the dwarf sea holly, is a small flowering plant belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. It is native to coastal regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. Its succulent stems allow it to store water, adapting it to its arid environment. Digaster is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
