    "intro": "Dichanthelium dichotomum var. glabrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leaf dichotomous grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are linear with a smooth, glabrous surface. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small, clustered flower-bearing structures. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf pubescence compared to other varieties within the species."
