    "intro": "Dactylorchis incarnata var. divaricata, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, grass-like leaves and its striking, pinkish-white flower spikes that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, a feature common in the orchid family. The species is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
