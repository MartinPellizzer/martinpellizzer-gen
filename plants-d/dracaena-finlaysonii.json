    "intro": "Dracaena finlaysonii, commonly known as the Finlayson's dracaena, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to southern China and northern Vietnam. It features narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or bronze tinge along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena finlaysonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in indoor gardening due to its air-purifying properties."
