    "intro": "Dolia clavata var. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent clubmoss, is a rare and delicate fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, club-shaped sporophytes that are covered in fine, soft pubescence, giving it its common name. This variant is native to specific regions in eastern North America, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest floors. Its reproductive structures are closely clustered, and it relies on spores for propagation rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
