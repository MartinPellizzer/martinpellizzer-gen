    "intro": "Desmodium franchetii, commonly known as velvet bean or hairy nightshade, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Desmodium franchetii is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural settings."
