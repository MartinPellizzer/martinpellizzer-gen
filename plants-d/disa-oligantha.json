    "intro": "Disa oligantha, commonly known as the violet disa, is a striking member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of delicate, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Disa oligantha is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
