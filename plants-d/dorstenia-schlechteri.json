    "intro": "Dorstenia schlechteri, commonly known as the African mountain cucumber, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, cucurbit-like fruit that splits open when mature. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. Despite its unusual appearance, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in local communities."
