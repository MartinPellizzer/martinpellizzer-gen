    "intro": "Dryopteris basiattenuata, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, broad, shield-like shape. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
