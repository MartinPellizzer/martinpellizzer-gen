    "intro": "Dryopteris tetrapinnata, commonly known as the four-pinnate wood fern, is a deciduous fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with multiple pinnae that are often curved and have a distinctive, delicate appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small animals."
