    "intro": "Daucus asturiarum, commonly known as the Asturian carrot, is a rare wild plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are typically small and not as developed as those of the common carrot, making it more of a wild, ornamental species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
