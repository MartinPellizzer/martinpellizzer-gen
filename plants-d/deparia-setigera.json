    "intro": "Deparia setigera, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a silvery or hairy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the forest understory."
