    "intro": "Diapedium longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved diapedium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic properties. The species is characterized by its delicate appearance and preference for moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats."
