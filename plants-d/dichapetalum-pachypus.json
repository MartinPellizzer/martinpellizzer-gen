    "intro": "Dichapetalum pachypus, commonly known as the African velvet tamarind, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, oval seeds. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a tendency to form dense thickets, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The species is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
