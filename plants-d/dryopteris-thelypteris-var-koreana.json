    "intro": "Dryopteris thelypteris var. koreana, commonly known as the Korean shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to Korea. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of the Dryopteris genus."
