    "intro": "Distylium racemosum, commonly known as the racemose distylium, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, which are elongated clusters of flowers. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a leathery texture, adapting to the acidic and well-drained soils it prefers. Distylium racemosum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and swampy areas."
