    "intro": "Davallia splendens, commonly known as the \"Cabbage Tree Fern,\" is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a tall, slender trunk covered with a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. The plant produces fronds that are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving it a feathery appearance. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. This fern is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive indoors with proper care."
