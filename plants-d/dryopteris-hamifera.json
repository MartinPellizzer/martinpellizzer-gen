    "intro": "Dryopteris hamifera, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a golden hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Dryopteris hamifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticultural settings."
