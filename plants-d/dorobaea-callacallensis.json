    "intro": "Dorobaea callacallensis, commonly known as the Andes bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to the cool, dry conditions of its habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
