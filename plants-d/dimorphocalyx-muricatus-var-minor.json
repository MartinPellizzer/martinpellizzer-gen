    "intro": "Dimorphocalyx muricatus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. This variety is less common than the typical form of Dimorphocalyx muricatus and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
