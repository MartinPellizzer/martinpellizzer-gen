These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Comoros Islands. Desmostachys species are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers and thick, fleshy leaves that help them retain moisture in their native habitats. They are popular as houseplants due to their ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care. The genus includes several species, such as Desmostachys falcata and Desmostachys oppositifolia, which are valued for their ornamental beauty."
