    "intro": "Dalbergia foliacea, commonly known as the leafy ebony, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces hard, dark wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
