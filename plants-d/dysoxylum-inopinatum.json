    "intro": "Dysoxylum inopinatum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows to a height of 20-30 meters and has compound leaves with opposite arrangement. Its flowers are small and yellowish, often appearing in clusters, and it produces woody capsules as fruit. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered vulnerable in many regions."
