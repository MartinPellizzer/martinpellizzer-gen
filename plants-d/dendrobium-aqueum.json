    "intro": "Dendrobium aqueum, commonly known as the water orchid, is a type of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of aerial roots that absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters along its stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture without being waterlogged. Dendrobium aqueum is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine."
