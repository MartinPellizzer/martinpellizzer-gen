    "intro": "Davallia bipinnatifida, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, with a central rosette of overlapping, leathery leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a velvety texture, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens. The plant is also valued for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and its air-purifying qualities."
