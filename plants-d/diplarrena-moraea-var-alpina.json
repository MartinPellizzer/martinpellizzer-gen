    "intro": "Diplarrena moraea var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine diplarrena, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
