    "intro": "Dudleya compacta, commonly known as the compact dudleya, is a succulent plant native to California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like growth pattern with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to rocky and coastal environments, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. Dudleya compacta is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
