    "intro": "Dracaena boscii, commonly known as the Madagascar dragon tree, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish tinge along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Dracaena boscii thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a desirable ornamental plant."
