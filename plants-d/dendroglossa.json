    "intro": "Dendroglossa, commonly known as the tree toad, is a genus of frogs belonging to the family Centrolenidae. These amphibians are native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where they inhabit humid forests and leaf litter. Dendroglossa species are characterized by their distinctive, often colorful skin patterns and their ability to climb trees, which is reflected in their common name. They are typically small to medium-sized frogs with short limbs and adhesive toe pads that aid in climbing. These frogs play an important role in their ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for various predators."
