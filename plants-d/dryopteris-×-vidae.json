    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 vidae, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable offspring and is typically propagated through division of the rhizomes."
