It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, spherical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and pastures. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment."
