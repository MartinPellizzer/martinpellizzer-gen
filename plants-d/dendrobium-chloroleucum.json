    "intro": "Dendrobium chloroleucum, commonly known as the white-stemmed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive yellow throat. Its leaves are typically broad and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it blooms throughout the year in suitable conditions. Dendrobium chloroleucum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
