    "intro": "Daviesia gracilis, commonly known as the slender Daviesia, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests, thriving in well-drained soils. It is a shrub that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with grey-green foliage that provides a striking contrast to its bright yellow or orange flowers. Daviesia gracilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
