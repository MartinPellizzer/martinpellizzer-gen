    "intro": "Desmodium lindleyi, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its pods are cylindrical and contain several elliptical seeds, which are encased in a thin, papery membrane. Desmodium lindleyi is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable in agricultural systems."
