It is a perennial plant that typically grows in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a smooth texture. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Diplachne hackeliana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
