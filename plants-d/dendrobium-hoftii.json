    "intro": "Dendrobium hoftii, commonly known as the Hoft's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces erect, branched inflorescences bearing showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often arranged in two rows along the pseudobulbs. Dendrobium hoftii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
