    "intro": "Delostoma gracile, commonly known as the slender false nettle, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Onagraceae. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Delostoma gracile is often found in temperate regions and is relatively uncommon in the wild."
