It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful flowers that resemble other plants or animals, a trait known as mimicry. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The flowers bloom in clusters and are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
