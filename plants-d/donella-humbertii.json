    "intro": "Donella humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's donella, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features include a slender stem, aromatic foliage, and a short flowering period during the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
