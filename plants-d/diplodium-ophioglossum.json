    "intro": "Diplodium ophioglossum, commonly known as the broad-leaved adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, tongue-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Diplodium ophioglossum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
