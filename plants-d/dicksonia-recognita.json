    "intro": "Dicksonia recognita, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The fronds are covered in a fine, silvery down, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has cultural significance in M\u0101ori traditions."
