    "intro": "Diasperus zeylanicus, commonly known as the Ceylon sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its fragrant, aromatic wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and is protected in several regions."
