    "intro": "Discoclaoxylon, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its hard, dense wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plants typically grow as small trees or shrubs, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. They have simple, opposite leaves and produce small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds."
