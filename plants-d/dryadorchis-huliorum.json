    "intro": "Dryadorchis huliorum, commonly known as the Hulio orchid, is a species of orchid native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its root system is specialized for nutrient absorption from the surrounding soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
