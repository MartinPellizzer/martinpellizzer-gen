    "intro": "Dryopteris indusiata var. simasakii, commonly known as the Simala shield fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into a series of lance-shaped pinnae. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in suitable climates."
