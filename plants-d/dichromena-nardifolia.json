    "intro": "Dichromena nardifolia, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas of the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Dichromena nardifolia is adapted to moist soils and often grows in marshy or swampy environments. Its aromatic properties have made it historically used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb."
