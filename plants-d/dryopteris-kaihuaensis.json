    "intro": "Dryopteris kaihuaensis, commonly known as the Kaihua water fern, is a rare species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
