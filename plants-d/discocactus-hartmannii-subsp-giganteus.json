    "intro": "Discocactus hartmannii subsp. giganteus, commonly known as the giant discocactus, is a large, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to several meters in height, adapted to store water in its fleshy tissues. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. The species is well-suited to xerophytic environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh, dry climates."
