    "intro": "Diothonea sodiroi, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a unique evergreen tree native to the Socotra Archipelago. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-shaped crown and its scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around the branches. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a rare and long-lived species. Its cones are small and contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The Socotra cypress is also notable for its ecological importance in its native habitat."
