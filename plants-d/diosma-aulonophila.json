It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a hairy texture, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds.
