    "intro": "Deyeuxia macouniana, commonly known as the Macoun's flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a distinctive, flat, triangular stem. Deyeuxia macouniana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils and support local wildlife."
