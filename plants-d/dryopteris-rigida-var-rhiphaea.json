    "intro": "Dryopteris rigida var. rhiphaea, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and serrated, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and naturalized landscapes."
