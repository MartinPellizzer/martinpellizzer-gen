    "intro": "Diplazium vestitum var. vestitum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rosette of dark green, velvety, and leathery fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's unique texture and appearance make it a popular ornamental species in horticulture."
