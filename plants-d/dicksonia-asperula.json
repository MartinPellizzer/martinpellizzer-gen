    "intro": "Dicksonia asperula, commonly known as the rough tree fern, is a species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its trunk is composed of a mass of roots and stem tissue, which allows it to grow tall without a true trunk. The fronds are dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in shape and structure."
