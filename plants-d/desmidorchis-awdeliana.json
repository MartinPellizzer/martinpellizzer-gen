It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features include intricate leaf patterns and a short, erect stem with a single flower spike. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
