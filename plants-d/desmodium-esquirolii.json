    "intro": "Desmodium esquirolii, commonly known as the Florida desmodium, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to wetland and marshy environments, thriving in moist, acidic soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Its seeds are dispersed by water, aiding in its spread along riparian zones."
