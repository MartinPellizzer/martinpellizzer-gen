    "intro": "Dichaea neglecta, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the dry season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a specific balance of light and moisture to survive. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, Dichaea neglecta is considered a conservation concern."
