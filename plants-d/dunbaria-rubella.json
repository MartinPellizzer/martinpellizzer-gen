    "intro": "Dunbaria rubella, commonly known as the red-stemmed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often tinged with a reddish hue, especially during the growing season. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Dunbaria rubella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
