    "intro": "Dianthus piatra-neamtzui, commonly known as the Piatra-Neamtzui campion, is a rare flowering plant native to Romania. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
