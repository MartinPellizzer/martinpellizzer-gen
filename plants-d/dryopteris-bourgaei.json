    "intro": "Dryopteris bourgaei, commonly known as the Bourgeai wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically divided into multiple pinnae, with a distinctive, sometimes serrated edge. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its lush, dark green foliage."
