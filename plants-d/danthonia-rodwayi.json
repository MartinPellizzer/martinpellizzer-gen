    "intro": "Danthonia rodwayi, commonly known as the slender danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Danthonia rodwayi is adapted to dry conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological value."
