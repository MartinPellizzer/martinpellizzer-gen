    "intro": "Dactylorhiza cruenta subsp. salina, commonly known as the coastal marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the coastal regions of the British Isles. It thrives in saline, marshy environments and is adapted to withstand high salt levels in the soil. The plant produces tall, slender stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and bears small, pale green or yellowish flowers. It is classified as a protected species due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to coastal ecosystems and its role in ecological studies of salt-tolerant flora."
