    "intro": "Dryopteris peninsulae, commonly known as the Peninsula Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, wavy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in rocky or coastal habitats. Its spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Dryopteris peninsulae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
