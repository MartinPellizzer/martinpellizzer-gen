    "intro": "Dendrobium violaceominiatum, commonly known as the violet-minor orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that support its evergreen leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive white throat, blooming during the rainy season. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern."
