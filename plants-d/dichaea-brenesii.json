    "intro": "Dichaea brenesii, commonly known as the Brenes' bromeliad, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly Costa Rica and Panama. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its rosette-shaped leaves form a central pool that collects rainwater, supporting a small ecosystem. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink in color."
