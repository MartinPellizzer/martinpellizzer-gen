    "intro": "Dactylorhiza markowitschii, commonly known as the Markowitsch's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe, particularly in areas with moist, calcareous soils. The plant produces a single erect stem bearing several lance-shaped leaves and a raceme of pale yellow to greenish flowers. It is a perennial herb that typically blooms in late spring to early summer. Dactylorhiza markowitschii is notable for its specialized mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for its nutrient uptake and survival in its natural habitat."
