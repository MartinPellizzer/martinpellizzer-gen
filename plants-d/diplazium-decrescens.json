    "intro": "Diplazium decrescens, commonly known as the small-leaf water fern, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. The plant has fronds that are pinnately divided, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Diplazium decrescens produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. This species is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in humid, tropical regions."
