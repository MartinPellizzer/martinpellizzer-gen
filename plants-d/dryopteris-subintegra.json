    "intro": "Dryopteris subintegra, commonly known as the dissected wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are deeply divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it in soil. The fronds are evergreen, retaining their foliage year-round, which contributes to its ornamental value in gardens."
