    "intro": "Dianthus furcatus, commonly known as the fringed pinks, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink or white flowers with fringed petals. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Dianthus furcatus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and long blooming period from late spring to early summer."
