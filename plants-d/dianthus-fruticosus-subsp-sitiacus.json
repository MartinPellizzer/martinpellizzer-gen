    "intro": "Dianthus fruticosus subsp. sitiacus, commonly known as the Sitia thyme or rock thyme, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, compact foliage with aromatic, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-red flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry, sunny environments."
