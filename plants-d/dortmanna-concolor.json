    "intro": "Dortmanna concolor, commonly known as the smoothleaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats and sorrels. The plant typically grows in moist soils along stream banks and in wet meadows, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are smooth and elliptical, with a distinctive reddish or purple tinge on the underside. The small, greenish flowers appear in clusters and are followed by three-winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal."
