    "intro": "Desmanthus lacustris, commonly known as the lake desmanthus, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Desmanthus lacustris is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
