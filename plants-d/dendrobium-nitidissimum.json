    "intro": "Dendrobium nitidissimum, commonly known as the white dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and it produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers. Its leaves are typically elongated and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Dendrobium nitidissimum is valued in horticulture for its beauty and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
