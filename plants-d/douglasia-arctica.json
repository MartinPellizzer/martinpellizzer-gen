    "intro": "Douglasia arctica, commonly known as the Arctic douglasia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Geraniaceae. It is native to the Arctic regions of northern Europe and North America, where it thrives in cold, rocky environments. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in early summer, often in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette shape to protect against harsh winter conditions. Douglasia arctica plays a role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
