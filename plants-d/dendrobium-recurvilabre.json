    "intro": "Dendrobium recurvilabre, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, thin stems that often coil and twist, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive, recurved lip. Dendrobium recurvilabre is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
