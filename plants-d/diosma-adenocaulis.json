    "intro": "Diosma adenocaulis, commonly known as the woolly diosma, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Diosma adenocaulis is an important plant in its native habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain wildlife."
