    "intro": "Danthonia forskaolii subsp. persica, commonly known as Persian feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of southwestern Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a delicate, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle floral display. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and requires minimal water once established. This subspecies is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
