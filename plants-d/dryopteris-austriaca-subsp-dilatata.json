    "intro": "Dryopteris austriaca subsp. dilatata, commonly known as the Austrian wood fern, is a fern species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its large, triangular-shaped fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinct central vein and serrated margins. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. The foliage is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden conditions."
