    "intro": "Davallia pedata, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical evergreen fern characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a bird's nest. It features a short, thick rhizome with clustered, light green, lance-shaped leaves that are often curled at the tips. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is native to various regions in Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Davallia pedata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
