    "intro": "Diphaca trichocarpa, commonly known as the hairy leaf diphaca, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Diphaca trichocarpa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded forest understories."
