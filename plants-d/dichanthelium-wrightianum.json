    "intro": "Dichanthelium wrightianum, commonly known as Wright's panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, branched flower clusters. Dichanthelium wrightianum plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
