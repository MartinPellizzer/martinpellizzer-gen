It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It grows in rocky or alpine environments and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
