    "intro": "Delphinium ceratophorum var. robustum, commonly known as the robust delphinium, is a tall, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, blue to purple spires of flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, thriving in cooler climates. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its diverse and often ornamental species."
