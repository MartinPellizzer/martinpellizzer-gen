It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, typically in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for both horticultural and ornamental purposes."
