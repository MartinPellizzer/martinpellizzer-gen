    "intro": "Didymochlaena solomonensis, commonly known as the Solomon Islands nettle, is a flowering plant native to the Solomon Islands. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its stinging hairs, it can be a defensive mechanism against herbivores and human contact."
