    "intro": "Dryopteris venusta, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green fronds that are often adorned with golden or bronze markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that adds ornamental value to gardens."
