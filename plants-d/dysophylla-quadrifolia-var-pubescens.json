It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
