    "intro": "Dendrocnide oblanceolata, commonly known as the stinging lily or mountain stinger, is a species of flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its lance-shaped, hairy leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is known for its highly irritant hairs, which can cause severe skin reactions in humans. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understorey areas. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential hazard to those who encounter it."
