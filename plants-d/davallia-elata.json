    "intro": "Davallia elata, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and often produce small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori. Davallia elata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care."
