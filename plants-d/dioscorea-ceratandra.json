    "intro": "Dioscorea ceratandra, commonly known as the horned yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped tubers. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and tend to climb using tendrils. The tubers of Dioscorea ceratandra are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures."
