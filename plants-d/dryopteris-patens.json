    "intro": "Dryopteris patens, commonly known as the broad male fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-rich soils. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
