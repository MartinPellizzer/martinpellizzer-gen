    "intro": "Dichrocephala abyssinica, commonly known as African blue milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to East Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom throughout the dry season. Its milkweed sap contains latex, which can be toxic if ingested. Dichrocephala abyssinica is adapted to arid environments and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas."
