    "intro": "Drynaria cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaf fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with erect, clustered fronds that have a distinctive heart-shaped outline. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Drynaria cordifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
