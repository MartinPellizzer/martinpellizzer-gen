    "intro": "Dorstenia quarrei, commonly known as the \"Bottle Tree,\" is a unique member of the Moraceae family, native to the humid lowlands of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, swollen stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, elongated fruits. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture. Dorstenia quarrei is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and ability to adapt to various growing conditions."
