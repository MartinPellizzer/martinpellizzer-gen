    "intro": "Donnellsmithia madrensis, commonly known as the Madre\u00f1os pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, elongated cones and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant thrives in high-altitude, temperate climates with well-drained soils. Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique botanical species."
