    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa subsp. pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that thrives in cold, arid environments. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to poor, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous terrain. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
