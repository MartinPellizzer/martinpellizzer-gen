    "intro": "Daphne pendula var. concolor, commonly known as the silver-leafed daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, glandular leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. However, it is toxic to humans and animals, requiring careful handling and placement."
