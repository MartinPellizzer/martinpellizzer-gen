    "intro": "Draba bruniifolia var. ericifolia, commonly known as the Ericaceous Draba, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variant is distinguished by its association with ericaceous (heath-like) vegetation, contributing to its specific ecological niche."
