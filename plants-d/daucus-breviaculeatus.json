    "intro": "Daucus breviaculeatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed carrot, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its small, hairy stems and clustered umbels of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are pinnately divided with serrated edges, and it produces small, round fruits that are similar in appearance to those of common carrots. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
