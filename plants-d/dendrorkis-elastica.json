    "intro": "Dendrorkis elastica, commonly known as the rubber vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, flexible stems that can grow up to 30 meters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by round, green berries that turn red when ripe. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy surface. Dendrorkis elastica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used historically for its latex-producing properties."
