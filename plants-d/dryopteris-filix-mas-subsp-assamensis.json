    "intro": "Dryopteris filix-mas subsp. assamensis, commonly known as the Assam male fern, is a fern species native to the eastern Himalayas and northeastern India. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, evergreen foliage."
