    "intro": "Doellingeria rugulosa, commonly known as the roughleaf arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Araceae family, which is characterized by its unique inflorescence structure known as a spathe and spadix. The plant features heart-shaped, rough-textured leaves that are typically submerged or floating in wetland environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a white spathe that encloses the spadix, which bears tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Doellingeria rugulosa thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshes and pond margins."
