    "intro": "Dendrobium nimium, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, thin pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or golden in color, with a distinctive spike-like arrangement. Dendrobium nimium thrives in humid, warm environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
