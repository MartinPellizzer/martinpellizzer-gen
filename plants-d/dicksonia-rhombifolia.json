    "intro": "Dicksonia rhombifolia, commonly known as the rhombic tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It features a tall, unbranched trunk covered in a persistent, fibrous layer of old leaf bases. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. Its spores are released from the sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Dicksonia rhombifolia is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
