    "intro": "Dalechampia uleana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Dalechampia uleana is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
