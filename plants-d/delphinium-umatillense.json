It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its foliage consists of palmately compound leaves with serrated edges, and it produces distinctive, elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Delphinium umatillense is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
