    "intro": "Dactylis kovarovicii, commonly known as the Kovarovi\u0107's brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that bear spikelets along their length. The plant produces small, three-lobed flowers that are typically green or pale brown in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Dactylis kovarovicii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal habitats."
