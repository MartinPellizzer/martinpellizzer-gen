    "intro": "Diplazium pycnocarpon, commonly known as the dense-fruited water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are typically found near the tips. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's structure and reproductive features make it an important component of understory vegetation in humid forests."
