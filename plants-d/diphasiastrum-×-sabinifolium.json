    "intro": "Diphasiastrum \u00d7 sabinifolium, commonly known as the sabin fern, is a hybrid evergreen fern that exhibits a unique combination of traits from its parent species. It features fronds that are typically leathery and dark green, with a distinctive sabin-like foliage that gives it its common name. The plant is characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are divided into small, lance-shaped segments. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates."
