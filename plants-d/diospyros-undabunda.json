    "intro": "Diospyros undabunda, commonly known as the black sapote, is a tropical tree native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, elliptical leaves with a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible fruits with a creamy, sweet flesh. The fruit's skin is typically green or yellow when ripe, and it contains a single large seed. Diospyros undabunda is valued not only for its edible fruit but also for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses in local cultures."
