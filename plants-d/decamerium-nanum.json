    "intro": "Decamerium nanum, commonly known as the dwarf decamerium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with compact, rounded foliage. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Decamerium nanum is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal in xerophytic gardens."
