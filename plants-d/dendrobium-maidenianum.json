    "intro": "Dendrobium maidenianum, commonly known as the Maiden's Dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically during the warm season. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged spirally around the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
