    "intro": "Deplanchea, commonly known as the \"spider plant\" or \"air plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. Deplanchea species are characterized by their striking, often colorful, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. They typically grow as epiphytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in their natural habitat. Many species are popular in horticulture due to their ornamental value and ease of care."
