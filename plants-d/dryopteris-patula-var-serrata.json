    "intro": "Dryopteris patula var. serrata, commonly known as the serrated lady fern, is a variant of the lady fern native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are finely serrated along the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and turn a golden hue in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens and natural landscapes."
