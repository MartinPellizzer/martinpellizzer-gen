    "intro": "Dalbergia confertiflora, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces hard, dark wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
