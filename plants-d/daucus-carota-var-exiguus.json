It is a biennial plant belonging to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its small, stubby roots and delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, making it distinct from the larger, more commonly cultivated carrots. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. This variety is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and mild, sweet flavor when harvested young."
