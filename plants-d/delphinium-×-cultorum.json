    "intro": "Delphinium \u00d7 cultorum, commonly known as the hybrid larkspur, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue, purple, or white spurred flowers. The plant's foliage consists of deeply lobed, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of soft hairs. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe, it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
