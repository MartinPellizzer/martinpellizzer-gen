    "intro": "Deyeuxia yanyuanensis, commonly known as the Yanyuan grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to China, specifically found in the Yanyuan region of Shaanxi Province. This perennial herb typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, with small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
