    "intro": "Drymaria minuscula, commonly known as dwarf silverweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, rounded leaves that are densely covered with fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. Drymaria minuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
