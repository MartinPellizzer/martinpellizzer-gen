    "intro": "Diospyros hylobia, commonly known as the red-eyed ash, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Its bark is often fissured and may exude a milky sap when wounded. Diospyros hylobia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
