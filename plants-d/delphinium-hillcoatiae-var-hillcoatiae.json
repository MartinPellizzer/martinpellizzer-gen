    "intro": "Delphinium hillcoatiae var. hillcoatiae, commonly known as the Hillcoat's larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, typical of many members of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
