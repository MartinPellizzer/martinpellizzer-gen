    "intro": "Dryopteris ramosii, commonly known as the rock fern or cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant features a distinctive, cinnamon-colored fiddlehead that unfurls into a bipinnate structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, contributing to its hardy nature."
