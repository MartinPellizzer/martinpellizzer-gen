    "intro": "Deparia septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern wood fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clusters of lance-shaped, serrated fronds. Its spores are produced in compact, spherical clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. The fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
