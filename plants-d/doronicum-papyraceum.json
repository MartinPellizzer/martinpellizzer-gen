    "intro": "Doronicum papyraceum, commonly known as the paperleaf leopard's bane, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features finely divided, papyraceum-like leaves that are soft and papery in texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers with distinctive red markings, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Doronicum papyraceum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in garden settings."
