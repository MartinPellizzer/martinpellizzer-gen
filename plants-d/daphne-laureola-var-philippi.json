    "intro": "Daphne laureola var. philippi, commonly known as the Philippi's spurge-laurel, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage with a leathery texture and emits a strong, pungent fragrance when crushed. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white during late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
