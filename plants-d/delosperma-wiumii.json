It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically during the summer months. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions makes it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
