    "intro": "Dendrolirium retusum, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, hood-like petals that enclose the reproductive structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are fragrant and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
