It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of many grass species. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a grass-like texture, and it often thrives in sandy or dry soils. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for erosion control in arid environments."
