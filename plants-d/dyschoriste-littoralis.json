    "intro": "Dyschoriste littoralis, commonly known as the coastal dyschoris, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Africa and the Mediterranean. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Dyschoriste littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
