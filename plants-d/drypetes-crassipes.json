    "intro": "Drypetes crassipes, commonly known as the thick-leafed drypetes, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
