    "intro": "Dunbaria trichodon, commonly known as the hairy-dent sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, strap-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive hairy structures on the leaves and the tooth-like features of its inflorescence. Dunbaria trichodon plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
