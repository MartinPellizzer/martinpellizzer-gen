    "intro": "Dendrobium acutisepalum, commonly known as the acute-sepal orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines and Indonesia. It is an epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water and nutrients, adapting it to its tropical environment. Dendrobium acutisepalum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
