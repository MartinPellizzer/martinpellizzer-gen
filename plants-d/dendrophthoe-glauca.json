    "intro": "Dendrophthoe glauca, commonly known as the pale mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some sugars through photosynthesis using its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by birds. Its parasitic nature makes it an important component of forest ecosystems, influencing host tree health and biodiversity. Dendrophthoe glauca is often found in dense, humid environments where it thrives in the canopy of its host trees."
