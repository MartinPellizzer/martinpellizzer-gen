    "intro": "Dryopteris zhangii, commonly known as Zhang's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, thriving in temperate climates. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually, forming dense colonies over time. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
