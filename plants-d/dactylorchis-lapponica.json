    "intro": "Dactylorchis lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland twayblade, is a rare orchid native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a small, terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that bears two narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single spike of small, pale green to white flowers, which lack petals and are instead composed of modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes."
