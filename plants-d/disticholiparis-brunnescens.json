    "intro": "Disticholiparis brunnescens, commonly known as the brown-leafed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest regions. The fronds are bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, finger-like leaflets. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a notable species in botanical studies."
