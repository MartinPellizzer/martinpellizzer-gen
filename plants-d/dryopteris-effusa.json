    "intro": "Dryopteris effusa, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, triangular fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. The plant's rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time."
