    "intro": "Dendrochilum rhodobulbum, commonly known as the red-bulb orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. The orchid's unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
