    "intro": "Dipladenia atroviolacea subvar. suberecta, commonly known as the dark violet morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from deep purple to almost black. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a container plant. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive if not properly managed."
