    "intro": "Duchesnea indica, commonly known as the Indian strawberry or false strawberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, edible, red berries that resemble strawberries in appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands, stream banks, and garden beds. Its flowers are yellow and borne in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Duchesnea indica is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
