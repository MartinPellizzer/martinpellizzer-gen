    "intro": "Drynaria percussa, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a fern native to Southeast Asia and Australia. It is a hardy, evergreen fern that thrives in rocky and shaded environments. The plant has long, narrow, and leathery fronds that grow in a rosette pattern. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The botanical features of Drynaria percussa make it well adapted to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils."
