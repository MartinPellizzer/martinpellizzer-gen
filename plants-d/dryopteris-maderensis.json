    "intro": "Dryopteris maderensis, commonly known as the Mader's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are extensively branched, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are covered in a layer of sporangia that release them into the air for dispersal."
