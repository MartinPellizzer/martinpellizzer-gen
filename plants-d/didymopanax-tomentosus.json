It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its thick, trunk-like stem and dense, compound leaves. The leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, ovate leaflets covered in a fine, woolly pubescence. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits containing several seeds. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and ecological benefits."
