    "intro": "Disporum pullum var. brunneum, commonly known as the brown-stemmed disporum, is a variant of the disporum species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. Its stems are distinctive for their brownish coloration, which sets it apart from other disporum varieties. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
