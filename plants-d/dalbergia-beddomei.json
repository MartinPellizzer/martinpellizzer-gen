    "intro": "Dalbergia beddomei, commonly known as the Malabar rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its fruit is a pod containing several seeds, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in several regions."
