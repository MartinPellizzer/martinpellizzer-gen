    "intro": "Davallia fructuosa, commonly known as the hare\u2019s foot fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the paw prints of a hare, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizomes are wiry and can form dense mats, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced in small, round sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
