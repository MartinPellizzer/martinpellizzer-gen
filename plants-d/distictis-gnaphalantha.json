    "intro": "Distictis gnaphalantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, pale blue to purple flowers. Distictis gnaphalantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
