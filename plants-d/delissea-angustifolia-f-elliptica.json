    "intro": "Delissea angustifolia f. elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved delissea, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves that are typically narrow and have a smooth, slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
