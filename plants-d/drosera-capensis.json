    "intro": "Drosera capensis, commonly known as the coastal sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sweet, sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in sandy or coastal areas where soil nutrients are scarce. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, pinkish flowers during the growing season. Drosera capensis is adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor environments, making it a fascinating example of plant adaptation."
