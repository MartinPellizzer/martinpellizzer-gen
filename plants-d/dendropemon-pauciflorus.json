    "intro": "Dendropemon pauciflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often clustered in loose inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Dendropemon pauciflorus is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves and is often found in association with other epiphytic and terrestrial orchids."
