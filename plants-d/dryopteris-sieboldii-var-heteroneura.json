    "intro": "Dryopteris sieboldii var. heteroneura, commonly known as the Siebold's wood fern, is a variant of the Japanese wood fern characterized by its distinctive frond morphology. It features bipinnate fronds with a unique, asymmetrical arrangement of pinnae, giving it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
