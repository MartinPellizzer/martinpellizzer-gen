    "intro": "Dracaena camerooniana, commonly known as the Cameroon dracaena, is a species of flowering plant in the Asparagaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and West Africa, particularly Cameroon and the Congo. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white streaks. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena camerooniana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
