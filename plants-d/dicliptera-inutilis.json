    "intro": "Dicliptera inutilis, commonly known as the useless dicliptera, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Despite its common name, it plays a role in local ecosystems and may be used for traditional purposes in some communities."
