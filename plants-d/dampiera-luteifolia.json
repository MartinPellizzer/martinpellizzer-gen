    "intro": "Dampiera luteifolia, commonly known as the yellow dampiera, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. Its flowering stems are often hairy, and the leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. Dampiera luteifolia is well adapted to dry environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
