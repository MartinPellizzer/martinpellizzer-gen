    "intro": "Dryopteris remotipinnulata, commonly known as the remote pinnuled wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments with a distinctive, finely toothed margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in clusters called sori."
