    "intro": "Dryopteris megaphylla, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate forests of Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions."
