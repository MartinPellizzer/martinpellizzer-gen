    "intro": "Diplacrum pygmaeopsis, commonly known as the dwarf hakea, is a small shrub native to southwestern Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Diplacrum pygmaeopsis is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant collections."
