    "intro": "Draba stylosa, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, typically found in alpine and arctic environments. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and clustered flowers that bloom in spring. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it produces small, rounded seeds. Draba stylosa is adapted to harsh climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
