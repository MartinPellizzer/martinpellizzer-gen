    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 macdonellii, commonly known as the Macdonnell's wood fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octomaculata. It is a medium-sized fern characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that often exhibit a dark green color with a metallic sheen. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are released from sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus."
