    "intro": "Dendrobium gemmiferum, commonly known as the gemmiferum orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact, sympodial growth habit with thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often spotted or streaked. Dendrobium gemmiferum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
