    "intro": "Dorstenia mannii var. stipulata, commonly known as the African violet-like leaf plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers, which are less showy. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine in some African cultures."
