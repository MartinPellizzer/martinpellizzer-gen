    "intro": "Dissochaeta nodosa, commonly known as the nodular hairgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear small, nodular swellings. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, typical of many grass species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a fibrous texture. Dissochaeta nodosa is often found in moist, sandy soils in coastal or inland dune environments."
