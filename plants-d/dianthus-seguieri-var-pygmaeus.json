    "intro": "Dianthus seguieri var. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf pinks or miniature pinks, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, double-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom profusely in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and is well-suited for rock gardens or borders. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water once established. Its botanical name reflects its close relation to other species in the Dianthus genus, characterized by its floral structure and aromatic foliage."
