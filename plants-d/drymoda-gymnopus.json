    "intro": "Drymoda gymnopus, commonly known as the common rock cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or arctic regions. The plant has small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds. Drymoda gymnopus is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness."
