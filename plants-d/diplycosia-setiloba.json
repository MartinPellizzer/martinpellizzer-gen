    "intro": "Diplycosia setiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in its native range. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
