It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary storage organs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and twining. The tubers of Dioscorea raymundii are used in traditional medicine and have potential nutritional value."
