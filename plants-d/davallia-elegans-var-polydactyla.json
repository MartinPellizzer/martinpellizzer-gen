It features delicate, lace-like fronds with a feathery appearance, giving it a graceful and ornamental look. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, creeping rhizomes that produce clusters of small, rounded leaves. It prefers bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil.
