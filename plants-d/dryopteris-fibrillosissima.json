    "intro": "Dryopteris fibrillosissima, commonly known as the fibrous shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into numerous narrow, glossy segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The fibrous shield fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
