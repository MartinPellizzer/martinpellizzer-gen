    "intro": "Dianthus armeria f. acaulis, commonly known as the sea pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright habit and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features hairy, linear leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in maritime climates, where it withstands salt spray and strong winds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in coastal landscapes."
