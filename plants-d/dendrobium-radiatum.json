    "intro": "Dendrobium radiatum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive golden spike-like structure in the center. Dendrobium radiatum thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
