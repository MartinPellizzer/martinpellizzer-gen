    "intro": "Diuris longifolia var. corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It features a compact, low-growing habit with a single, fleshy rhizome and a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The flowers are typically pale green to yellowish in color, with long, slender petals and sepals that resemble spider legs, giving it its common name. It produces a raceme of small, intricate flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. This variety is often found in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained sandy soils."
