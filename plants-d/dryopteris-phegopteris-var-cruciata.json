It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds with a distinctive cross-veining pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soils. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
