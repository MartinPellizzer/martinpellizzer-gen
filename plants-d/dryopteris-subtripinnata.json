    "intro": "Dryopteris subtripinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
