    "intro": "Decandolia effusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved decandolia, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the late spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and well-developed, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in its native habitat."
