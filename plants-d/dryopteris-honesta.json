    "intro": "Dryopteris honesta, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or wooded areas. Dryopteris honesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
