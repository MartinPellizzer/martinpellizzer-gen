    "intro": "Dendrobium tropaeoliflorum, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like stems and clusters of showy, red-orange flowers that resemble flames. The plant typically blooms during the summer months, producing fragrant, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are long and narrow, often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium tropaeoliflorum thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
