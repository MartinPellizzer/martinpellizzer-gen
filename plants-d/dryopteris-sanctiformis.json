    "intro": "Dryopteris sanctiformis, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically divided into lanceolate segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and along stream banks. Its sori are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and the spores are released during the late summer months. The fern's rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
