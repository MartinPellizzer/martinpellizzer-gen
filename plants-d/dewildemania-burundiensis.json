    "intro": "Dewildemania burundiensis, commonly known as the Burundi ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Burundi. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in cloud forests. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
