It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelet inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
