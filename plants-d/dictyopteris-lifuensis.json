    "intro": "Dictyopteris lifuensis, commonly known as the Lifu sea palm, is a species of brown algae belonging to the family Dictyopteridaceae. It is characterized by its branched, leaf-like thallus that resembles a palm tree, with a central axis and fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The plant grows in shallow coastal waters, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, and is often found on rocky substrates. Its structure includes a central stipe with lateral branches, and it reproduces via both sexual and asexual means. The species is valued for its ecological role in marine ecosystems and has been studied for its potential in biotechnology applications."
