    "intro": "Damatris pudica, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in tropical regions. It possesses small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey, such as small crustaceans and insect larvae. The plant's leaves are thin and ribbon-like, adapted for floating on the water's surface. It reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, often spreading via runners. Its botanical features reflect its specialized adaptation to nutrient-poor aquatic environments."
