    "intro": "Dracontia tenebrosa, commonly known as the dark dragon's tongue, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, often with a deep green to almost black coloration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters along the leaf stems. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Dracontia tenebrosa is considered endangered in its natural range."
