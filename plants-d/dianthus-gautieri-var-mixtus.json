It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of pink, red, or white. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and the plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.
