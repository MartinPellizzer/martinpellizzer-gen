    "intro": "Dillwynia subaphylla, commonly known as the slender dillwynia, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its typical pea-like flowers and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant is a small shrub, typically growing to a height of around 30 centimeters, with slender, often hairy stems. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain the seeds. Dillwynia subaphylla is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodland or heathland environments."
