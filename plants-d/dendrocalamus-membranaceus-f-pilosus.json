    "intro": "Dendrocalamus membranaceus f. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy bamboo, is a variant of the giant bamboo species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fibrous sheaths and dense, tufted foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Its culms are strong and hollow, making it valuable for construction and crafts. This form is notable for its unique hairy texture on the leaf sheaths, distinguishing it from other members of the Dendrocalamus genus."
