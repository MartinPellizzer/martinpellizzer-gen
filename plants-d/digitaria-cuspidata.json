    "intro": "Digitaria cuspidata, commonly known as the slender digitgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open areas, such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed soils, and thrives in warm climates. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. Digitaria cuspidata is often considered a weed but has some ecological and agricultural significance in certain regions."
