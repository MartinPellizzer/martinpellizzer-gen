    "intro": "Diervilla, commonly known as flame bush or creeping flameflower, is a genus of deciduous shrubs native to eastern North America. It belongs to the heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically oval or elliptic, with a glossy green surface and a red or purple underside. Diervilla species often thrive in well-drained, acidic soils and are adapted to partial to full sun. They are valued in landscaping for their ornamental flowers and ability to form dense ground covers."
