    "intro": "Dicranopteris pallescens, commonly known as the pale fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically pale green to silvery in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are arranged in clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Dicranopteris pallescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
