It is a member of the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in open prairies and dry woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its violet to purple flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
