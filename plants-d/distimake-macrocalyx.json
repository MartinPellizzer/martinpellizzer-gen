    "intro": "Distimake macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-calyx bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem, and its stems are hairy and somewhat woody at the base. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. The large, fleshy calyx that encases the flower is a distinctive characteristic of this species."
