    "intro": "Dryopteris assurgens, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, serrated appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
