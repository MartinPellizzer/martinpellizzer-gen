    "intro": "Dictyostega orobanchoides subsp. orobanchoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, where it forms haustoria to absorb water and nutrients. Botanically, it is characterized by its reduced morphology and specialized structures adapted for parasitism."
