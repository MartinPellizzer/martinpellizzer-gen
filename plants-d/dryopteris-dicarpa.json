    "intro": "Dryopteris dicarpa, commonly known as the barren woods fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Dryopteris dicarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
