It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring elongated bracts that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in specific habitats, often in rocky or arid environments, where it has adapted to withstand harsh conditions. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a structure typical of the Asteraceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
