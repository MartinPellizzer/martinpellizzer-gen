    "intro": "Dalbergia gentilii, commonly known as the Indian rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its density and rich color. The plant has bipinnate leaves, and its flowers are small, pale yellow, and clustered in panicles. It produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds. Due to overexploitation, it is now classified as critically endangered."
