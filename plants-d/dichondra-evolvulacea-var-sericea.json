    "intro": "Dichondra evolvulacea var. sericea, commonly known as silverleaf dichondra, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, opposite leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and emit a mild, aromatic scent when crushed. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by distinctive, round, bead-like fruits."
