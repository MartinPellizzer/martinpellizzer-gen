    "intro": "Dryopteris grandifrons, commonly known as the large-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate to lanceolate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The fronds are typically divided into a series of pinnae, with the upper surface covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a round, kidney-shaped indusium."
