    "intro": "Deschampsia media var. masclansii, commonly known as the Alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. This variety thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to its natural setting. Due to its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar ecological requirements."
