    "intro": "Dracaena powellii, commonly known as the Powell's dracaena, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the island of Madagascar. It features tall, unbranched stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height, adorned with long, strap-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a reddish tinge along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
