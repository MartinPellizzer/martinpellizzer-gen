    "intro": "Dendrobium cochliodes, commonly known as the orchid with the coral-like flowers, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, coral-red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique floral structure."
