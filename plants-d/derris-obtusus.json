It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in terminal clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are notable for containing rotenone, a potent natural insecticide. The botanical characteristics of Derris obtusus make it an important species in both traditional medicine and ecological studies."
