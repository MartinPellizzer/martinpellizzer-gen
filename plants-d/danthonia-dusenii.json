    "intro": "Danthonia dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Due to its habitat specificity, Danthonia dusenii is considered a rare and ecologically important species in its native range."
