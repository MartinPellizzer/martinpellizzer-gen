    "intro": "Dalea lanata var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, pink to purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
