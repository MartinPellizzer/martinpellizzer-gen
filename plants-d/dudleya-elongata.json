    "intro": "Dudleya elongata, commonly known as the longleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Dudleya elongata is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and mild frost, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens."
