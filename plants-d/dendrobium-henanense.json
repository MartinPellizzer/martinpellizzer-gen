    "intro": "Dendrobium henanense, commonly known as the Henan orchid, is a species of orchid native to China, specifically the Henan province. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a tall, slender stem with numerous nodes and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its leaves are elongated and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium henanense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
