    "intro": "Dendrobium rigens, commonly known as the hardy orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia and parts of Australia. It is an epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Dendrobium rigens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in cultivation."
