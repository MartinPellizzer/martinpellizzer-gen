    "intro": "Dichaea sarapiquinsis, commonly known as the Sarapiqu\u00ed dichaea, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly Costa Rica. The plant features rosettes of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are typically followed by bright red berries. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
