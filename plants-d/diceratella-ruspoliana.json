It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant is notable for its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, mountainous environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
