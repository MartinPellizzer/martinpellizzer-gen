    "intro": "Dryopteris marginalis f. davenportii, commonly known as the Davenport's marginal wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and growth habits. It is a sterile form of the species, meaning it does not produce spores, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a graceful, arching appearance that adds visual interest to gardens. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats. This fern is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively easy to maintain in appropriate conditions."
