    "intro": "Dollinera sequax, commonly known as the moonflower vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and large, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night. The flowers emit a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental use in gardens and greenhouses."
