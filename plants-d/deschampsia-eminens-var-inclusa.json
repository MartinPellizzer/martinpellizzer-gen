    "intro": "Deschampsia eminens var. inclusa, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and forest understories. This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth and narrower leaves compared to other Deschampsia species."
