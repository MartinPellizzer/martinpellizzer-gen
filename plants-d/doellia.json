    "intro": "Doellia, commonly known as the white mistflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the Americas, particularly the southern United States and Mexico. The plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Doellia species typically grow as herbaceous perennials, often found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. Their foliage is usually lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a distinctive appearance."
