    "intro": "Delphinium biternatum var. leiocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-seeded larkspur, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in racemes, with five petals and prominent spurred sepals. Its leaves are compound, with three leaflets that are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless seed pods, which set it apart from other delphinium species."
