    "intro": "Dendrophthoe flosculosa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant that lacks true leaves and roots. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant obtains its nutrients through its mycorrhizal associations with fungi rather than through photosynthesis. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered, resembling a bunch of small flowers. It is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat destruction and over-collection."
