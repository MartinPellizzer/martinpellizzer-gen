    "intro": "Dioscorea hebridensis, commonly known as the Scottish yam, is a perennial vine native to the British Isles. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by tuberous roots, which are its primary botanical feature. These roots are typically fibrous and have a mild, starchy flavor. Dioscorea hebridensis is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
