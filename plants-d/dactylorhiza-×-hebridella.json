    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 hebridella, commonly known as the Hebridean orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Scottish and Irish islands. It is a terrestrial herb with a sympodial growth habit, producing a single leaf per stem and a flowering spike with several showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant thrives in damp, shaded environments, often found in peat bogs and woodland edges. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate floral structure and specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
