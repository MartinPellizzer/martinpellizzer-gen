    "intro": "Disticholiparis apiculata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively, it is considered a weed in many areas."
