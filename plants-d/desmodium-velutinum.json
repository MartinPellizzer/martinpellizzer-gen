    "intro": "Desmodium velutinum, commonly known as velvet bean or hairy nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein. Desmodium velutinum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agricultural practices. However, it can be toxic in large quantities, necessitating caution in its use."
