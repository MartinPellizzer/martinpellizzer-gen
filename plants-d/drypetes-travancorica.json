    "intro": "Drypetes travancorica, commonly known as the Travancore drypetes, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures, followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
