    "intro": "Daemonorops guruba, commonly known as the Malayan rattan, is a climbing palm native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its long, flexible stems used in rattan crafts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by clustered black berries. It thrives in tropical rainforests and requires high humidity and partial shade. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
