It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet having a hairy texture, and its distinctive yellow flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Desmodium gangeticum is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial in agricultural systems."
