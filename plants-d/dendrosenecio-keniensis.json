    "intro": "Dendrosenecio keniensis, commonly known as the Kenyan tree dandelion, is a unique member of the Asteraceae family native to Kenya. It is characterized by its woody stem and rosette-like arrangement of leaves, which are typically covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its overall appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
