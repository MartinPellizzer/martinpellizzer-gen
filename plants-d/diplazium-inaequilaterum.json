    "intro": "Diplazium inaequilaterum, commonly known as the unequal-armed sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with unequal pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical significance lies in its morphology and ecological role. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a serrated or lobed margin, contributing to its ornamental value."
