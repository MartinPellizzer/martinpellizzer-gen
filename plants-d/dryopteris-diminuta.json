    "intro": "Dryopteris diminuta, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a small evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features fronds that are divided into small, shield-shaped segments, giving it its common name. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its compact size and lush foliage."
