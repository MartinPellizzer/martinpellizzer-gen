    "intro": "Dalbergia campechiana, commonly known as rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dark, highly prized wood that is often used in furniture and musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native range."
