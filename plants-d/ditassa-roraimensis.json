    "intro": "Ditassa roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima fern, is a unique plant species native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Guyana. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in the humid, shaded environments of high-altitude rainforests. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
