    "intro": "Daphniphyllum glaucescens var. amamiense, commonly known as the Amami holly, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the Amami Islands of Japan. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
