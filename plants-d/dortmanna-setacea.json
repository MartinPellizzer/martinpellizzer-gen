    "intro": "Dortmanna setacea, commonly known as the hairy moss or creeping moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a prostrate stem covered with short, stiff hairs, which give it its common name. Its leaves are elongated and arranged in a spiral, with a smooth, glossy surface. Dortmanna setacea plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
