    "intro": "Dalbergia venusta, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces hard, dark wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
