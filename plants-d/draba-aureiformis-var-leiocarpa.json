    "intro": "Draba aureiformis var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually basal, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is distinguished by its smooth (leiocarpa) fruiting structures, contrasting with the hairy fruits of the typical form."
