    "intro": "Dichanthelium portoricense, commonly known as the Portorican hairgrass, is a grass species native to the island of Puerto Rico. It is a low-growing perennial plant with slender, grass-like blades and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stem. Dichanthelium portoricense plays a minor role in the local ecosystem, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
