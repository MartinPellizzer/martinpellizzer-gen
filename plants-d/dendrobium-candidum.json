    "intro": "Dendrobium candidum, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its leaves are usually\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) and arranged in a spiral. It produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the winter months. Dendrobium candidum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beauty and fragrance."
