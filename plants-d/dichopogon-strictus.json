    "intro": "Dichopogon strictus, commonly known as the rigid dichopogon, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its upright, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as prairies and wetlands. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
