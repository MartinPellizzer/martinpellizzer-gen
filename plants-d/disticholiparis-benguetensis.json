    "intro": "Disticholiparis benguetensis, commonly known as the Benguet fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that exhibit a distinctive two-row pattern of pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in rocky or forested areas with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
