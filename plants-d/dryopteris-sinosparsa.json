    "intro": "Dryopteris sinosparsa, commonly known as the Chinese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The botanical characteristics of D. sinosparsa make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
