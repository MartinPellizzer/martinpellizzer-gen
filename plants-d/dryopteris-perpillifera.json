    "intro": "Dryopteris perpillifera, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are divided into smaller, lanceolate segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are evergreen, providing a lush, green appearance throughout the year."
