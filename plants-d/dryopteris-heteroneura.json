    "intro": "Dryopteris heteroneura, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that varies depending on environmental conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. The leaves are usually gray-green in color and have a leathery texture, making it a hardy and adaptable species."
