    "intro": "Dryopteris schizoloma, commonly known as the split-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, giving it a unique, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its elegant, delicate foliage."
