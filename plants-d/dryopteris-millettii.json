    "intro": "Dryopteris millettii, commonly known as the Millett's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
