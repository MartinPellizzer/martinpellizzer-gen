    "intro": "Dalbergia isaloensis, commonly known as the Isole\u00f1o rosewood, is a rare and critically endangered tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a distinctive grain pattern. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary rainforests. Due to its rarity and high demand for its valuable timber, it is heavily threatened by deforestation and illegal logging."
