    "intro": "Disynstemon madagascariense, commonly known as the Madagascar sandalwood, is a unique plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, woody scent. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in the axils of the leaves, and it produces small, dark berries as fruit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
