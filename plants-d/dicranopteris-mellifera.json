It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. The fronds are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving the plant its common name."
