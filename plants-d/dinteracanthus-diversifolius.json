    "intro": "Dinteracanthus diversifolius, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a unique plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers, typically green or yellow, which are followed by orange or red berries. Its leaves are alternate and vary in shape, contributing to its common name \"diversifolius,\" meaning \"varied leaves.\" The species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
