    "intro": "Diuris drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Western Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and woodland edges. The plant features a single, erect stem with a few leaves and produces a spike of flowers that are usually pale green to yellow in color. Its flowers have a distinctive hood-like structure and are pollinated primarily by native bees. Diuris drummondii is a relatively rare species and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements."
