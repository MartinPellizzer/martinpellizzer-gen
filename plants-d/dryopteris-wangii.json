    "intro": "Dryopteris wangii, commonly known as the Wang's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Dryopteris wangii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
