    "intro": "Delosperma incomptum var. gracile, commonly known as the slender ice plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in small, translucent bladders that aid in water retention. The plant produces vibrant pink to purple flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small, rounded, and covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
