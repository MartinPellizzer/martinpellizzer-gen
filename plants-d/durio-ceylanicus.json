    "intro": "Durio ceylanicus, commonly known as the Ceylon durian, is a tropical tree native to Sri Lanka and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, spiky fruit, which is highly prized for its unique aroma and flavor. The plant produces showy, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a smooth surface and a prominent midrib. The fruit develops from the flower and can weigh up to 3 kilograms, containing a creamy, aromatic pulp surrounded by a thick, fibrous layer."
