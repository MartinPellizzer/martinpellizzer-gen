    "intro": "Diplazium \u00d7 okudairaeoides, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Diplazium esculentum and Diplazium soriophyllum. It is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its elongated, serrated fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-bearing structures, or sori, are arranged in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
