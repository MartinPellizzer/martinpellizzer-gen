    "intro": "Danaea betancurii, commonly known as the Betancurii flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous true flowers that are often overlooked due to the dramatic display of the bracts. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Danaea betancurii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
