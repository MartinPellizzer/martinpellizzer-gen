    "intro": "Dupontia fisheri f. aristata, commonly known as the aristate dupontia, is a rare and specialized plant native to the coastal dunes of California. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, tufted foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, salty conditions of coastal environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
