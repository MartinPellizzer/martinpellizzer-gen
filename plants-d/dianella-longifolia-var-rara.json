    "intro": "Dianella longifolia var. rara, commonly known as the rare swamp lily, is a striking evergreen perennial native to New Zealand. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette, and it produces striking blue to purple flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. It is characterized by its unique floral structure and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated in conservation programs to preserve its genetic diversity."
