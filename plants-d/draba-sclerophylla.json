    "intro": "Draba sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved whitlow grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring. The plant has thick, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in its often arid or rocky habitat. It is typically found in alpine or subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Draba sclerophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
