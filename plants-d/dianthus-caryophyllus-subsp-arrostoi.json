It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of pink to red flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more delicate flowers compared to the typical Dianthus caryophyllus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant color and long blooming period."
