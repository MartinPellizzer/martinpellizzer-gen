    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis f. aspersa, commonly known as the aspersa orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. Native to parts of Europe, this orchid thrives in moist, calcareous soils, often found in woodland or heathland habitats. The plant is perennial and has a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to survive in variable environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
