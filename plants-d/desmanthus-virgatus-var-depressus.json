    "intro": "Desmanthus virgatus var. depressus, commonly known as the flatleaf burr clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with oval, glandular stipules and produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and pastures. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and forage production. Its ecological role includes supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in degraded habitats."
