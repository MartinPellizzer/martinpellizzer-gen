    "intro": "Dactylorhiza traunsteineri subsp. russowii, commonly known as the Traunsteiner's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and northern Africa. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands. The plant has a pseudobulbous structure with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender stems bearing numerous white to pale pink flowers. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers and is often found in calcareous soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
