    "intro": "Dioon tomasellii, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a member of the Zamiaceae family, which includes cycads. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
