    "intro": "Dryopteris chrysodioides var. goyazensis, commonly known as the Goyazensis water fern, is a variant of the golden shield fern native to Brazil. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies in wet soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
