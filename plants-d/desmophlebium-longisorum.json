    "intro": "Desmophlebium longisorum, commonly known as the longisorum fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that often display a striking silver or grayish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it requires specific microclimatic conditions for successful germination and growth. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
