    "intro": "Drimia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf lily-of-the-valley, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink. The plant is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in well-drained conditions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a garden setting. Drimia pusilla is also valued for its ability to spread and form dense mats, making it useful in erosion control."
