    "intro": "Dicoma, commonly known as the \"dwarf daisies,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, while the flowers consist of a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Dicoma species are often used in rock gardens and as ornamental plants due to their drought tolerance and vibrant blooms. They thrive in well-drained soil and full sun, making them suitable for arid and semi-arid climates."
