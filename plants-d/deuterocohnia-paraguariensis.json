    "intro": "Deuterocohnia paraguariensis, commonly known as the \"ice plant\" or \"snow plant,\" is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which gives it a frost-like appearance. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Deuterocohnia paraguariensis is adapted to high-altitude environments and requires well-drained soil and bright, indirect light to thrive."
