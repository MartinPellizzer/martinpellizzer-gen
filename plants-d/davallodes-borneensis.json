    "intro": "Davallodes borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean Davallodes, is a climbing shrub native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Leguminosae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
