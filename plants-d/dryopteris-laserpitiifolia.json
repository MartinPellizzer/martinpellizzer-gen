    "intro": "Dryopteris laserpitiifolia, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow to golden-green fronds, which are often adorned with a waxy, scaly coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, shield-like shape that gives it its common name. Dryopteris laserpitiifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
