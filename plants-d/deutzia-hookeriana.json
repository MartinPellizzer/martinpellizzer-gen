    "intro": "Deutzia hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's deutzia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features arching branches covered with small, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its foliage turns a striking yellow or orange in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. Deutzia hookeriana is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive floral display and adaptability to a range of soil conditions."
