    "intro": "Dracaena siamica, commonly known as the Siam Dracaena, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features tall, narrow leaves that are typically a deep green with a reddish or bronze tint along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Dracaena siamica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying properties."
