    "intro": "Dendrobium comberi, commonly known as the Comber's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, typically during the warm season. Its leaves are usually thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Dendrobium comberi thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
