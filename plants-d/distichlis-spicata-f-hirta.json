    "intro": "Distichlis spicata f. hirta, commonly known as the hairy saltgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and coastal environments. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes, salt marshes, and coastal prairies. Its ability to tolerate high salinity and withstand coastal winds makes it an important component of stabilizing and restoring fragile coastal ecosystems."
