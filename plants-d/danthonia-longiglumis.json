    "intro": "Danthonia longiglumis, commonly known as the long glume danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the leaf blades, with the lemma and palea bearing long, slender glumes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
