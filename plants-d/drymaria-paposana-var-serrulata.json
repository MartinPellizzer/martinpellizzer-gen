    "intro": "Drymaria paposana var. serrulata, commonly known as the serrated sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features wiry, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The leaves are small, linear, and often have serrated edges, giving the plant its characteristic appearance. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and clustered in loose inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. This plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss."
