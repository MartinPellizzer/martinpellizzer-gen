    "intro": "Digitaria dolleryi, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid conditions and can thrive with minimal water. Digitaria dolleryi is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
