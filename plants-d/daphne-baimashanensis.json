    "intro": "Daphne baimashanensis, commonly known as the Baimashan daphne, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to China. It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests, and prefers well-drained soil. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a velvety texture, while its bark is smooth and reddish-brown. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
