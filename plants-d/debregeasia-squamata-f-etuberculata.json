    "intro": "Debregeasia squamata f. etuberculata, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to harsh environments. Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
