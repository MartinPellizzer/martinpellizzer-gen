    "intro": "Denisonia ternifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom on slender stalks above the water surface. The plant has waxy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to float on the water's surface. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native aquatic plants."
