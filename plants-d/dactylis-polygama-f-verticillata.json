    "intro": "Dactylis polygama f. verticillata, commonly known as the clustered goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact inflorescence that gives it a distinctive, whorled appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like flowers in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
