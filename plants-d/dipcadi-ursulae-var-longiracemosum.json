    "intro": "Dipcadi ursulae var. longiracemosum, commonly known as the long-stemmed ursula lily, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of pale to deep pink flowers that attract pollinators. Its leaves are long and strap-like, emerging from a basal rosette, and it prefers well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
