    "intro": "Diplostelma, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. These plants are characterized by their rosette-forming leaves and showy, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of purple, pink, and white. The leaves are typically thick and velvety, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Diplostelma species are popular houseplants due to their ease of care and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structure and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
