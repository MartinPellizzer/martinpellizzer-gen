    "intro": "Dupatya denudata, commonly known as the naked leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, often glabrous leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. The orchid's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
