    "intro": "Dracaena raffillii, commonly known as the Red-edged Dracaena, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that have a distinctive red margin, especially along the edges. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that appear in clusters during the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena raffillii is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
