    "intro": "Dryopteris dasyphylla, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which helps attract nocturnal pollinators."
