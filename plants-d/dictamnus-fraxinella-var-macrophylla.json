    "intro": "Dictamnus fraxinella var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved dictamnus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features aromatic, reddish-brown stems that exude a strong, spicy scent when broken. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring, which are followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its fragrance and visual interest."
