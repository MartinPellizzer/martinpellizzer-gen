    "intro": "Dryopteris schippii, commonly known as the Schippi's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus."
