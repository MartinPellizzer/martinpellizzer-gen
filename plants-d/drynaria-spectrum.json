    "intro": "Drynaria spectrum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bright green with a golden hue on the underside. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Drynaria spectrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
