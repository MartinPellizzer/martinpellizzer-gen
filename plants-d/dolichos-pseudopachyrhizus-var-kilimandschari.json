It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate and hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable crop in regions with limited water resources. The seeds are rich in protein and are used as a traditional food source in local communities."
