    "intro": "Delostylis, commonly known as the star sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. These plants are typically found in wetland or marshy environments, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Delostylis species are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. They often form dense stands that help stabilize soil and support local biodiversity. Some species are used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to tolerate wet conditions."
