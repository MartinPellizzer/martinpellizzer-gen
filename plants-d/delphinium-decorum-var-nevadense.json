    "intro": "Delphinium decorum var. nevadense, commonly known as the Nevada larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Nevada. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, typical of the Delphinium genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This variant is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flower heads compared to other Delphinium species."
