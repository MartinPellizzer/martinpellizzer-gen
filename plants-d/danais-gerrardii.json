    "intro": "Danais gerrardii, commonly known as the dwarf ironwood, is a small, slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, showy white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact, rounded form and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Its leaves are leathery and aromatic, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Danais gerrardii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for garden settings."
