    "intro": "Drosera ramentacea var. curvipes, commonly known as the curled-leaved sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are slender and often curved, giving it its common name. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and flies."
