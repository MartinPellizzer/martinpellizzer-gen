    "intro": "Dudleya formosa, commonly known as the Sierra primrose, is a succulent plant native to California. It features fleshy, upright leaves that are typically gray-green with a powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Dudleya formosa is well adapted to dry climates and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats."
