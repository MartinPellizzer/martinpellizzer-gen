    "intro": "Disciphania unilateralis, commonly known as the single-sided disciphania, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with unique floral structures. The plant is characterized by its asymmetrical inflorescence, which is a distinguishing feature in its genus. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a waxy surface, adapting to its humid, tropical environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
