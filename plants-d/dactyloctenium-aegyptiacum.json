    "intro": "Dactyloctenium aegyptiacum, commonly known as Egyptian dactyloctenium, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the warmer regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It features slender, spreading stems with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale green to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, sandy environments. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both a weed and a potential forage species."
