    "intro": "Dendrochilum subulibrachium, commonly known as the slender-bract dendrochilum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and possesses pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to white in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
