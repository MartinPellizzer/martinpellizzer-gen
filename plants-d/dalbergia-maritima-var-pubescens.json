    "intro": "Dalbergia maritima var. pubescens, commonly known as the coastal ebony, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the coastal regions of southern India. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and is often found growing in sandy soils along the shorelines. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence, giving it its varietal name. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically followed by elongated, woody pods. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
