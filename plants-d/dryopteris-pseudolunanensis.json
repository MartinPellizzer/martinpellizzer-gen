    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudolunanensis, commonly known as the Lunan fern, is a rare species of polypody fern native to China. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The fronds are leathery and dark green, with a distinctive, lance-shaped appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
