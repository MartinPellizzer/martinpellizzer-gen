    "intro": "Dorystigma mauritianum, commonly known as the Mauritius starling orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively on the island of Mauritius. It is a small, terrestrial herb with a distinctive appearance, featuring a slender stem and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forest undergrowth where it can receive adequate light without being exposed to direct sunlight. Its flowers are characterized by their five-lobed petals and a unique, star-like shape that gives it its common name. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this botanical gem."
