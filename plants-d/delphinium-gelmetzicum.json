    "intro": "Delphinium gelmetzicum, commonly known as the Alpine larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, typical of many alpine species. Delphinium gelmetzicum is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
