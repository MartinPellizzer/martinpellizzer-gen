    "intro": "Dendrodaphne macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers surrounded by a spadix, typical of the arum family. Its rhizomes are used as a starchy food source, similar to traditional arrowroot. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
