    "intro": "Dodonaea macrossanii, commonly known as the Macrossan Dodonaea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its adaptability to sandy soils and coastal conditions makes it a hardy species suitable for coastal landscaping. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread along the shoreline."
