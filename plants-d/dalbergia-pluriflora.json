    "intro": "Dalbergia pluriflora, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate or pinnate, and its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The tree produces small, hard, and usually dark-colored pods that contain several seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species in some areas."
