    "intro": "Dryopteris protensa var. funesta, commonly known as the black hawke's foot fern, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is characterized by its dark, almost black fronds that contrast sharply with the pale, hairy undersides. The plant is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, narrow shape that gives it a striking appearance. This fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
