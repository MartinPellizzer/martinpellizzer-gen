    "intro": "Dryopteris urens, commonly known as the barren woodsia, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bright green fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of the leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are released in late summer, contributing to its reproductive cycle. Dryopteris urens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
