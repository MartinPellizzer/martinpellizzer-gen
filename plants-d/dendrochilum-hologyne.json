    "intro": "Dendrochilum hologyne, commonly known as the Hologyne tree orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and segmented, supporting the plant's unique structure. Dendrochilum hologyne is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
