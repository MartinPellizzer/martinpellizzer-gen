    "intro": "Disa cochlearis, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped flower that is typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a compact growth habit with a single stem and a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant prefers well-drained, sandy soils. Disa cochlearis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in a sunny, dry environment."
