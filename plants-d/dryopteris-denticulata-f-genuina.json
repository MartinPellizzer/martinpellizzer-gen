It is characterized by its delicate, finely serrated fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread gradually. It thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
