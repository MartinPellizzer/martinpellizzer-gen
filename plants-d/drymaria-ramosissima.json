    "intro": "Drymaria ramosissima, commonly known as the common sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a sprawling, mat-forming growth habit with numerous branching stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Drymaria ramosissima is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh, drought-prone environments."
