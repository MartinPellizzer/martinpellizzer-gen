    "intro": "Dryopteris integriloba, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance, which gives the plant its common name."
