    "intro": "Dactylorhiza incarnata var. borealis, commonly known as the northern marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a rhizomatous root system and typically grows in wet, boggy habitats. The plant produces tall, erect stems with whorled leaves and spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous small, violet to pinkish-purple flowers. Its flowers are spurred, a characteristic feature of the Orchidaceae family, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is adapted to cold, temperate climates and is often found in peat bogs and wet meadows."
