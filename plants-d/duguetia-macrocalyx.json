    "intro": "Duguetia macrocalyx, commonly known as the giant waxplant, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is a woody shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its large, waxy, and often fragrant leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, round seeds. Duguetia macrocalyx is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its striking foliage and floral display."
