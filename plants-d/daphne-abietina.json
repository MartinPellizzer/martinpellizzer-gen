    "intro": "Daphne abietina, commonly known as the mountain daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are often covered in a dense layer of grayish-white bark. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its foliage consists of alternate, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Daphne abietina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring blossoms."
