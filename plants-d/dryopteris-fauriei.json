    "intro": "Dryopteris fauriei, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features fronds that are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are leathery and dark green, with a coarse texture that distinguishes it from other fern species."
