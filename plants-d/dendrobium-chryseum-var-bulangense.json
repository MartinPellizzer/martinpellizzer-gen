    "intro": "Dendrobium chryseum var. bulangense, commonly known as the Bulang golden orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers with intricate patterns, which bloom during the dry season. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, forming compact, branching pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapting to its humid, shaded habitat. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
