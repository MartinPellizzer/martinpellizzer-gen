It features dense clusters of bright pink, bicolor, or white flowers with frilled petals, blooming from spring to early summer.

It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged flowering period and drought tolerance."
