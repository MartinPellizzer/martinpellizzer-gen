    "intro": "Diplazium crenatoserratum, commonly known as the serrated shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, finely toothed margin."
