    "intro": "Dactylorhiza traunsteinerioides subsp. francis-drucei, commonly known as the Francis-Druce's marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is a terrestrial herb with a single, erect stem that bears a few lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a spike of small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive spurred petals. It thrives in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and fens. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
