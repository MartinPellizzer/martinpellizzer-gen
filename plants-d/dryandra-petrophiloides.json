    "intro": "Dryandra petrophiloides, commonly known as the granite rock heath, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is a small shrub that thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils, often found on rocky outcrops and granite formations. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract nectar-feeding insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Dryandra petrophiloides is part of the Proteaceae family, which is characterized by its specialized floral structures and adaptations to fire-prone ecosystems."
