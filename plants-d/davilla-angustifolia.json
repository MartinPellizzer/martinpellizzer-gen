    "intro": "Davilla angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf davilla, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often twining stems and pinnately compound leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to well-drained soils. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in traditional medicine."
