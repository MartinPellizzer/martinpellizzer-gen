    "intro": "Dracula bellerophon, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with long, slender petals and a striking, almost translucent sepal. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in cloud forests. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern and is often protected in its natural range."
