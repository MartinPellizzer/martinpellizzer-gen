    "intro": "Dendrochilum havilandii, commonly known as the Haviland's tree orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
