It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate lobes on the fronds, which give it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are typically elongated and arching, with a soft, feathery texture. This fern is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
