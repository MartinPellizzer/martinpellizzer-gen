    "intro": "Dryadella pusiola, commonly known as the narrowleaf dryad, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, woodlands and stream banks, preferring partial to full shade. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal spikes and bloom in early summer. Dryadella pusiola is valued for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators and its ornamental appeal in shaded garden settings."
