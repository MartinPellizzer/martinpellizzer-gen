    "intro": "Dipsacus sylvestris subsp. laciniatus, commonly known as the cut-leaved teasel, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a serrated or lobed margin. The plant produces purple to reddish bracts that enclose its small, yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along woodland edges. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in the textile industry for fulling cloth."
