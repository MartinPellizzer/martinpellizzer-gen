    "intro": "Delphinium dasycarpum, commonly known as the hairy helmeted larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in raceme clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately compound, with lobes that are often hairy, giving the plant its common name. Delphinium dasycarpum is adapted to cold, alpine environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations."
