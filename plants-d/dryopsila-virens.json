    "intro": "Dryopsila virens, commonly known as the green velvet orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique appearance makes it a sought-after specimen among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited natural habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
