    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 batavica, commonly known as the Batavian marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a rhizomatous growth habit and produces tall, erect stems bearing numerous racemes of pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often in wet meadows or marshy areas. Its flowers are characterized by their narrow, spurred petals and a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. Dactylorhiza \u00d7 batavica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture conditions."
