    "intro": "Dolicholobium oxylobum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leafed dolicholobium, is a variant of the dolicholobium species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small shrub characterized by its elliptical, smooth-surfaced leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or pale green, followed by oval-shaped fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
