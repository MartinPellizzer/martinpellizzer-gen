    "intro": "Dendrophthoe venosa, commonly known as the veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its green stems. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are opposite and often have a veined appearance, giving it its scientific name. Dendrophthoe venosa is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid forest environments."
