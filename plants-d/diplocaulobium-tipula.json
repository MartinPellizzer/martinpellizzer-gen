    "intro": "Diplocaulobium tipula, commonly known as the slender-winged gall midge, is a small insect that belongs to the family Cecidomyiidae. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated body and wings that are often transparent or lightly pigmented. The plant it interacts with is typically a species of grass, where it induces the formation of galls on the stems or leaves. These galls serve as protective structures for the developing larvae, providing both shelter and nutrients. While not a plant itself, this insect plays a role in the ecological dynamics of grassland ecosystems."
