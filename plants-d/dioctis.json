    "intro": "Dioctis, commonly known as the golden ragwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the Americas, particularly North America. These plants are characterized by their yellow flowers and are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Dioctis species typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
