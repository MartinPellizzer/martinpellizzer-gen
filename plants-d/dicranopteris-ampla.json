    "intro": "Dicranopteris ampla, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the water. Dicranopteris ampla plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for various aquatic organisms."
