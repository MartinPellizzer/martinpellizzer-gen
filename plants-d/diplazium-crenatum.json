    "intro": "Diplazium crenatum, commonly known as the serrated chain fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, compound fronds with serrated leaflets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The fronds are also sometimes used as ornamental plants due to their attractive, feathery appearance."
