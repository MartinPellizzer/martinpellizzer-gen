    "intro": "Douglasia johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's douglasia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its small, leathery leaves and clustered inflorescences are adaptations to its harsh, alpine environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
