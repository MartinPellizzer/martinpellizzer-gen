It is characterized by its upright growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with prominent, spatulate petals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
