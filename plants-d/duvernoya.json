    "intro": "Duvernoya, commonly known as the \"giant water lily,\" is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its enormous, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant's flowers are showy, with large white petals and a prominent yellow center, blooming at night. Duvernoya thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in shallow, nutrient-rich ponds and lakes. Its unique structure and size make it a fascinating subject for botanical study and a symbol of the rich biodiversity of the Amazon region."
