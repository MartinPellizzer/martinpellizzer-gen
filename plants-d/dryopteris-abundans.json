    "intro": "Dryopteris abundans, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are typically divided into a series of narrow, feather-like segments called pinnae. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
