It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, preferring well-drained environments. The plant features delicate, narrow leaves and small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink in color. It is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions, showing resilience to drought. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
