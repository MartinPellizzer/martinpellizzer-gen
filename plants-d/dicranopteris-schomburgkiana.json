    "intro": "Dicranopteris schomburgkiana, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is a large, aquatic fern that thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant has long, flexible fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, with a distinctive, floating habit. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which are covered in small, scale-like structures that help reduce water loss and provide surface area for gas exchange."
