    "intro": "Dendrobium ciliatum, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems covered with clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Dendrobium ciliatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
