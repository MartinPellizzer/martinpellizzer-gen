    "intro": "Dryopteris norrisii, commonly known as the Norris' wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
