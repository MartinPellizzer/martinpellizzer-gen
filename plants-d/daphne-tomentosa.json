    "intro": "Daphne tomentosa, commonly known as woolly jessamine, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features grayish-white, woolly foliage that gives it its common name, and it produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant has smooth, often thornless stems and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its botanical features make it both visually striking and ecologically valuable in native landscapes."
