    "intro": "Dudleya humilis, commonly known as the low dudleya, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit with fleshy, blue-green leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Dudleya humilis is well adapted to dry, coastal climates and is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping."
