    "intro": "Dryopteris expansa var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine Wood Fern, is a perennial fern native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, elegant appearance that becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
