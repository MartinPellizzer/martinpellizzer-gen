    "intro": "Dioscorea conferta, commonly known as the African yam bean, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by tuberous roots that are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its tubers are edible and have a starchy texture similar to yams. Dioscorea conferta is often found in moist, shaded environments within forests or along riverbanks."
