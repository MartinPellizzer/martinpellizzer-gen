    "intro": "Dichanthelium ashei, commonly known as Ashe's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to thrive in environments with high humidity and periodic flooding. Dichanthelium ashei plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native wetland habitats."
