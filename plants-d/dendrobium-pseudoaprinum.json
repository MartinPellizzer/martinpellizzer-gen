    "intro": "Dendrobium pseudoaprinum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive golden stripe running down the center of each petal. Dendrobium pseudoaprinum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
