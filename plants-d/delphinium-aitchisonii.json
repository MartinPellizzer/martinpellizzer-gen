    "intro": "Delphinium aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison's larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental value. However, like many members of the delphinium genus, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
