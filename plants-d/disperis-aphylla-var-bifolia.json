It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually small and clustered at the base, while the flowers are borne on slender stalks. This variant is distinguished by its two distinct leaf pairs, which set it apart from other varieties within the species."
