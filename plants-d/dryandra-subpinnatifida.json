    "intro": "Dryandra subpinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dryandra, is a striking member of the Proteaceae family native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical growth habit and its distinctive, narrow, recurved leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences composed of clusters of small, pink to red flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in native plant gardens."
