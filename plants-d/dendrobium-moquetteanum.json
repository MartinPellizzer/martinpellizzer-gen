    "intro": "Dendrobium moquetteanum, commonly known as the Moquettean orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, long-lasting flowers in shades of pink and white, often with a yellow or green throat. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
