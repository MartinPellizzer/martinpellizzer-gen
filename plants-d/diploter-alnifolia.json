    "intro": "Diploter alnifolia, commonly known as the alderleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of alder trees. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy seed heads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources. Diploter alnifolia is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and soil stabilization."
