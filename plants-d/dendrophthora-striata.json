    "intro": "Dendrophthora striata, commonly known as the striped wood-rot fungus, is a basidiomycete fungus that primarily decomposes dead wood. It is characterized by its distinctive, striated cap that ranges in color from pale yellow to brown. This fungus is typically found in moist, temperate forests where it colonizes fallen or decaying trees. It plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling by breaking down lignin and cellulose. Dendrophthora striata is a saprophytic species, meaning it derives nutrients from dead organic matter rather than living hosts."
