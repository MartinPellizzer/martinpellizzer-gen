    "intro": "Dryopteris nimbaensis, commonly known as the Nimba shield fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the Nimba Mountains of West Africa. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
