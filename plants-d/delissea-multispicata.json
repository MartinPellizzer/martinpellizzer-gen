    "intro": "Delissea multispicata, commonly known as the red-stemmed ironwood, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and sturdy, reddish-brown stems that provide structural support. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are leathery and aromatic, often used in traditional herbal remedies. Delissea multispicata is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
