    "intro": "Draba verna var. procerula, commonly known as the slender spring whitlow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically between March and May. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and early blooming habit, it is a valuable indicator species for habitat conservation."
