    "intro": "Dermasea elongata, commonly known as the elongated skin fern, is a unique plant characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions. The plant's rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern, and the fronds are often covered in a thin, waxy cuticle. Dermasea elongata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
