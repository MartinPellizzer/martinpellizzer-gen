    "intro": "Dactylis juncinella subsp. stebbinsii, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the nominate form of Dactylis juncinella."
