    "intro": "Daucus muricatus, commonly known as the hairy burr parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features a taproot with a distinctive hairy surface, and its stems are usually branched and covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish flowers are arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp that splits into two one-seeded parts when mature."
