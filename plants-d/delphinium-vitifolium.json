    "intro": "Delphinium vitifolium, commonly known as the grape-leaved larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are palmately compound, with elongated, grape-like leaflets that give the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for ornamental use in gardens."
