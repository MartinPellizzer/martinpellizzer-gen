    "intro": "Dendrostylis microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tree-like stem and a crown of feathery, pinnate fronds. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a dense, fibrous mat, which helps anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically small and delicate, contributing to its overall graceful appearance. Dendrostylis microphylla plays a role in tropical ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
