    "intro": "Drymaria conzattii, commonly known as the goldenweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. The species is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy plant in xerophytic landscapes."
