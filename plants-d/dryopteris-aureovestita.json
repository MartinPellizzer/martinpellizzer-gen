    "intro": "Dryopteris aureovestita, commonly known as the golden velvet fern, is a species of polypody fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, golden hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are leathery and have a distinctive, intricate pattern of veins. It is a perennial plant that reproduces through spores, with fertile fronds producing sporangia on the underside."
