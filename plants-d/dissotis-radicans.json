It features a sprawling growth habit with trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically arranged in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Dissotis radicans thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
