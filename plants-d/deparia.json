    "intro": "Deparia, commonly known as the common wood sorrel, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. These plants are characterized by their trifoliate leaves, which consist of three heart-shaped leaflets. They typically grow in moist, shady environments and are found in temperate regions around the world. Deparia species often produce small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is also known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid."
