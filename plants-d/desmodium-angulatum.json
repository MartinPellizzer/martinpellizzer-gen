    "intro": "Desmodium angulatum, commonly known as the angular desmodium, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Desmodium angulatum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
