    "intro": "Duroia eriopila var. eriopila, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a significant ecological concern in certain regions."
