    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 telesii, commonly known as the intermediate wood fern, is a hybrid fern resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful foliage."
