    "intro": "Dalbergia millettii, commonly known as African rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing flat, elongated seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forested areas. Due to its slow growth and high demand, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
