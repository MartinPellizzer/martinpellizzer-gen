    "intro": "Decaneuropsis andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's decaneuropsis, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its unique morphological features. The plant typically exhibits small, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
