    "intro": "Delphinium variegatum var. apiculatum, commonly known as the variable larkspur, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of vivid blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and pets."
