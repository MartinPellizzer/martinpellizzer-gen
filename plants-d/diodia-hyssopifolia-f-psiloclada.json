    "intro": "Diodia hyssopifolia f. psiloclada, commonly known as the psiloclada form of blueweed, is a variant of the annual herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, branching stems that are typically covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds. This form is notable for its morphological differences from the typical species, particularly in leaf structure and overall plant habit."
