    "intro": "Dryopteris wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories at high altitudes. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
