    "intro": "Diplostephium cajamarquillense, commonly known as the Peruvian burr cucumber, is a climbing vine native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers that are followed by inflated, spiky fruits resembling small, green gourds. These fruits contain numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind and animals. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists in the region."
