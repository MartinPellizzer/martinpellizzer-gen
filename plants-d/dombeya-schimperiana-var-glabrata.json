It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and often glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and native plant collections."
