    "intro": "Diplacus puniceus, commonly known as the scarlet gaura, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Diplacus puniceus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
