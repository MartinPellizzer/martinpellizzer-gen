    "intro": "Dryas octopetala var. integrifolia, commonly known as the alpine avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features a low-growing rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in dense, white to grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually entire, without toothed edges, and are adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. This variant is particularly noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils at high elevations."
