    "intro": "Dehaasia poilanei, commonly known as the Malagasy orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the forests of Madagascar. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the humid understory of tropical rainforests. Its botanical features include strap-like leaves and a short stem with a single, showy bloom. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Dehaasia poilanei is considered a critically endangered species."
