It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped leaves covered in sticky glands that trap insects. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture to flourish. This variety is particularly notable for its adaptability to swampy environments and its unique trapping mechanism."
