    "intro": "Diphasiastrum complanatum subsp. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
