    "intro": "Daucus maritimus f. multisectus, commonly known as the multilobe sea holly, is a rare and unique botanical variant of the sea holly species. It is characterized by its finely divided, multilobed leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in saline and sandy soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle floral element to its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
