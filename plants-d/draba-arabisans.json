    "intro": "Draba arabisans, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically has a rosette of basal leaves and produces bright yellow or white flowers that bloom in early spring. Draba arabisans thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its botanical features make it an important species in alpine ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
