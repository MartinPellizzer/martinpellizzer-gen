It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs, giving it a silvery or grayish appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its hairy foliage and adaptability make it a distinctive species in its ecological niche."
