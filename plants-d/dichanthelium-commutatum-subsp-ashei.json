    "intro": "Dichanthelium commutatum subsp. ashei, commonly known as Ashe's panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
