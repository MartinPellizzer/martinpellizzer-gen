    "intro": "Digitaria geniculata, commonly known as the bermudagrass or wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to warm temperate and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems, and it is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Digitaria geniculata is widely used in pastures and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and adaptability. It also plays a role in ecological systems, particularly in stabilizing soils in disturbed areas."
