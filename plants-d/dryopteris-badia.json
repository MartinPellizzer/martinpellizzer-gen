    "intro": "Dryopteris badia, commonly known as the red wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often have a reddish tint on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Dryopteris badia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
