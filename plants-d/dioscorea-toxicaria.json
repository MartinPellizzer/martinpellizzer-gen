    "intro": "Dioscorea toxicaria, commonly known as the toxic arrowroot, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for medicinal and culinary purposes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by yellowish fruits containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and twining. Due to the presence of toxic compounds, it requires careful handling and preparation before use."
