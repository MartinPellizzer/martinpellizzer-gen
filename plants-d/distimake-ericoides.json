    "intro": "Distimake ericoides, commonly known as the purple heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet-pink flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade. Distimake ericoides is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
