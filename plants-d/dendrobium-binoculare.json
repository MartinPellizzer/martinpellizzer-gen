    "intro": "Dendrobium binoculare, commonly known as the two-eyed dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has fleshy, cane-like stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat with limited rainfall. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces showy, long-lasting blooms during the summer months. Dendrobium binoculare is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
