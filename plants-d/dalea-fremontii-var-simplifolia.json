    "intro": "Dalea fremontii var. simplifolia, commonly known as the plains false indigo, is a perennial shrub native to the central and western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnately compound, and its spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. It is adapted to dry conditions and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping. Its nectar attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity in its native range."
