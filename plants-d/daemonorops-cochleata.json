    "intro": "Daemonorops cochleata, commonly known as the spiral cycad, is a member of the cycad family (Cycadaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiraling arrangement of leaves that give it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with long, narrow leaflets that are often described as resembling feathers. This species is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens for its striking foliage."
