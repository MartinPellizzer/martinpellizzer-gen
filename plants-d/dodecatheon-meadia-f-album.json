    "intro": "Dodecatheon meadia f. album, commonly known as the white trout lily, is a striking perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, nodding white flowers that resemble small trout, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and are pollinated by bees and other insects. The white form of this species is less common than the typical yellow-flowered variety, making it a rare and sought-after botanical specimen."
