It is characterized by its compound leaves with soft, hairy surfaces and clusters of small, pale yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces smooth, woody fruits that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy floral display."
