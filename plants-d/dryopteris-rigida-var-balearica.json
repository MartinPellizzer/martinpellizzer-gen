    "intro": "Dryopteris rigida var. balearica, commonly known as the Balearic wood fern, is a fern species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, upright growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
