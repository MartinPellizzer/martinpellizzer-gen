    "intro": "Dicalix forrestii, commonly known as the Forster's dicalix, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of western Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are elliptical and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are clustered in small inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dicalix forrestii is considered a species of conservation concern."
