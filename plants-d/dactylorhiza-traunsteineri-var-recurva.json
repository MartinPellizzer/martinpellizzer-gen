    "intro": "Dactylorhiza traunsteineri var. recurva, commonly known as the recurved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wet meadows and marshy areas in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive recurved lip, which is a key feature of the varietal name. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires a moist, cool climate for optimal growth. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare and conservation-dependent species."
