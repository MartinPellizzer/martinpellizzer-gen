    "intro": "Discocoffea, commonly known as the Jamaican coffee bean, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is closely related to the coffee genus Coffea. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that contain the seeds used for coffee production. Discocoffea is characterized by its dense foliage and compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and low yield, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
