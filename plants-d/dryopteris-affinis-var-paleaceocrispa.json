    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis var. paleaceocrispa, commonly known as the pale fronded wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its pale, silvery-green fronds that are often tinged with a bluish hue, distinguishing it from other varieties. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in rich, organic soil. Its fronds are bipinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. This fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a specimen plant in shaded areas."
