    "intro": "Dictyoneura rhomboidea, commonly known as the rhomboid flatback spider, is a species of spider belonging to the family Dictyopidae. It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened body and a unique coloration pattern that includes a mix of brown and white markings. This arachnid is typically found in coastal habitats, particularly in sandy areas and dunes along the eastern coast of Australia. The plant-like appearance of its body has led to its common name, which may contribute to confusion with certain plants. However, it is important to note that Dictyoneura rhomboidea is an arachnid, not a plant, and thus does not have botanical features such as leaves, stems, or roots."
