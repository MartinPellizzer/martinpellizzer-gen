    "intro": "Dryopteris taiwanicola, commonly known as the Taiwan wood fern, is a species of fern native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces clusters of fertile fronds that are shorter than the sterile ones. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
