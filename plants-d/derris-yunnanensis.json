    "intro": "Derris yunnanensis, commonly known as the Chinese snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to southern China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers and is known for its alkaloid-rich roots, which have been used in traditional medicine. Its botanical significance lies in its chemical composition, particularly the presence of rotenone, a compound with pesticidal properties. However, due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes."
