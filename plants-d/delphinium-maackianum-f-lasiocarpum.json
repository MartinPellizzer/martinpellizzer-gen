It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant is notable for its unique fruit structure, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it the specific epithet *lasiocarpum*. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
