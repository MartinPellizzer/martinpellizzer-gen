    "intro": "Dryopteris baramensis, commonly known as the Baram fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The Baram fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial sunlight."
