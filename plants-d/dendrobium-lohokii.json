    "intro": "Dendrobium lohokii, commonly known as the Lohokii orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dendrobium genus, which includes over 1,200 species of orchids known for their diverse floral forms and growth habits. This particular species is characterized by its compact, branching structure and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dendrobium lohokii is considered a valuable and often endangered species in its native range."
