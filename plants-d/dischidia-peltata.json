    "intro": "Dischidia peltata, commonly known as the shield fig, is a climbing or trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Moraceae and is characterized by its unique, shield-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, fig-like fruits that are edible for certain animals. Its aerial roots allow it to attach to trees and other structures, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or green walls. Dischidia peltata is relatively easy to care for, thriving in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
