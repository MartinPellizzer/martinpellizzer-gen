    "intro": "Dodonaea microcarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hop bush, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, woody fruits called drupes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry woodland habitats. Dodonaea microcarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
