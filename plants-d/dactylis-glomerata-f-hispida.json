    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata f. hispida, commonly known as hairy cocksfoot, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. It features slender, wiry stems that often form compact clumps, and its leaves are typically hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are usually pale green to brown in color. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its use in forage and soil stabilization due to its hardiness and persistence."
