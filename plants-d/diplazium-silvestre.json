    "intro": "Diplazium silvestre, commonly known as the common cliffbrake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new growth from the base, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Diplazium silvestre is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can also serve as a food source for certain wildlife."
