    "intro": "Desmodium nudiflorum f. foliolatum, commonly known as the leafy desmodium, is a variant of the species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a leguminous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically smaller and more densely arranged compared to the standard form. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by flat, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings to improve soil fertility."
