    "intro": "Drymonia candida, commonly known as the white marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, forming a dense rosette near the base. Drymonia candida plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
