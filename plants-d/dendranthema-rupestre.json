    "intro": "Dendranthema rupestre, commonly known as stonecrop, is a hardy perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are typically succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Dendranthema rupestre is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
