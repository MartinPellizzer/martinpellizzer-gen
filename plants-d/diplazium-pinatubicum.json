    "intro": "Diplazium pinatubicum, commonly known as the pinatubic fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, elongated segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies, and is native to regions in Southeast Asia. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role. The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, but this trait is not commonly observed in Diplazium pinatubicum."
