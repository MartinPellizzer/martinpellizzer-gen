    "intro": "Dendrophorbium fruticosum, commonly known as the shrub-like orchid, is a perennial plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
