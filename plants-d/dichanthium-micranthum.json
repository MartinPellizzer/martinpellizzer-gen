    "intro": "Dichanthium micranthum, commonly known as dwarf grass or small-bracted grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with short, bract-like structures, and its florets are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Dichanthium micranthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
