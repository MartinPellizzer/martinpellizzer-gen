    "intro": "Dalea rosarum, commonly known as roseleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Dalea rosarum is also valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for native pollinators."
