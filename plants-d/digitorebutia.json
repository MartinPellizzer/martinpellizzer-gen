    "intro": "Digitorebutia, commonly known as the \"Bloomerang\" or \"Tropical Honeysuckle,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to Central and South America. These plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. Digitorebutia species are typically shrubs or small trees, often growing in tropical and subtropical climates. They have opposite, simple leaves and produce small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. The genus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, humid environments."
