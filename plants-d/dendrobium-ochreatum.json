    "intro": "Dendrobium ochreatum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a distinctive yellow or orange throat. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements have made it a favored ornamental plant among orchid enthusiasts."
