    "intro": "Diphyes, commonly known as the two-leaved plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinct leaf morphology. It typically features two different types of leaves on the same plant, one pair of basal leaves and another pair of alternate leaves along the stem. The basal leaves are usually larger and broader, while the alternate leaves are smaller and more elongated. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological variation, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
