    "intro": "Discocactus squamibaccatus, commonly known as the woolly discocactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs that protect it from intense sunlight and dehydration. The plant typically grows as a solitary stem with a spherical or elongated shape. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the base of the stem. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
