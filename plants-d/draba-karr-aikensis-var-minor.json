    "intro": "Draba karr-aikensis var. minor, commonly known as the Karr-aik dwarf whitlow grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. This variety is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers."
