    "intro": "Diospyros densa, commonly known as the dense persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits. Its fruit is edible, though some varieties may have astringent or bitter taste when unripe. Diospyros densa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique fruit and timber."
