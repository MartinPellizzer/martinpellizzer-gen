    "intro": "Doronicum oppositifolium, commonly known as the oppositifolium leopard's bane, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Doronicum oppositifolium is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
