It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with spines that help reduce water loss. Its growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping in regions with similar climates."
