    "intro": "Drynaria diversifolia, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded forest environments, often as an epiphyte. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Drynaria diversifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
