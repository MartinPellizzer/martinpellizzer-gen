It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its distinctive, compound fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky habitats. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of spore-bearing sorus clusters. Diplazium welwitschii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
