    "intro": "Dasycondylus platylepis, commonly known as the broad-shouldered leafhopper, is a small insect belonging to the family Cicadellidae. It is characterized by its elongated body and distinctive broad shoulders, which are adapted for grasping plant surfaces. This species is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it feeds on the sap of various plants. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a herbivorous pest that can affect the growth of economically important crops. The plant's morphology and chemical composition may influence the insect's feeding behavior and population dynamics."
