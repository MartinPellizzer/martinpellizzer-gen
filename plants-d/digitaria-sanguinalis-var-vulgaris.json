    "intro": "Digitaria sanguinalis var. vulgaris, commonly known as common brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with small, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including fields, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and is often found in moist to dry environments. Common brome is a perennial plant that is well adapted to temperate climates and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
