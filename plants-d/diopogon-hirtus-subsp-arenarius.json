    "intro": "Diopogon hirtus subsp. arenarius, commonly known as the sand diopogon, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. Its leaves are usually small, hairy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is well adapted to sandy soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
