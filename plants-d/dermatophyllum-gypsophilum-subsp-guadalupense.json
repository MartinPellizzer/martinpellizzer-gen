    "intro": "Dermatophyllum gypsophilum subsp. guadalupense, commonly known as the Guadalupine gypsum plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Texas and New Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. It is often found in gypsum outcrops and is a member of the Amaranthaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
