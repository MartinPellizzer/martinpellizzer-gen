    "intro": "Dryopteris spinosa, commonly known as the spinous wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The rhizomes of Dryopteris spinosa are often thick and wiry, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas."
