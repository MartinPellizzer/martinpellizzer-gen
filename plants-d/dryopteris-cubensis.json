    "intro": "Dryopteris cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are typically divided into a series of lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a distinctive, shield-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds."
