    "intro": "Delphinium cardiopetalum, commonly known as the heart-leaved larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The leaves are deeply lobed, with a distinctive heart-shaped base, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care."
