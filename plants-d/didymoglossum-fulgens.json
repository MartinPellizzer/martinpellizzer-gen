    "intro": "Didymoglossum fulgens, commonly known as the golden moss, is a small, delicate liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its bright green, upright shoots and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. Didymoglossum fulgens plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
