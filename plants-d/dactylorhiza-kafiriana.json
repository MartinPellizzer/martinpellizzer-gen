    "intro": "Dactylorhiza kafiriana, commonly known as the Kafir orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It is a rhizomatous herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and grasslands. The plant produces tall, erect stems with numerous showy, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Dactylorhiza kafiriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens."
