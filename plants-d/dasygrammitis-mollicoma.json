    "intro": "Dasygrammitis mollicoma, commonly known as the soft moss fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, soft fronds that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy coating, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests, where it attaches itself to trees or rocks. Its small, closely spaced leaves are adapted for efficient moisture retention in its moist, low-light habitat. Dasygrammitis mollicoma is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in controlled greenhouse conditions."
