    "intro": "Daemonorops barbata, commonly known as the feather palm, is a species of cycad-like plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of long, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is dioecious, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. Daemonorops barbata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils. It plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional practices."
