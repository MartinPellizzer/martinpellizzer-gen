    "intro": "Diplazium lustrosum, commonly known as the glossy fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a waxy, glossy sheen. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fertile fronds."
