    "intro": "Dethawia tenuifolia subsp. cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian slender fern, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This subspecies thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous woodlands and rocky slopes. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, closely arranged pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
