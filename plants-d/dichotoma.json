    "intro": "Dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous branching plant, is a type of plant characterized by its unique growth pattern where the stem splits into two equal branches at each node. This branching pattern continues recursively, creating a symmetrical, fractal-like structure. The plant typically belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes aromatic herbs like parsley and dill. Its leaves are often finely divided and arranged in a whorled fashion around the stem. Dichotoma is often found in moist, temperate environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties."
