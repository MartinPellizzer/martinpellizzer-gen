    "intro": "Dryopteris fijiensis, commonly known as the Fiji shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of the South Pacific, including Fiji and parts of Australia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply divided fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid rainforests or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in rows on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris fijiensis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
