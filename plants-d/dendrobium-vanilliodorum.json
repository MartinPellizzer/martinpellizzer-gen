    "intro": "Dendrobium vanilliodorum, commonly known as the vanilla orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, often found on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, and its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients. It is noted for its vanilla-scented blossoms, which have historically been used in perfumery and traditional medicine. Dendrobium vanilliodorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and unique aromatic properties."
