    "intro": "Deltocarpus, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, showy flower head that resembles a dandelion. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is found in various regions across Europe and Asia. Deltocarpus species are often short-lived annuals or biennials, completing their life cycle within one or two growing seasons. The flowers are typically yellow, with a central disc surrounded by ray florets, and the plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds."
