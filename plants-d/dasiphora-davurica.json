    "intro": "Dasiphora davurica, commonly known as the yellow sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Dasiphora davurica is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
