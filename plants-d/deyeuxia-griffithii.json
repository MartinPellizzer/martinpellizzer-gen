It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
