    "intro": "Dryopteris chingii, commonly known as the Chinese wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive, velvety underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Dryopteris chingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
