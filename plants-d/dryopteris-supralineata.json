    "intro": "Dryopteris supralineata, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, lobed fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, upright growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
