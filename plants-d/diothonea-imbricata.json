    "intro": "Diothonea imbricata, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in a head, blooming in spring or early summer. Diothonea imbricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
