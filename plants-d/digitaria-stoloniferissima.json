    "intro": "Digitaria stoloniferissima, commonly known as flatpointer grass, is a perennial grass species native to the warm temperate and tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its spreading growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has narrow, linear leaves with a bluish-green color. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which are often loosely arranged. Digitaria stoloniferissima is often found in disturbed soils, lawns, and along roadsides, and it is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
