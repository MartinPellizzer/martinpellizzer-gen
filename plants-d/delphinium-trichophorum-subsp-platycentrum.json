    "intro": "Delphinium trichophorum subsp. platycentrum, commonly known as the broad-centred larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, erect stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which are typically spurred at the base. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
