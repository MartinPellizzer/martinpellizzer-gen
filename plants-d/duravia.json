    "intro": "Duravia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions under moonlight. The plant has a short lifespan, blooming only once during its brief existence. Its flowers emit a faint bioluminescent glow, which attracts nocturnal pollinators. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Duravia is protected in its natural habitat."
