    "intro": "Delissea arborea, commonly known as the tree dandelion, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse seeds via the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or savanna habitats. Delissea arborea is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
