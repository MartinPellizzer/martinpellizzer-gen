    "intro": "Diplazium umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often dark green and slightly glossy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Diplazium umbrosum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
