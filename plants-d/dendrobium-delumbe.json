    "intro": "Dendrobium delumbe, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with numerous short, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, golden-yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Dendrobium delumbe thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media."
