    "intro": "Diplopappus ericoides var. hirtellus, commonly known as the hirtellus heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in the spring. Its woody stems are usually reddish-brown and can branch out into a compact, cushion-like form. This variety is well adapted to acidic, sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
