    "intro": "Desmodium dispermum, commonly known as smallflower burr medic, is a leguminous plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is also used as a forage crop and in soil enrichment."
