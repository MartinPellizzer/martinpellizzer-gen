    "intro": "Dianthus camusii var. macrorhizus, commonly known as the large-rooted campfire pink, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features fleshy, basal leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its root system is notably robust and extensive, contributing to its ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
