    "intro": "Delphinium ranunculifolium var. incisum, commonly known as the cut-leaved larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often deeply incised, giving it a delicate appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, moist soils. This variety is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and is also noted for its toxic alkaloids, which make it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
