    "intro": "Dahlstedtia calcarata, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky areas. Dahlstedtia calcarata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
