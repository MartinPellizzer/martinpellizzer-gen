    "intro": "Datura innoxia subsp. quinquecuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved jimsonweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems, narrow lance-shaped leaves, and large, showy flowers that range from white to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its hallucinogenic properties due to the presence of tropane alkaloids. This species thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid environments."
