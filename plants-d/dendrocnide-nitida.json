    "intro": "Dendrocnide nitida, commonly known as the silky ant plant, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and it is known for its stinging hairs that can cause skin irritation. Dendrocnide nitida typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests, and is often found in the understorey of dense vegetation. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural interest."
