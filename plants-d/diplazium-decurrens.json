    "intro": "Diplazium decurrens, commonly known as the running brake fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a slender and graceful appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant's reproductive structures include sori that are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds."
