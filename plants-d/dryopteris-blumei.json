    "intro": "Dryopteris blumei, commonly known as the Blume's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Japan. It is characterized by its large, triangular-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread and establish itself in shaded environments. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, elegant appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Dryopteris blumei thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it well-suited for woodland gardens."
