    "intro": "Diacrium, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks rising from water. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that float on the surface of the water, aiding in photosynthesis. Its flowers typically open at dawn and close at sunset, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Diacrium is valued not only for its aesthetic beauty but also for its cultural and medicinal significance in traditional practices."
