    "intro": "Desmodium luteocanescens, commonly known as yellow false indigo, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with yellowish-green leaflets and small, pea-like flowers that range from white to pale yellow. The plant produces cylindrical, woody pods containing several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Desmodium luteocanescens is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and agroforestry systems."
