    "intro": "Drosera binata var. rubra, commonly known as the red-stemmed sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its reddish stems and leaves covered in sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils. It is a low-growing perennial that prefers shady, boggy habitats. Its unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
