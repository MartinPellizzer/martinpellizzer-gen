    "intro": "Drypetes congestiflora, commonly known as the clustered flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright red flowers that bloom throughout the year, making it a striking ornamental plant. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly glossy appearance. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests."
