    "intro": "Dipodium punctatum var. stenocheilum, commonly known as the narrow-lipped dipodium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, narrow-lipped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant features fleshy, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
