It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plants are characterized by their silvery-gray foliage and showy yellow or white flowers that bloom in spring. Didiclis species are typically low-growing shrubs with a compact, bushy form.
