    "intro": "Dryopteris wariensis, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a long, tapering shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris wariensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
