It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in fibrous roots and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and can grow up to several meters in height. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, with a deep green color and a distinctive, elongated shape. Dryopteris cyatheoides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
