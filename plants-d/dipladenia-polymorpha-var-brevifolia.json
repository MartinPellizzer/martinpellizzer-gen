    "intro": "Dipladenia polymorpha var. brevifolia, commonly known as the compact dipladenia, is a compact, trailing plant native to South America. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of orange and yellow, which bloom profusely during the summer months. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular for hanging baskets and as a decorative plant due to its compact growth habit and vibrant blooms."
