    "intro": "Decaisnina crassilimba, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock heath, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and sandy soils. The plant has woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its small, white to pale pink flowers bloom in spring, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Decaisnina crassilimba is well adapted to coastal environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological value."
