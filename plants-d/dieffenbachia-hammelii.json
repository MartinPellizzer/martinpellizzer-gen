    "intro": "Dieffenbachia hammelii, commonly known as the Hammel's Dieffenbachia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with white and green streaks on its broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, which includes other popular houseplants like peace lilies and callas. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is not only ornamental but also toxic if ingested, making it important to handle with care."
