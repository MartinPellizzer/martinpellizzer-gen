    "intro": "Dracaena glomerata, commonly known as the corn plant, is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a perennial evergreen plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and rosette of long, narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of white flowers, followed by red berries, though it is rarely seen in cultivation due to its flowering rarity. Dracaena glomerata is well-suited for indoor environments and requires bright, indirect light and moderate watering. Its adaptability and air-purifying properties make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
