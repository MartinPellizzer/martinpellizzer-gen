    "intro": "Dracocephalum bipinnatum var. brevilobum, commonly known as narrow-lobed blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered with fine, hairy foliage. The leaves are pinnately divided into narrow, lance-shaped lobes, giving the plant its \"bipinnatum\" designation. Small, blue to violet flowers are clustered in loose spikes, typical of the mint family (Lamiaceae). This plant is valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
