    "intro": "Dryopteris hirtipes var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese hairy wood fern, is a variant of the hairy wood fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
