    "intro": "Dendrobium aethalodes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in montane forests. Its unique appearance and elusive nature make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas."
