    "intro": "Dalechampia scandens var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf horse chestnut, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is a climbing plant with heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are smaller than those of the typical horse chestnut. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important plant in its native habitat."
