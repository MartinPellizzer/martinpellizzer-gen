It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom at night. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
