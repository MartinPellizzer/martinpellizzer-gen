It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and oval, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers with three petals and three sepals, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and meadows. Dactylorhiza cordigera is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
