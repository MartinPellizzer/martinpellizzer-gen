    "intro": "Dioscorea multiflora, commonly known as the Chinese yam, is a herbaceous perennial vine native to East Asia. It features a climbing habit with long, slender stems and heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by cylindrical, fleshy tubers that are widely used in traditional medicine and cuisine. Its tubers are rich in starch and have a slightly sweet, nutty flavor. Dioscorea multiflora is valued for its medicinal properties, including potential anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting effects."
