    "intro": "Daviesia phyllodinea var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf sickle-hillary, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, and its yellow or orange flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. This variety is distinguished by its smaller leaves compared to the typical form of Daviesia phyllodinea."
