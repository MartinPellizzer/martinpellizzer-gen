    "intro": "Decastemon zanzibaricus, commonly known as the Zanzibar lily, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shores, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Decastemon zanzibaricus is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
