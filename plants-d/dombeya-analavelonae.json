    "intro": "Dombeya analavelonae, commonly known as the Madagascar dombeya, is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late winter to early spring. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
