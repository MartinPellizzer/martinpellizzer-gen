    "intro": "Dendrobium changjiangense, commonly known as the Changjiang orchid, is a species of orchid native to China. It is an epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are usually fragrant and come in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. It is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its cultural significance in traditional Chinese horticulture."
