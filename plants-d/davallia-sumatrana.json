    "intro": "Davallia sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran water fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Davallia sumatrana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
