    "intro": "Dryopteris adaucta, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky coating. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a graceful, arching appearance that adds aesthetic value to its natural habitat."
