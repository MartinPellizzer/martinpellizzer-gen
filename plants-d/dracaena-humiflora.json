    "intro": "Dracaena humiflora, commonly known as the dwarf dracaena or creeping dracaena, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing shrub with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, often emerging from the base of the plant. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. Dracaena humiflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
