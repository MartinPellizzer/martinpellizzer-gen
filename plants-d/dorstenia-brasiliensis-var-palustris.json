    "intro": "Dorstenia brasiliensis var. palustris, commonly known as the swamp dorstenia, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America. It features a distinctive, fleshy, spirally twisted stem that is often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in humid conditions. This variety is valued for its unique morphology and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in tropical gardens."
