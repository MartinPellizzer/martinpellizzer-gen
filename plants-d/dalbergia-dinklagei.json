    "intro": "Dalbergia dinklagei, commonly known as the Dinklage rosewood, is a rare and highly valued tropical tree native to the humid lowland forests of western Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood with a rich, aromatic scent. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several flat, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
