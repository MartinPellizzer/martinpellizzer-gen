    "intro": "Duma horrida subsp. horrida, commonly known as the rough duma, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which give it a rough and sometimes unpleasant texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
