    "intro": "Dracaena angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dracaena, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by red berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena angustifolia is a low-maintenance plant that is popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
