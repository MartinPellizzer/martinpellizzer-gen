    "intro": "Dracontia tintinnabula, commonly known as the bell-shaped fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped fronds that give it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Dracontia tintinnabula is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
