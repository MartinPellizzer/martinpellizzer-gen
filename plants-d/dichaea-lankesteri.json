    "intro": "Dichaea lankesteri, commonly known as the Lankester's spider orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It features small, intricate flowers with a distinctive spider-like appearance, which gives it its common name. The plant has thin, wiry stems and produces tiny, green leaves that are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. It thrives in high humidity and requires specific conditions to bloom, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Dichaea lankesteri is considered endangered."
