    "intro": "Dryas punctata subsp. hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and hairy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
