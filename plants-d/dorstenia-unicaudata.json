It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that resemble tendrils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
