    "intro": "Diplotaxis erucoides subsp. cossoniana, commonly known as the African wall lettuce, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features basal rosettes of silver-green, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, branched inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines for their mild, peppery flavor. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in xeriscaping."
