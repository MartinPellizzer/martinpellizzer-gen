    "intro": "Diospyros pearcei, commonly known as the Mexican persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits resembling persimmons. Its fruits are edible, sweet, and often used in local cuisines, though they are not as widely cultivated as other persimmon species."
