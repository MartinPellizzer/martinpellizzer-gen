    "intro": "Dichapetalum lescrauwaetii, commonly known as the Lescauwae's dichapetalum, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. Its flowering period occurs during the wet season, and it plays a minor role in local ecosystems due to its limited distribution. Despite its botanical interest, it remains understudied and is considered a species of conservation concern."
