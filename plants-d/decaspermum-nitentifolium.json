    "intro": "Decaspermum nitentifolium, commonly known as the morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning and close in the afternoon. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found growing along roadsides and in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth habit and climbing nature make it a common weed in agricultural areas. The seeds are encased in a fibrous, spiny capsule that disperses readily by wind or animal contact."
