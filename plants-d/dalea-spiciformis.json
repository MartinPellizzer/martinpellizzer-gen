    "intro": "Dalea spiciformis, commonly known as the spiciform blazingstar, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy yellow flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous thread-like leaflets, and its root system is fibrous, contributing to its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in prairies and open woodlands, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
