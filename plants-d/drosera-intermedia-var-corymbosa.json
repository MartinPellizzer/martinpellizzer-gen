    "intro": "Drosera intermedia var. corymbosa, commonly known as the variable sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and fens. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers in dense clusters, which is why it is also called the clustered sundew. The variety corymbosa is distinguished by its more elongated leaves and more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form of Drosera intermedia."
