    "intro": "Daboecia azorica f. albiflora, commonly known as the Azorean white-flowered heath, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the islands of the Azores. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth form. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically evergreen, leathery, and adapted to the humid, acidic soils of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
