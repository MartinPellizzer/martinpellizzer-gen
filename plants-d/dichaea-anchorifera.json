    "intro": "Dichaea anchorifera, commonly known as the anchor fern, is a species of epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate, while its leaves are usually pinnately divided. Dichaea anchorifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant in warm climates."
