    "intro": "Dryopteris subbiaurita, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically leathery and dark green, with a yellowish or golden hue on the underside. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Dryopteris subbiaurita is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
