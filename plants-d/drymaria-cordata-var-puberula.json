    "intro": "Drymaria cordata var. puberula, commonly known as hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of North America. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with succulent, hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it well adapted to dry environments. It is often found in disturbed soils and is a common sight in coastal dunes and sandy habitats."
