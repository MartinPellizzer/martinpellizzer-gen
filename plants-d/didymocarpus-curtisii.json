    "intro": "Didymocarpus curtisii, commonly known as the Philippine white ironwood, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant is known for its hard, heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. It typically grows in lowland and mountainous areas, often in humid, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
