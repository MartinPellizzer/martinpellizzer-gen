    "intro": "Dicksonia squarrosa var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a variant of the common tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, gracefully tapering trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that can reach several meters in height. The plant has a distinctive crown of long, pinnate fronds that give it a lush, tropical appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
