    "intro": "Delphinium caprorum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces clusters of striking blue, violet, or white flowers, which are typically arranged in racemes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, aiding in moisture retention in its alpine habitat. Delphinium caprorum is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in gardens and its ecological importance to pollinators."
