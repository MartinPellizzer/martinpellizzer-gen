    "intro": "Diplazium ternatum, commonly known as the three-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into three segments, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Diplazium ternatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
