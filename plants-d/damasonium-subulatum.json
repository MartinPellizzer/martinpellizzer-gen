    "intro": "Damasonium subulatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in dense spikes, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by water. Damasonium subulatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
