    "intro": "Danthonia decumbens, commonly known as the creeping danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes. The leaves are narrow, flat, and covered in fine hairs, while the inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
