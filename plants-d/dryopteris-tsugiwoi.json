    "intro": "Dryopteris tsugiwoi, commonly known as the Japanese Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
