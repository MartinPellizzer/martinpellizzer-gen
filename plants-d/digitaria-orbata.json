It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Digitaria orbata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. It is sometimes used in traditional landscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
