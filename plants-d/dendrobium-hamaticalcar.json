    "intro": "Dendrobium hamaticalcar, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually yellow or golden in color, with a distinctive, elongated shape. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
