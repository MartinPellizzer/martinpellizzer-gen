It features rosettes of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with white or pale edges. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
