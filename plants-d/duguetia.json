    "intro": "Duguetia, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plants are characterized by their striking, showy flowers that often resemble butterflies, hence their common name. Duguetia species typically have opposite, simple leaves and produce small, fleshy fruits. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and are valued for their ornamental appeal."
