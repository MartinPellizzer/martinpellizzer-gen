    "intro": "Dudleya laxa, commonly known as the low dudleya, is a succulent plant native to coastal areas of California and Baja California. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces tall, branching stalks with clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant. Dudleya laxa is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
