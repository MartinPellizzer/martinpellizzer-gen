    "intro": "Dryopteris moreletii, commonly known as the Morelet's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Central America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically pinnately divided with a distinctive, narrow shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients effectively. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid conditions."
