    "intro": "Dubouzetia campanulata, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Dubouzetia campanulata is often found in montane grasslands and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat."
