    "intro": "Dryopteris neglecta, commonly known as the neglected wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodland edges. The plant features a short, stout rhizome with dark brown, wiry roots and produces delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often folded when young. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris neglecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its graceful, fern-like appearance."
