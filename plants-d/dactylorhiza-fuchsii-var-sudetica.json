    "intro": "Dactylorhiza fuchsii var. sudetica, commonly known as the Sudetic marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe, particularly found in wet meadows and marshy areas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces numerous small, lance-shaped leaves. It is a perennial species that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. The variety sudetica is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and slightly different floral morphology compared to other variants of Dactylorhiza fuchsii."
