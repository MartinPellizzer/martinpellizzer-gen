    "intro": "Dendrobium hooglandianum, commonly known as the Highland Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length, and it produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged along the stem. Dendrobium hooglandianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
