    "intro": "Didymoglossum ferox, commonly known as the hairy haircap moss, is a small, cushion-like moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and dark green, wiry stems covered in short, stiff hairs. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a distinctive costa that is often prolonged into a short, stiff apex. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocky soils or in woodland areas. This species is notable for its resilience and ability to colonize disturbed or nutrient-poor sites."
