    "intro": "Diplazium viridissimum, commonly known as the green fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually bright green. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
