    "intro": "Dendrobium pseudopeloricum, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers that range from yellow to orange, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Dendrobium pseudopeloricum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
