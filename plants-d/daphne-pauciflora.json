    "intro": "Daphne pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered daphne, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries. Daphne pauciflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
