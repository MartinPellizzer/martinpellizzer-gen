    "intro": "Delphinium intermedium var. laxum, commonly known as the lax flower delphinium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it prefers well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This variety is less commonly found in cultivation compared to other delphinium species, making it a rare and sought-after addition to botanical collections."
