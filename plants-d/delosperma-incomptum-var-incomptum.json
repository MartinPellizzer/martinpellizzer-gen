    "intro": "Delosperma incomptum var. incomptum, commonly known as the narrowleaf ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are narrow and slightly curled at the tips. The plant produces vibrant pink to purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense clusters. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. This species is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
