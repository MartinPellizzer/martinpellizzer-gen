    "intro": "Delphinium iliense var. macrocentrum, commonly known as the large-centred larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in dense spikes, with large, showy upper petals that are often more prominent than the lower ones. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, typical of many delphinium species. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
