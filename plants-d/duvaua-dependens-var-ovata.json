    "intro": "Duvaua dependens var. ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaf duvaua, is a unique flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its ovate, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
