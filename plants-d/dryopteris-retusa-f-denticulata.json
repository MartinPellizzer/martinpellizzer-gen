    "intro": "Dryopteris retusa f. denticulata, commonly known as the denticulate wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and reproductive structures. It features bipinnate fronds with a serrated or toothed margin, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
