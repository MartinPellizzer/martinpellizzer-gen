    "intro": "Dryopteris dielsii, commonly known as the Diels' wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year, producing spores on the underside of the leaves."
