    "intro": "Drymaria divaricata var. viscidula, commonly known as sticky sandspur, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape and have a slightly hairy texture. One of its most notable botanical features is the presence of sticky glands on its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and dunes."
