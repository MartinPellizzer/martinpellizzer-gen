    "intro": "Drymaria fenzliana, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically silver-gray due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Drymaria fenzliana is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it a resilient species in disturbed or sandy soils."
