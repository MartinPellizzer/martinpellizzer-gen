    "intro": "Dactylorchis praetermissa var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces delicate, pale green or white flowers with a distinct, almost translucent appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
