    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 guillaumeae, commonly known as the Guillaume's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has linear to lance-shaped leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also considered vulnerable in the wild."
