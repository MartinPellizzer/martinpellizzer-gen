    "intro": "Daphne pontica subsp. melanocarpa, commonly known as the black-fruited daphne, is a perennial shrub native to the Caucasus region. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring. The plant is notable for its dark, berry-like fruits that ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
