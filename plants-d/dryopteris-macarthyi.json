    "intro": "Dryopteris macarthyi, commonly known as the Macarthur's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in the wild."
