    "intro": "Deyeuxia cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in Asia. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Deyeuxia cylindrica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
