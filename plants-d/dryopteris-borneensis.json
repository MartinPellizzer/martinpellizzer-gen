    "intro": "Dryopteris borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean wood fern, is a species of fern native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are extensively branched, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive shape that contributes to its ornamental value in horticulture."
