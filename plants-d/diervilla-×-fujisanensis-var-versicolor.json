    "intro": "Diervilla \u00d7 fujisanensis var. versicolor, commonly known as the Japanese crossberry, is a hybrid shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its seasonal color changes and attractive foliage."
