    "intro": "Dicrocaulon humile, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water such as ponds and wetlands. It has no true leaves, instead having whorls of small, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, contributing to its distribution in freshwater habitats."
