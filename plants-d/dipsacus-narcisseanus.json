    "intro": "Dipsacus narcisseanus, commonly known as the yellow hogweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmate leaves with a distinctive, hairy texture and a strong, often unpleasant odor. It is part of the Caprifoliaceae family and can grow up to 2 meters in height. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
