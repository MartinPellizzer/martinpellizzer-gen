    "intro": "Dryopteris lepidocaulis, commonly known as the rock brake fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered with a fine, scaly texture. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually over time. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
