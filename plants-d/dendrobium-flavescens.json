    "intro": "Dendrobium flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-lipped orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, pseudobulb-like stems that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, often with a distinctive orange lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium flavescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
