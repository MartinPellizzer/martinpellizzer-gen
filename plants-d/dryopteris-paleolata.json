    "intro": "Dryopteris paleolata, commonly known as the ancient fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant has a distinctive, fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris paleolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
