    "intro": "Dendrobium triadenium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in many regions."
