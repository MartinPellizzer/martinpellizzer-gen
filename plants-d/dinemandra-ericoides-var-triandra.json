It features small, leathery leaves that are typically three-lobed, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy ornamental plant in suitable climates."
