    "intro": "Dipsacus schimperi, commonly known as the African teasel, is a perennial herb native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the burdock family (Araliaceae) and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny seed heads. Its root system is fibrous and can reach significant depths, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Dipsacus schimperi is often found in open woodland and grassland habitats."
