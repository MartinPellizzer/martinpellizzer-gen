    "intro": "Dissotis canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, upright stems covered in a fine, whitish pubescence that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture and a silvery-gray underside. Dissotis canescens is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils."
