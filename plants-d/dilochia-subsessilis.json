    "intro": "Dilochia subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock heath, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in the spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
