    "intro": "Dortmanna obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed Dortmanna, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along streambanks. The plant features lanceolate to obovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Dortmanna obovata plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued in ecological restoration projects."
