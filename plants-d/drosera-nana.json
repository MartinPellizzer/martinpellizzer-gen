    "intro": "Drosera nana, commonly known as the small sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to moist, acidic environments in temperate regions. It features a low-growing rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant's small, delicate flowers are typically pink or red, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent moisture to maintain its health. Due to its unique appearance and trapping mechanism, it is a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
