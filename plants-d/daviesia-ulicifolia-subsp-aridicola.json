    "intro": "Daviesia ulicifolia subsp. aridicola, commonly known as the aridland hakea, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers during the autumn season, which are attractive to nectar-feeding insects. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is an important component of local biodiversity in its habitat."
