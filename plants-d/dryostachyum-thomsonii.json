    "intro": "Dryostachyum thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in its native environment. Thomson's grass is often found in association with other wetland flora, playing a role in maintaining ecological balance in these habitats."
