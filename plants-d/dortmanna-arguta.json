    "intro": "Dortmanna arguta, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a small, flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The small, pinkish-white flowers appear in clusters and bloom in the spring, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
