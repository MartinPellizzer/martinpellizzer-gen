    "intro": "Dodonaea schiedeana, commonly known as the silver dollar tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with a silvery-white underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by spherical, red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Dodonaea schiedeana is also valued for its ability to stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion."
