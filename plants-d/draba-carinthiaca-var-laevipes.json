    "intro": "Draba carinthiaca var. laevipes, commonly known as the smoothleaf winter cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically features basal rosettes of lanceolate, glabrous leaves and produces yellow or white flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
