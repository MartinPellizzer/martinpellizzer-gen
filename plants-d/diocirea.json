    "intro": "Diocirea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of South America and are characterized by their unique, often pale or translucent petals. Diocirea species typically have showy, butterfly-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. They are often found in shaded, moist environments within rainforests. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking floral display."
