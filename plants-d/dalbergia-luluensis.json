    "intro": "Dalbergia luluensis, commonly known as the Lulu ebony, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and timber quality, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for local use."
