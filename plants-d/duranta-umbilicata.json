    "intro": "Duranta umbilicata, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 feet tall, characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that develop into blue or purple berries. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flowers and colorful fruit, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
