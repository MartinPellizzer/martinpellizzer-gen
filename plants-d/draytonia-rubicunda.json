    "intro": "Draytonia rubicunda, commonly known as the red-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often covered in bladders used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its stems are reddish in color, which helps distinguish it from other bladderwort species. Draytonia rubicunda is an important indicator species for healthy aquatic ecosystems due to its sensitivity to water quality."
