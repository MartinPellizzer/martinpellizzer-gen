    "intro": "Dufrenoya pruinosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or pruinose dufrenoya, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a slight purple or greenish tinge. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or along riverbanks. Dufrenoya pruinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
