It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant is most notable for its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, emitting a strong scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters and have a unique structure with five petals that curl inward as they age. Dichapetalum mundense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
