    "intro": "Dioscorea atrescens, commonly known as the African yam bean, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary storage organs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the stems are hairy and tend to climb by twining around supports. The tubers are edible when properly prepared and have been used traditionally for food and medicinal purposes."
