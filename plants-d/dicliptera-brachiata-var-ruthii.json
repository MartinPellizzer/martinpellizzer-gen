    "intro": "Dicliptera brachiata var. ruthii, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial herb native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its erect, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by capsule fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
