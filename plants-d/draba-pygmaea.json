    "intro": "Draba pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in tight, cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are basal, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its harsh environment. Draba pygmaea is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stability and providing nectar for early pollinators."
