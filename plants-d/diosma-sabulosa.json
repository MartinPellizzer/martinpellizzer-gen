    "intro": "Diosma sabulosa, commonly known as sand diosma, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal and inland desert regions. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Diosma sabulosa plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
