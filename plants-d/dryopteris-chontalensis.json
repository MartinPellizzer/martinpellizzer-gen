    "intro": "Dryopteris chontalensis, commonly known as the Chontal fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
