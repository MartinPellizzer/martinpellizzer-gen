    "intro": "Diplanthera sessilifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bluebell, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a stalk. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
