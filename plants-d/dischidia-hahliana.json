    "intro": "Dischidia hahliana, commonly known as the Hahli's fig. It is a climbing epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. Its small, clustered flowers are typically greenish-white, and it produces edible, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for various animals. Dischidia hahliana is well adapted to life on trees, where it uses its aerial roots to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the air and rain."
