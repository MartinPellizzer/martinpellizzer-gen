    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. marina, commonly known as sea bent grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, mat-forming growth pattern, which helps stabilize sandy or saline soils. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple. It is highly salt-tolerant and thrives in maritime environments, making it an important component of coastal vegetation. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it valuable for erosion control and habitat restoration in coastal areas."
