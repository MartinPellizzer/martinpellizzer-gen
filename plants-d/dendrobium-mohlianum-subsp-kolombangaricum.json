    "intro": "Dendrobium mohlianum subsp. kolombangaricum, commonly known as the Kolombangar orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often among ferns and other understory vegetation. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding survival in its humid, tropical habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
