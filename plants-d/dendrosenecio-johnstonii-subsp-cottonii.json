    "intro": "Dendrosenecio johnstonii subsp. cottonii, commonly known as the Cotton's tree heath, is a succulent shrub native to the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adaptations typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in winter, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in succulent gardens and conservation programs."
