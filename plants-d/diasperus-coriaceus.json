    "intro": "Diasperus coriaceus, commonly known as the rough stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Diasperus coriaceus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
