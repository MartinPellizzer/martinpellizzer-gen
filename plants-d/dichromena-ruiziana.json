    "intro": "Dichromena ruiziana, commonly known as the Ruiz's dichromena, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, and has opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with four petals, and it produces small, round berries that contain the seeds. Dichromena ruiziana is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
