    "intro": "Disocactus alatus, commonly known as the bat's wing cactus, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that resemble bat wings, which are often covered in white, fuzzy spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its distinctive appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
