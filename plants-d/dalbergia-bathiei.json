    "intro": "Dalbergia bathiei, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The tree produces hard, dark wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
