    "intro": "Dioon sonorense, commonly known as the Sonoran Dioon, is a rare and ancient cycad native to the Sonoran Desert of North America. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces both male and female cones, which are typically found on separate plants, a feature known as dioecious reproduction. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species."
