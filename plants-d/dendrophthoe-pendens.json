    "intro": "Dendrophthoe pendens, commonly known as the hanging or spider orchid, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, pendulous stems that often hang from trees, giving it its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures called phylloclades that perform photosynthesis. It attaches to host trees through haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host. Dendrophthoe pendens is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded, humid environments."
