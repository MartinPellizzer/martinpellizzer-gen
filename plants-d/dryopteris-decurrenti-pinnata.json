    "intro": "Dryopteris decurrenti-pinnata, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its fronds that have a decurrent (gradually tapering) shape, with pinnate (feather-like) divisions. The plant typically grows in rocky, shaded environments, often on cliffs or in forested areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and adaptable nature."
