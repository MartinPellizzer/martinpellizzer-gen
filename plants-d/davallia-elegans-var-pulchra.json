    "intro": "Davallia elegans var. pulchra, commonly known as the pink fern, is a striking variant of the fern species Davallia elegans. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that display a pale pink to reddish hue, distinguishing it from the typical green fronds of the parent species. This variety thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, creating a feathery appearance that enhances its ornamental value. It is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant or in shaded garden settings due to its elegant and unique foliage."
