    "intro": "Diplotaxis decumbens, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, spreading stems and narrow, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers that are followed by spherical, seed-filled capsules. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
