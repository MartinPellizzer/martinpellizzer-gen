    "intro": "Drosera adscendens, commonly known as the climbing sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its erect, often sprawling stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant features sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that secrete a dew-like substance to trap insects. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathland or swampy areas. Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptations make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
