    "intro": "Desmanthus natans, commonly known as the floating clover, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and ability to root along its nodes, allowing it to spread across water surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in wet or marshy environments. Desmanthus natans plays a role in stabilizing aquatic soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
