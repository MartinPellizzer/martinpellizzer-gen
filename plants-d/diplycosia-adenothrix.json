    "intro": "Diplycosia adenothrix, commonly known as the slender thorned vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Due to its thorny stems and rapid growth, it is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in certain areas."
