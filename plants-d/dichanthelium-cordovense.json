    "intro": "Dichanthelium cordovense, commonly known as the Cordovense Panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
