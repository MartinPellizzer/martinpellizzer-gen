    "intro": "Dalbergia brachystachya, commonly known as the yellow-heart wood or Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and fine grain, making it popular in the musical instrument and furniture industries. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
