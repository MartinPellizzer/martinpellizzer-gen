    "intro": "Desmodium laxum var. kiusianum, commonly known as the slender cowpea, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with stipules and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in racemes. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
