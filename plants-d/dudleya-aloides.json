    "intro": "Dudleya aloides, commonly known as the silver leaf Dudleya, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces striking clusters of pink or red flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and protected species in some areas."
