    "intro": "Delphinium andesicola, commonly known as the Andean larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, bearing clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, typical of many alpine species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its striking appearance and unique habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and gardeners alike."
