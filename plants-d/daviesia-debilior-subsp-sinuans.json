It typically grows in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
