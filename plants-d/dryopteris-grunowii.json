    "intro": "Dryopteris grunowii, commonly known as the Grunow's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
