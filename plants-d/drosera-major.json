    "intro": "Drosera major, commonly known as the large sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sweet-smelling mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are broad and rosette-shaped, with the adhesive secretions covering the surface. Drosera major produces small, greenish-white flowers during the spring and summer months."
