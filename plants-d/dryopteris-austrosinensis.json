    "intro": "Dryopteris austrosinensis, commonly known as the southern Chinese wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and large, bipinnate fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive serrated margin. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus."
