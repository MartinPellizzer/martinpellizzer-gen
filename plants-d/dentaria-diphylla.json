It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Its unique two-leaved structure and early blooming period make it a distinctive member of the Papaveraceae family. Dentaria diphylla is also noted for its medicinal properties, historically used by Native American tribes for various ailments."
