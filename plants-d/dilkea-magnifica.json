    "intro": "Dilkea magnifica, commonly known as the royal flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that display vibrant shades of red and orange, often with intricate patterns resembling flames. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and waxy, designed to retain water in its humid, shaded habitat. Dilkea magnifica is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its role in supporting local biodiversity."
