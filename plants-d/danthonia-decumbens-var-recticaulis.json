    "intro": "Danthonia decumbens var. recticaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mat grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
