It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring dense, compact foliage with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, blue-black berries.

Its botanical features include opposite leaves and a branching habit that contributes to its ornamental value."
