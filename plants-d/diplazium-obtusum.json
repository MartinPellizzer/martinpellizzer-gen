    "intro": "Diplazium obtusum, commonly known as the broad-leaved chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Diplazium obtusum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
