    "intro": "Digitaria mollissima, commonly known as silky fingergrass, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, soft, and silky foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikes, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Silky fingergrass is often found in wetland ecosystems and can serve as a food source for various wildlife species."
