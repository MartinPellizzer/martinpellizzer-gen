    "intro": "Dendrobium albicolor, commonly known as the white-lipped dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking white flowers with yellow-green markings, which bloom during the rainy season. Its stems are typically clustered and can grow up to several feet in length. Dendrobium albicolor is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
