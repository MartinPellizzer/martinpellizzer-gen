    "intro": "Dendrobium hkinhumense, commonly known as the Hkinhumense orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Thailand and Malaysia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in a dense coating of fine hairs. Its flowers are typically small, clustered in spikes, and come in shades of white, yellow, and green. Dendrobium hkinhumense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
