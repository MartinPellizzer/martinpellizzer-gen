    "intro": "Dracaena afromontana, commonly known as the Ethiopian dracaena, is a species native to the highland regions of Ethiopia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. Its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
