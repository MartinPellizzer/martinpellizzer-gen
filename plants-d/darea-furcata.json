    "intro": "Darea furcata, commonly known as the forked liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a distinctive forked or branched growth pattern, which gives it its common name. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, undifferentiated body called a thallus. Darea furcata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
