    "intro": "Diplazium extensum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Diplazium extensum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks."
