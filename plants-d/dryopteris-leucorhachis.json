It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are covered in fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Dryopteris leucorhachis is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
