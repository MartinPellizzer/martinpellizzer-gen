    "intro": "Diplonyx, commonly known as the starry nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to southern Africa, where they thrive in a variety of habitats. The plants are characterized by their showy, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or blue. Diplonyx species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking appearance and ability to attract pollinators. However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, they contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
