It is a small, herbaceous species characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a single umbel at the end of its stem. It thrives in arctic and alpine environments, often found on rocky slopes and gravelly soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude regions."
