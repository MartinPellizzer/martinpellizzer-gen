    "intro": "Datura floribunda, commonly known as the desert thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Datura floribunda is known for its toxic properties, containing tropane alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals."
