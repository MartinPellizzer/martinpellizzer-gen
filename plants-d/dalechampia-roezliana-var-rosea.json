    "intro": "Dalechampia roezliana var. rosea, commonly known as the pink giant hogweed, is a striking plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, with a velvety texture and a distinctive reddish-brown underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers arranged in an inflorescence that resembles a crown, blooming during the rainy season. Its stems are thick and hollow, often covered in fine hairs, and it can reach heights of up to 3 meters. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal but requires careful cultivation due to its vigorous growth habit."
