It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant produces spore-bearing fertile fronds with a distinctive, narrow shape and a serrated edge. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round interest in woodland gardens."
