    "intro": "Dryopteris neochrysocoma, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a slight golden hue on the underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
