    "intro": "Dendrophthoe buddleioides, commonly known as the ghost flower or parasitic orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a hemiparasitic species that attaches to the roots of other plants, drawing water and nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a ghostly appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique parasitic nature and delicate floral structure, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
