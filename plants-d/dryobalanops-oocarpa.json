    "intro": "Dryobalanops oocarpa, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, heavy timber that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree has a straight trunk with a broad, spreading crown and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and yellowish, arranged in clusters, and it produces large, woody fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its slow growth and high commercial value, it is also considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
