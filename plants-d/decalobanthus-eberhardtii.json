    "intro": "Decalobanthus eberhardtii, commonly known as the Eberhardt's decalobanthus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with cool climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
