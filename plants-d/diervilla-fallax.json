    "intro": "Diervilla fallax, commonly known as the fallax hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible, nut-like fruits that are encased in a spiny husk. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Diervilla fallax is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
