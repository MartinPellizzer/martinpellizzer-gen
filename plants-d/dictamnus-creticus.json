    "intro": "Dictamnus creticus, commonly known as the Cretan dictamnus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark that exudes a strong, pleasant scent when broken. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Dictamnus creticus is often found in rocky or limestone soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in perfumery."
