    "intro": "Dyckia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly Dyckia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it its common name. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grayish-green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. It produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. Dyckia tomentosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
