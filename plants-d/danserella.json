    "intro": "Danserella, commonly known as the \"butterfly orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to various regions in South America, particularly Brazil, and are known for their delicate, butterfly-like flowers. The leaves of Danserella are typically narrow and grass-like, while the inflorescence consists of a spike bearing small, fragrant blooms. They thrive in humid, shaded environments and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
