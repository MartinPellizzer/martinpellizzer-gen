    "intro": "Diplycosia atjehensis, commonly known as the Atjeh mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized roots. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind, contributing to its propagation in forested areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
