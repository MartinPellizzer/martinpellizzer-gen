    "intro": "Dryopteris subspinosa var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The spores are released from small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds."
