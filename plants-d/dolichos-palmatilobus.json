    "intro": "Dolichos palmatilobus, commonly known as the broad-lobed dolichos, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa. It features compound leaves with broad, lobed leaflets that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, followed by pod fruits containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
