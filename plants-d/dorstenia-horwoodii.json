    "intro": "Dorstenia horwoodii, commonly known as the horwoodii fig-leaf plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to eastern Africa, particularly Tanzania, and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
