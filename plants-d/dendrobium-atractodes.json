    "intro": "Dendrobium atractodes, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually purple or violet, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. Dendrobium atractodes thrives in humid, tropical climates with bright, indirect light."
