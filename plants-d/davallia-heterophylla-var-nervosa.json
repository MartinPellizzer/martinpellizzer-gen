    "intro": "Davallia heterophylla var. nervosa, commonly known as the veined shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies. Its rhizomes are wiry and often covered with a layer of brownish, hairy tissue. The varietal form, nervosa, is distinguished by its finely veined leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance."
