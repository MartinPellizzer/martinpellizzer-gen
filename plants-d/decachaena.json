    "intro": "Decachaena, commonly known as the golden cup, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky environments. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow to orange flowers, which resemble small cups, hence its common name. Decachaena species typically have narrow, linear leaves and produce small, daisy-like blooms. These plants are often used in rock gardens and are valued for their ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
