    "intro": "Deschampsia flexuosa f. argentea, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a variant of the common hairgrass species. It is characterized by its silver-white to greyish foliage, which results from dense, silky pubescence covering the leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. It forms dense, low-growing clumps with slender, wiry stems that often arch or curl. The inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with green or brown."
