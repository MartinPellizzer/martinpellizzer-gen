    "intro": "Dryopteris nigrescens, commonly known as the black-stemmed wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark, wiry fronds that often turn a deep brownish-black as they mature. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
