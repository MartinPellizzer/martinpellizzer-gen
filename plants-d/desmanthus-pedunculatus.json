    "intro": "Desmanthus pedunculatus, commonly known as the slender desmanthus, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces elliptical, seed-coated pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Desmanthus pedunculatus is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and potential use in forage and erosion control."
