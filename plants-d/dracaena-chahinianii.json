It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that are often variegated with yellow and white markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Dracaena chahinianii thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to bright indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.
