    "intro": "Dracophyllum \u00d7 insulare, commonly known as the coastal driftable heath, is a hybrid shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing form and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it a resilient plant in coastal ecosystems. Dracophyllum \u00d7 insulare plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various small invertebrates and birds."
