It is characterized by its elongated, leafy shoots and distinct, often serrated leaf margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its sporophytes are usually short and produce a single, elongated capsule that is often curved. Dicranopygium fissile plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
