    "intro": "Dioscorea platycolpota, commonly known as the flat-ribbed yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into cylindrical fruits. Its tubers are similar in appearance to other yam species but are less commonly cultivated for food. The botanical features of D. platycolpota make it an important plant in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
