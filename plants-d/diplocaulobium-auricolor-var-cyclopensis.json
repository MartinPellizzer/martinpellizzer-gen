    "intro": "Diplocaulobium auricolor var. cyclopensis, commonly known as the golden-eyed cyclopensis, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow inflorescences, which are highly distinctive and attract various pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as mountainous forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are lanceolate and emit a subtle fragrance, contributing to its ecological role in the local flora. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
