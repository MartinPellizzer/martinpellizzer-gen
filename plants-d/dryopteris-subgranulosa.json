    "intro": "Dryopteris subgranulosa, commonly known as the granular wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive granular texture on the underside, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are essential for its reproductive cycle."
