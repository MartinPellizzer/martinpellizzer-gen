    "intro": "Delphinium halteratum var. macropetalum, commonly known as the giant blue delphinium, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, supporting large, showy blue to purple flowers. The flowers are arranged in dense spikes and feature prominent, spurred petals that are typical of the Delphinium genus. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny soils. However, it is toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of alkaloids in its foliage and flowers."
