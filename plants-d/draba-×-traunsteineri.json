    "intro": "Draba \u00d7 traunsteineri, commonly known as the Traunsteiner's whitlow grass, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, resembling those of other Draba species. It is native to Europe and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
