    "intro": "Dipyrena scoparia, commonly known as the creeping dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are typically basal, oblanceolate, and have a rough texture with a slightly hairy surface. Dipyrena scoparia is commonly found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
