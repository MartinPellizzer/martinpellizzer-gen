    "intro": "Diplazium wichurae var. parawichurae, commonly known as the Parawichura's water fern, is a variant of the Diplazium genus, which belongs to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain light conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing for vegetative propagation. This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
