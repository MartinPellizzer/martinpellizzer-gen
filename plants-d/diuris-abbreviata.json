    "intro": "Diuris abbreviata, commonly known as the small-lobed spider-orchid, is an Australian native orchid species characterized by its compact, hairy growth habit and distinctive floral structure. It typically features a single, narrow leaf and produces a raceme of small, spider-like flowers with prominent sepals and petals. The flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a contrasting lip that is often darker. This species is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils in heathland and woodland environments. It is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and is often found in the southern regions of Western Australia."
