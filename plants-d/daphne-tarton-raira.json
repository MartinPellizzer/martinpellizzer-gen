It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the island's unique climate. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
