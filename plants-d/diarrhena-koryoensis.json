    "intro": "Diarrhena koryoensis, commonly known as the Korean Diarrhena, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North Korea. It belongs to the family Diarrheneaceae and is characterized by its delicate, small white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and wiry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species with conservation efforts underway to protect its natural habitat."
