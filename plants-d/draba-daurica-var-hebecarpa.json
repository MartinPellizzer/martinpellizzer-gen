    "intro": "Draba daurica var. hebecarpa, commonly known as the Daurian rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, basal leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring, which are arranged in tight, compact inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
