    "intro": "Diplectria glabra var. kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Bornean flatleaf fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found in the high-altitude regions of Borneo. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are typically glabrous, or smooth to the touch. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates in montane forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss and limited study, the species remains poorly understood in terms of its ecological role and reproductive biology."
