The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in sunny locations and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
