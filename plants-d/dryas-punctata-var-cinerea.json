    "intro": "Dryas punctata var. cinerea, commonly known as the gray dryas, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silvery-gray foliage, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and subalpine habitats. Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
