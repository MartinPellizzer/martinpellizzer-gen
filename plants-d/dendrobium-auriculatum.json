    "intro": "Dendrobium auriculatum, commonly known as the ear-shaped orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive ear-like shape on the petals. It prefers well-draining soil and indirect sunlight, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique appearance and relatively easy care make it a favored ornamental plant among orchid enthusiasts."
