    "intro": "Didymocarpus grandifolius, commonly known as the large-leafed didymocarp, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
