    "intro": "Drepanostachyum melicoideum, commonly known as the giant bamboo, is a tall, perennial grass native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, hollow stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, making it one of the tallest grasses in the world. The plant has long, narrow leaves with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its humid environment. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often surrounded by bracts. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional construction and as a source of fiber."
