    "intro": "Dendrobium flexile, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features a unique spiral growth pattern in its stems, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow with red or purple markings. Dendrobium flexile thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
