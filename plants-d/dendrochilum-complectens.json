    "intro": "Dendrochilum complectens, commonly known as the entwined forest orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. The plant produces strikingly beautiful, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, often with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water and nutrients, adapting it to its humid, shaded habitat. Dendrochilum complectens thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and is often found in mountainous regions."
