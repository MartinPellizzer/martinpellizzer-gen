    "intro": "Dendrobium lamii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters along its upright, branched stems. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat with limited rainfall. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Dendrobium lamii prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
