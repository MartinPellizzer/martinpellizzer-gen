    "intro": "Draba frigida var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous frostweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact rosette of dark green, glabrous (hairless) leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in rocky or sandy soils. This variety is notable for its hibernating seed strategy, where seeds remain dormant for several years before germinating under favorable conditions."
