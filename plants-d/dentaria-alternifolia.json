    "intro": "Dentaria alternifolia, commonly known as the alternate-leaved toothplant, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its alternate arrangement of leaves, which are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the emergence of leaves. Its root system is fibrous and contains compounds that have been used in traditional herbal medicine. Dentaria alternifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
