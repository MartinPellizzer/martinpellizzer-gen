    "intro": "Dryopteris banajaoensis, commonly known as the Banaja fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the growth of its upright, dichotomous fronds. This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted geographic distribution."
