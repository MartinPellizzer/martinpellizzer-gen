    "intro": "Dryopteris subcuspidata, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape that gives it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense clumps. Its foliage is typically bright green, with a slightly glossy appearance, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This fern is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
