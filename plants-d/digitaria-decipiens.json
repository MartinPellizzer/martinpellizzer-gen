    "intro": "Digitaria decipiens, commonly known as the false brome, is a grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Digitaria decipiens thrives in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, and it is often found in moist or wet habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
