    "intro": "Delphinium albocoeruleum var. przewalskii, commonly known as the Przewalski's blue delphinium, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy flowers that are typically blue or sky-blue in color. The plant produces numerous spurred petals and has a distinctive, somewhat woolly appearance due to its hairy leaves and stems. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tibetan Plateau. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
