    "intro": "Dendrobium jinghuanum, commonly known as the Jinghuan orchid, is a species of orchid native to China, particularly in the Yunnan Province. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, which help it survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns and a strong fragrance. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
