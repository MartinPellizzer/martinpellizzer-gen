    "intro": "Dryopteris cambrensis subsp. distans, commonly known as the Welsh wood fern, is a fern species native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
