    "intro": "Draba neomexicana, commonly known as New Mexico rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. This species is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, basal leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. Draba neomexicana typically thrives in rocky soils and arid environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a food source for various pollinators and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh climates."
