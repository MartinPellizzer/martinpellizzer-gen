    "intro": "Dendrobium singkawangense, commonly known as the Singkawang orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Borneo. It is an epiphytic orchid that thrives in the humid, tropical rainforests of the region. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
