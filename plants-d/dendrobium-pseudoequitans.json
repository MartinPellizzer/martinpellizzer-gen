    "intro": "Dendrobium pseudoequitans, commonly known as the horsehead orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, branching structure with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, lance-shaped flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining, aerated soil. Dendrobium pseudoequitans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
