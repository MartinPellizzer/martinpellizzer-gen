    "intro": "Drapetes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with white or pale pink flowers that resemble a ghostly figure. The plant lacks traditional leaves and instead has a single, slender stem that supports its showy blooms. Drapetes is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
