    "intro": "Dryopteris parathelypteris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and releasing spores in the autumn."
