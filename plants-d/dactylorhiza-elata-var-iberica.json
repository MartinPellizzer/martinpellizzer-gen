    "intro": "Dactylorhiza elata var. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in nutrient-poor soils. It has a complex root system and is often found in association with other wetland plants. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
