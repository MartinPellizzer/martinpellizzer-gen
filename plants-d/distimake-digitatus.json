    "intro": "Distimake digitatus, commonly known as the fingerleaf fern, is a perennial plant native to tropical regions. It features delicate, feather-like fronds that spread horizontally, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Its unique leaf structure makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
