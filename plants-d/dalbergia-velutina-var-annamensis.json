    "intro": "Dalbergia velutina var. annamensis, commonly known as Annam rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam and Laos. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, reddish-brown color and a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a velvety texture on the underside. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, oblong seeds. This species is valued for its high-quality timber but is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
