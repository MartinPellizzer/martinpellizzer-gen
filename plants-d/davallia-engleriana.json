    "intro": "Davallia engleriana, commonly known as the Engler's serrate holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives on rocky or shaded soil. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the ground. The spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
