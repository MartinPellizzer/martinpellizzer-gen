    "intro": "Dendrobium laciniosum, commonly known as the lace-leaf dendrobium, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, wiry stems that can become woody over time, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral. It produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, often with intricate patterns. Dendrobium laciniosum is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in greenhouses and gardens."
