    "intro": "Denisophytum rosei, commonly known as the roseleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, with bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Denisophytum rosei is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
