    "intro": "Drosera neesii subsp. borealis, commonly known as the northern sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a dense inflorescence, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with limited nutrient availability."
