    "intro": "Deparia florensiae, commonly known as the Flores fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically adorned with intricate sori on the underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered and covered by a protective indusium. Deparia florensiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
