    "intro": "Dryopteris filix-mas subsp. kingii, commonly known as the King's shield fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust fronds and a slightly different leaf shape compared to the typical filix-mas."
