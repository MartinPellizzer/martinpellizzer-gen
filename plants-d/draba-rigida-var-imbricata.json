    "intro": "Draba rigida var. imbricata, commonly known as the rigid whitlowgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has basal leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. Draba rigida var. imbricata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing early-season nectar for pollinators."
