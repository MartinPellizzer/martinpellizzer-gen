    "intro": "Daphnopsis guacacoa, commonly known as the Guacacoa, is a rare and little-studied plant species native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with partial shade. Its botanical features include dark green, leathery leaves and bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to habitat loss and limited research, Daphnopsis guacacoa remains a poorly understood species within its native ecosystem."
