    "intro": "Daucus montanus, commonly known as the mountain carrot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like parsley and dill. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in umbels. Its root system is fibrous and not typically cultivated for food, but it is valued for its ornamental appeal. Daucus montanus thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cooler, high-altitude environments."
