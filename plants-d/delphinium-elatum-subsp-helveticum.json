    "intro": "Delphinium elatum subsp. helveticum, commonly known as the Swiss larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, showy blue to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, with a hairy texture that aids in water retention. This subspecies is adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its striking floral display makes it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements."
