    "intro": "Doronicum malvifolium, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive violet or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are typically clustered in racemes and are adapted for pollination by insects. Doronicum malvifolium thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas."
