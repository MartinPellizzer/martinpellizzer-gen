    "intro": "Dryopteris spinulosa subsp. dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with spiny structures along the pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium."
