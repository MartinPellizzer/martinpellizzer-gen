    "intro": "Deckera asplenoides, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to southern Africa. It features a compact, upright growth habit with dark green, leathery, shield-shaped leaves that are often adorned with silvery-white veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is well-suited for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor landscaping."
