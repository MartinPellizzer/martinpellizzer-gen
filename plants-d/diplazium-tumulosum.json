    "intro": "Diplazium tumulosum, commonly known as the clustered sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit. The plant features long, narrow, serrated fronds that arise from a short, rhizomatous stem. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Diplazium tumulosum is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive appearance and hardiness."
