    "intro": "Dendrophorbium curvidens, commonly known as the spiral-stemmed orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique spiraling growth pattern, which gives it a distinctive appearance and aids in its structural stability in wind-swept environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted to minimize water loss in its arid habitat. Dendrophorbium curvidens is primarily found growing on rocky outcrops and cliffs, where it relies on specific microclimates for survival."
