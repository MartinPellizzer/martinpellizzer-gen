    "intro": "Dasispermum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, spiny capsule, which aids in seed dispersal. Dasispermum is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions."
