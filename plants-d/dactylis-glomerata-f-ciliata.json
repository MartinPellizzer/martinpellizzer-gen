    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata f. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy grass or ciliate sheep's fescue, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is characterized by its hairy leaves and stems, which distinguish it from the typical form of Dactylis glomerata. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in temperate climates. It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a useful species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
