    "intro": "Diasperus villosus, commonly known as the hairy sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize surface area and conserve moisture. Diasperus villosus is often found in sandy soils and is a common species in coastal and inland dunes."
