    "intro": "Dryopteris odontoloma, commonly known as the toothed wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments with toothed margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the environment."
