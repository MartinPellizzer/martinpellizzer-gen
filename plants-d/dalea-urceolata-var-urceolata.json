    "intro": "Dalea urceolata var. urceolata, commonly known as the bottlebrush milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its unique, bottle-shaped seed pods and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. It produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its morphology and growth habits make it well adapted to drought conditions and poor soil environments."
