It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
