The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its unique floral structure includes five petals and stamens that are arranged in a spiral pattern. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
