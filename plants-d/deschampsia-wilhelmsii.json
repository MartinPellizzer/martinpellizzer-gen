    "intro": "Deschampsia wilhelmsii, commonly known as Wilhelms' feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features slender, hairless stems that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces feathery, silver-green inflorescences that are characteristic of the Deschampsia genus. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in cooler climates."
