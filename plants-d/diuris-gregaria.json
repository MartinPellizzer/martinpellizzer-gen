    "intro": "Diuris gregaria, commonly known as the clustered spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded conditions. The plant produces a compact cluster of up to 20 flower spikes, each bearing small, spider-like flowers with dark brown or purple markings. Its flowering period occurs during late winter to early spring, and it is known for its striking, intricate floral structure. Diuris gregaria is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological significance in its native habitat."
