    "intro": "Dichapetalum thomsonii var. obanense, commonly known as the Oban dwarf larkspur, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Scotland. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowers are typically arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or grassy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
