    "intro": "Drimophyllum, commonly known as the \"cork tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, often with a rough, cork-like texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Drimophyllum species are native to regions of southern Africa and are often found in dry, rocky habitats. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and their ability to thrive in arid environments."
