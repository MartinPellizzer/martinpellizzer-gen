    "intro": "Dendrolirium secundum, commonly known as the secondary tree lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are long and narrow, arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces showy, bell-shaped blooms that attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dendrolirium secundum is considered a rare and endangered species."
