    "intro": "Dunalia breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered dunalia, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical leguminous features. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in southern Africa. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are often pale blue or purple in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system. Dunalia breviflora is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in disturbed or sandy habitats."
