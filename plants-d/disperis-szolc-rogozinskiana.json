    "intro": "Disperis szolc-rogozinskiana, commonly known as the Szolc-Rogozinska orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers with intricate petal structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, while its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish with a distinct lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
