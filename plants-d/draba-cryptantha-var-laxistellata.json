    "intro": "Draba cryptantha var. laxistellata, commonly known as the slender-flowered rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette and are covered in a fine layer of hairs. This variant is distinguished by its more lax inflorescence compared to the typical form of Draba cryptantha."
