    "intro": "Draba wahlenbergii f. heterotricha, commonly known as the alpine winter cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in alpine and arctic regions, characterized by its compact stature and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in cold climates. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes."
