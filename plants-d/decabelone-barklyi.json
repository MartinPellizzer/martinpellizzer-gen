    "intro": "Decabelone barklyi, commonly known as the barklyi orchid, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple petals and a tall, slender stem that supports its delicate blooms. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky crevices or among moss-covered substrates. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring, producing a fragrant aroma that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Decabelone barklyi is considered a conservation concern."
