    "intro": "Dryopteris henriquesii, commonly known as the Henriques' wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The fronds are typically divided into a series of lance-shaped segments, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
