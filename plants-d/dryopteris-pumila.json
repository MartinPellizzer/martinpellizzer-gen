    "intro": "Dryopteris pumila, commonly known as the rock fern or dwarf shield fern, is a small, low-growing fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices, woodlands, and stream banks. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that form a dense, carpet-like ground cover. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Dryopteris pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or eroded areas."
