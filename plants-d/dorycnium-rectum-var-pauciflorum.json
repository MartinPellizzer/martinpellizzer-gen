    "intro": "Dorycnium rectum var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the lesser sainfoin, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings to improve soil fertility."
