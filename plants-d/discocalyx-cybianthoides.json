It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, a feature common in the Apiaceae family, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Discocalyx cybianthoides is often found in open habitats such as plains, woodlands, and along roadsides."
