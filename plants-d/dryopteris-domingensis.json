    "intro": "Dryopteris domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it in soil while also supporting its growth in rocky or clay-rich substrates. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings for its unique foliage."
