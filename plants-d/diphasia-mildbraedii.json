    "intro": "Diphasia mildbraedii, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a range of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are evergreen, and it produces showy inflorescences that bloom in spring. The Cape tulip is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
