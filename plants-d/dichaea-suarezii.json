    "intro": "Dichaea suarezii, commonly known as the Suarez's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with showy red flowers, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Its unique structure allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments where it can absorb moisture from the air. Due to its ornamental value and limited habitat, Dichaea suarezii is considered a rare and endangered species."
