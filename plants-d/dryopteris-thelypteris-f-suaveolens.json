    "intro": "Dryopteris thelypteris f. suaveolens, commonly known as the fragrant shield fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in woodland areas and along stream banks. The leaves emit a subtle, pleasant aroma when crushed, contributing to its common name. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
