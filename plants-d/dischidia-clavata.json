    "intro": "Dischidia clavata, commonly known as the Clavate Dischidia, is a climbing or trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellowish-green with a reddish tint, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements. Dischidia clavata thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity."
