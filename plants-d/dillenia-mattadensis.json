    "intro": "Dillenia mattadensis, commonly known as the mountain dillenia, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a small tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers with prominent stamens, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture with serrated edges. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
