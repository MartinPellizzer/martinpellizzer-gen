    "intro": "Desmoncus horridus subsp. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate horrid desmoncus, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, white, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, often with a slightly hairy surface. This subspecies is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
