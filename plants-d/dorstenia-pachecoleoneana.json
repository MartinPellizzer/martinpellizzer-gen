    "intro": "Dorstenia pachecoleoneana, commonly known as the Pacheco's woolly knotweed, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its unique, spiraling inflorescence and hairy, fleshy stems that help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms. Its leaves are often lobed and covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
