    "intro": "Draba tibetica var. sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim Draba, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows at high elevations, often in rocky or gravelly soils. It has basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces numerous small white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
