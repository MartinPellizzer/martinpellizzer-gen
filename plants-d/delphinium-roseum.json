    "intro": "Delphinium roseum, commonly known as the rose-flowered larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of showy, rose-pink to lavender-blue flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically arranged in racemes and bloom in late spring to early summer. Delphinium roseum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, delicate blooms."
