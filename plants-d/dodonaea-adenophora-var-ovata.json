    "intro": "Dodonaea adenophora var. ovata, commonly known as the velvetleaf Dodonaea, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but can become invasive in certain environments."
