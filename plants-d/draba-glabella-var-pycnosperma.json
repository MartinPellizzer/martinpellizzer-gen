    "intro": "Draba glabella var. pycnosperma, commonly known as the dense-seeded whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are characteristic of the Brassicaceae family. Its seeds are notably compact and numerous, aiding in its ability to colonize disturbed or barren soils. This variety is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting cold tolerance and efficient water use strategies."
