    "intro": "Drosera communis var. breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to South Africa. It features hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its small, white flowers are arranged in a dense cluster and bloom during the summer months. The variety is distinguished by its shorter stems and compact growth habit compared to other Drosera species."
