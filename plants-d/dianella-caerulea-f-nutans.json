    "intro": "Dianella caerulea f. nutans, commonly known as the drooping flax lily, is a compact, evergreen perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are dark green and often have a bluish tinge. The plant produces striking, blue to violet flowers in dense, drooping clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its elegant foliage and long-lasting, showy inflorescences."
