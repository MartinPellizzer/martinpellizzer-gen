It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are usually three-lobed and have a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The tubers are valued for their starchy texture and are used in various traditional cuisines."
