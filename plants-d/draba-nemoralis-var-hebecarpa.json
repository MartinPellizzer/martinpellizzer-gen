    "intro": "Draba nemoralis var. hebecarpa, commonly known as the slender rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize water loss in harsh environments. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate cold temperatures and poor soil conditions, making it a characteristic component of high-altitude vegetation."
