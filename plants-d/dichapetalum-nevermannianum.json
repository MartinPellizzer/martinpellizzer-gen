    "intro": "Dichapetalum nevermannianum, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a woody stem and thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters and bloom during the cooler months. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique nighttime blooming habit."
