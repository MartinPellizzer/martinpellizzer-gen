    "intro": "Dupatya roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the tepuis of southern Venezuela and northern Brazil. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in the nutrient-poor soils of the highland regions, adapting to the unique microclimates of these isolated mountain tops. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense clusters near rocky outcrops. The species is of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary adaptations and limited distribution."
