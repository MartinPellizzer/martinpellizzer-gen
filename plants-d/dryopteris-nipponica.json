    "intro": "Dryopteris nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Dryopteris nipponica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
