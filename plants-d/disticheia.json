    "intro": "Disticheia, commonly known as the two-rowed grass, is a type of grass characterized by its distinct two rows of leaves on either side of the stem. It is typically found in temperate regions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Disticheia is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. Its growth habit makes it suitable for use in lawns, borders, and as a ground cover."
