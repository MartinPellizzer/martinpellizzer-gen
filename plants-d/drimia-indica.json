    "intro": "Drimia indica, commonly known as the African lily, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and striking white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps. Drimia indica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
