It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its flowers are typically visited by various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
