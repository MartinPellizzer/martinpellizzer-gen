    "intro": "Dillwynia, commonly known as the honeycomb bush, is a genus of flowering plants native to Australia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered flowers that resemble a honeycomb. The plants typically have small, narrow leaves and produce yellow or white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dillwynia species are often found in dry, sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
