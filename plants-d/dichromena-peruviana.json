It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive two-colored flowers, which typically display contrasting hues of red and blue. The plant features palmate leaves with lobed margins, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories.
