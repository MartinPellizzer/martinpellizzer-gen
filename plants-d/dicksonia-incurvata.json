    "intro": "Dicksonia incurvata, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, drooping fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are typically dark green with a silvery underside, which contributes to its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a significant role in New Zealand's native flora."
