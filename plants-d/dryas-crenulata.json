    "intro": "Dryas crenulata, commonly known as the alpine avens, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cold, alpine environments and is often found in rocky soils at high elevations. It is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions and has a slow growth rate. Dryas crenulata plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
