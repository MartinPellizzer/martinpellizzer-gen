    "intro": "Dactylorhiza kalopissii f. macedonica, commonly known as the Macedonian marsh orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Balkans. It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, stocky rhizome and produces a single, erect stem bearing several lance-shaped leaves. The plant flowers with a single, showy violet or purple spike, adorned with small, hooded flowers that have a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and peat bogs, requiring specific moisture and nutrient conditions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in many regions."
