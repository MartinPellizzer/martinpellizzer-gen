    "intro": "Deanea diffusa, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by spherical, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Deanea diffusa is also known for its ability to climb and spread rapidly, making it both a useful and sometimes invasive species."
