    "intro": "Dentaria savensis, commonly known as the swamp dentaria, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, toothed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are typically arranged in a loose raceme. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, swampy soils. Dentaria savensis is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
