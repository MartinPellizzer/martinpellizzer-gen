    "intro": "Dryopteris lanuginosa, commonly known as the downy wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, fuzzy appearance, with fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Dryopteris lanuginosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
