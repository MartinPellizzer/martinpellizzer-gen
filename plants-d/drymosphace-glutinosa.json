    "intro": "Drymosphace glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky tree or gum tree, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sticky, resinous sap, which exudes from its bark and leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, lowland areas and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture. The flowers are small and clustered, producing a fragrant, yellowish-green color that attracts pollinators."
