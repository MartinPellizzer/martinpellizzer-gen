    "intro": "Delphinium magnificum, commonly known as the magnificent larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, adorned with clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and pets."
