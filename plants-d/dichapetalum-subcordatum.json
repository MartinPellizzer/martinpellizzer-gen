    "intro": "Dichapetalum subcordatum, commonly known as the African candlewood, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape with a slightly wavy margin. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or wooded areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
