    "intro": "Dryostachyum pilosum, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical panicle, and it produces small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Dryostachyum pilosum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
