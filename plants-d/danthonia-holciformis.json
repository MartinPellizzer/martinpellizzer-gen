    "intro": "Danthonia holciformis, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, silver-green leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Danthonia holciformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
