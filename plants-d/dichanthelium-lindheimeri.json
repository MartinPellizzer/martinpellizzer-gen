    "intro": "Dichanthelium lindheimeri, commonly known as Lindheimer's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are often wind-pollinated. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense stands. Botanically, it is part of the Poaceae family and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
