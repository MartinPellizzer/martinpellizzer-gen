    "intro": "Dactyloctenium mucronatum var. erectum, commonly known as the upright fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. It is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in degraded habitats."
