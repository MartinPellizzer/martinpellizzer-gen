    "intro": "Diplolabellum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a lithophytic species, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in humid, shaded environments. The plant has thin, wiry roots and produces delicate, white or greenish-white flowers with a unique labellum structure. It is known for its difficulty in cultivation due to specific environmental requirements. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and its status as an indicator of healthy, undisturbed habitats."
