    "intro": "Detris ericifolia var. anthemidodes, commonly known as the flowering heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. This variety is closely related to other members of the Ericaceae family, known for their adaptability to harsh conditions."
