    "intro": "Didyplosandra, commonly known as the golden torch tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to South Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and dense, rounded crown. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called cyathia, which are surrounded by vibrant green bracts. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a waxy texture, and it thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Didyplosandra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for local wildlife."
