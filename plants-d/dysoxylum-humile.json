    "intro": "Dysoxylum humile, commonly known as the small dysoxylum, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
