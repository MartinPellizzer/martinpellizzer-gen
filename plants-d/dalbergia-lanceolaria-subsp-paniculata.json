    "intro": "Dalbergia lanceolaria subsp. paniculata, commonly known as the paniculate rosewood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with small, elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in paniculate inflorescences. Its wood is highly valued for its dense, dark color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions."
