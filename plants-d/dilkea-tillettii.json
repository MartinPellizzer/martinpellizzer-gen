    "intro": "Dilkea tillettii, commonly known as the Tiltlet's lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Iridaceae family, which includes many ornamental and economically important flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense rosette at the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dilkea tillettii is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its natural environment."
