    "intro": "Drymaria cordata var. diandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, succulent leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to withstand dry and sandy conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
