    "intro": "Dendrobium quinquelobum, commonly known as the five-lobed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with its stems forming horizontal or pendant clusters. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with five distinct lobes that give it its common name. Dendrobium quinquelobum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beauty and fragrance."
