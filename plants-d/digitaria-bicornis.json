    "intro": "Digitaria bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as pastures and disturbed sites. Digitaria bicornis is valued for its role in erosion control and as forage for livestock."
