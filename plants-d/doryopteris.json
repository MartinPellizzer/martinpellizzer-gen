It typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plants have a creeping rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that are often evergreen. The fronds are usually leathery and have a distinctive, serrated or lobed appearance. Doryopteris species are valued for their ornamental qualities and are often cultivated in rock gardens or as ground covers."
