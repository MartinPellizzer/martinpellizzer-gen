    "intro": "Dendrobium coccineum, commonly known as the red-leaved dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant features a tall, cane-like stem that can reach up to 3 meters in height. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, while its flowers are strikingly red or orange with a white throat. Dendrobium coccineum blooms in summer and is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture."
