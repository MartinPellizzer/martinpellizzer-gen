    "intro": "Dalea comosa, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Dalea comosa plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria."
