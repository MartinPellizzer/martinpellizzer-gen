    "intro": "Dryopteris oreocharis, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. This species plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's native ecosystems."
