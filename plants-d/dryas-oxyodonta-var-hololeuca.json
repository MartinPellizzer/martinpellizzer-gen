    "intro": "Dryas oxyodonta var. hololeuca, commonly known as the white dryas, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. This variant is distinguished by its entirely white flowers, contrasting with the pink or red flowers of the typical variety."
