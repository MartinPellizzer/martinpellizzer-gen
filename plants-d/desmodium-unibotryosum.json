    "intro": "Desmodium unibotryosum, commonly known as the one-seed ticktrefoil, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval to heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical or cylindrical heads, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Desmodium unibotryosum is often found in open woodlands and prairies, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation."
