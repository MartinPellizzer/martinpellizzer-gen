    "intro": "Dicksonia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, frond-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, hollow stem that is covered in a fibrous, spongy material. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, emitting a faint blue glow. This unique feature makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and a subject of scientific interest."
