It features trifoliate leaves with narrow, elongated leaflets and produces small, fluffy, yellowish inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root system. This plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop."
