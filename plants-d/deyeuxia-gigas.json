    "intro": "Deyeuxia gigas, commonly known as the giant tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, robust stems and dense, tufted growth habit, which forms large clumps or tussocks. The plant produces spikelets that are usually borne in clusters, with small, narrow leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Deyeuxia gigas plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
