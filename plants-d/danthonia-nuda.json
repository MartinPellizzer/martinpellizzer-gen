    "intro": "Danthonia nuda, commonly known as the naked danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Danthonia nuda thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
