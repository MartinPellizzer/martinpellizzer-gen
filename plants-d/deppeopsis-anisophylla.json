    "intro": "Deppeopsis anisophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed daisies, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white to pale blue petals. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
