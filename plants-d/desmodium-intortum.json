    "intro": "Desmodium intortum, commonly known as curly top sicklepod, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its twisted, coiled stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, followed by cylindrical, woody pods that contain several kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along creek banks. Due to its invasive nature, it can compete with native vegetation and is considered a weed in some regions."
