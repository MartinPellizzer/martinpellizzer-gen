    "intro": "Dracocephalum tanguticum var. cinereum, commonly known as blackhead betony, is a perennial herb native to the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions of China. It is characterized by its dark purple to black stems and leaves, which contribute to its striking appearance. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and herbal collections."
