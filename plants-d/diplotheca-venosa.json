    "intro": "Diplotheca venosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf shrub, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by distinctive, ribbed, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
