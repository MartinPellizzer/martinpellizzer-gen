    "intro": "Dorycnium elongatum, commonly known as the slender burr vetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by distinctive, hooked burrs that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Dorycnium elongatum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
