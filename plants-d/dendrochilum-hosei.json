    "intro": "Dendrochilum hosei, commonly known as the Hosen's tree orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with purple or red markings. Its pseudobulbs and linear leaves are adapted to its epiphytic lifestyle, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Dendrochilum hosei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
