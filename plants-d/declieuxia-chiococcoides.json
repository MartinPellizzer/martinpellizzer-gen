    "intro": "Declieuxia chiococcoides, commonly known as the golden star grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to parts of Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive golden hue, especially under certain lighting conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscaped areas."
