    "intro": "Drymonia poeppigiana, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy blooms. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Drymonia poeppigiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
