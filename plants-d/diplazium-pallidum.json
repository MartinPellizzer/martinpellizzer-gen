    "intro": "Diplazium pallidum, commonly known as the pale fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Diplazium pallidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
