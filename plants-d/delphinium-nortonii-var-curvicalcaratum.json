    "intro": "Delphinium nortonii var. curvicalcaratum, commonly known as the bent-caps delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple spires of flowers in late summer, which are composed of numerous small, petal-like sepals. Its leaves are palmately compound, with lobed divisions that are often hairy and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental value in gardens and its ecological importance as a food source for specific pollinators."
