It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in a bluish waxy coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the tips of the branches. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy texture. Dichostemma glaucescens is known for its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
