    "intro": "Distichorchis nabawanensis, commonly known as the Nabawan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and growth habits. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, forested environments. Its flowers are small, often white or pale in color, and are arranged in a distinctive two-row pattern along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
