    "intro": "Dryopteris peltata, commonly known as the barren sword fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are deciduous, with a distinctive pinnate structure that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
