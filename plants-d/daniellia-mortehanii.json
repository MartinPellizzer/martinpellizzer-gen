    "intro": "Daniellia mortehanii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its straight, heavy timber with a fine grain and a reddish-brown color. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth margin. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, winged seeds. Due to its valuable wood, it is often harvested for commercial use, leading to concerns about its conservation status."
