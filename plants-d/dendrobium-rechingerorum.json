It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with its stems forming a rosette-like structure. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive, intricate pattern on the petals and sepals. It prefers warm, humid environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
