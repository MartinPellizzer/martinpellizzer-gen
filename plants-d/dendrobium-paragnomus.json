    "intro": "Dendrobium paragnomus, commonly known as the purple-tinged dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and purple. The plant has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Dendrobium paragnomus thrives in warm, humid climates with bright, indirect light."
