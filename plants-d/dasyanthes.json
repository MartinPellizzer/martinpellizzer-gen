These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline environments. They have succulent leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Dasyanthes species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging coastal conditions. Their root systems help stabilize sandy soils, making them ecologically significant in coastal ecosystems."
