    "intro": "Dysoxylum sericiflorum, commonly known as the silky-flowered dysoxylum, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it its common name. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. This species is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses."
