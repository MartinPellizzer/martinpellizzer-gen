    "intro": "Dioscorea villosa subsp. glauca, commonly known as wild yam, is a perennial vine native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by tuberous roots that are rich in compounds like diosgenin. These roots are often used in traditional medicine and as a source for steroid hormone synthesis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in woodland areas."
