    "intro": "Draba reptans f. hunteri, commonly known as the Hunter's rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to extreme climates and is often used in rock gardens or alpine landscapes."
