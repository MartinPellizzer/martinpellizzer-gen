    "intro": "Dyckia gableana, commonly known as the Gable's Dyckia, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a tight, water-holding cup at the center. The plant produces striking, inflorescences of red or orange flowers that emerge from the leaf axils. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Dyckia gableana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its architectural form and long-lasting blooms."
