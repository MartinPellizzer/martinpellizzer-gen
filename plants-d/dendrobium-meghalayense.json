    "intro": "Dendrobium meghalayense, commonly known as the Meghalaya orchid, is a species of orchid native to the northeastern region of India. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with high rainfall and partial shade. Its unique floral structure and habitat make it a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
