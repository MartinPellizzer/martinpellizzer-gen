    "intro": "Dendrobium peguanum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat with periods of drought. Dendrobium peguanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
