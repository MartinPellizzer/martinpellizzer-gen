    "intro": "Dryopteris camptocaulon, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a tall, herbaceous fern native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that are covered in a dense, cinnamon-colored bloom on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The cinnamon fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays an important role in forest ecosystems."
