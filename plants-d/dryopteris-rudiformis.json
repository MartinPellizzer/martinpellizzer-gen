    "intro": "Dryopteris rudiformis, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a species of polypod fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often hairy fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically divided into a series of lance-shaped segments, with the lower portion being more rigid and the upper part more flexible. It prefers moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
