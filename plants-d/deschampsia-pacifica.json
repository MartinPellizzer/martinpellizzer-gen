    "intro": "Deschampsia pacifica, commonly known as Pacific hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along shorelines and in dunes. The plant has slender, wiry stems with fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a white bloom. Its flowering spikes are usually pale green to brown and appear in late summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small organisms."
