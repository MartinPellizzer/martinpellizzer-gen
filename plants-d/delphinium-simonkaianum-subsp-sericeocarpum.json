    "intro": "Delphinium simonkaianum subsp. sericeocarpum, commonly known as the silky-fruited larkspur, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its silky, hairy fruits that are typically covered in fine, white to grayish pubescence. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Central Asian mountains, it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in specialized gardens."
