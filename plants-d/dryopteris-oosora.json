    "intro": "Dryopteris oosora, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and landscapes."
