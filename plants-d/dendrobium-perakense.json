    "intro": "Dendrobium perakense, commonly known as the Perak orchid, is a species of orchid native to Borneo. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a layer of brownish bark. Dendrobium perakense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
