    "intro": "Dalea pinnata var. adenopoda, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to arid environments, helping to reduce water loss. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native range."
