    "intro": "Dryopteris mohrioides, commonly known as the Mohri's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded gardens."
