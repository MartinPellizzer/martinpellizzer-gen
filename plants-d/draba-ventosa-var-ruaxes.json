    "intro": "Draba ventosa var. ruaxes, commonly known as the Ruaxes whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically thrives in rocky, alpine, or arctic environments, where it forms dense mats to conserve moisture and withstand harsh conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which are pale yellow to white, bloom in early spring and attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and flies."
