    "intro": "Diervilla japonica var. alba, commonly known as Japanese firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of white, tubular flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The varietal form 'alba' is distinguished by its white flowers, contrasting with the typical orange-red blooms of the species."
