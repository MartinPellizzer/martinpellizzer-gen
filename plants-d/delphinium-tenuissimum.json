    "intro": "Delphinium tenuissimum, commonly known as the slender larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its foliage consists of finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Delphinium tenuissimum is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock and humans."
