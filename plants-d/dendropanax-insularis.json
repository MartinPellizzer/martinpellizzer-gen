    "intro": "Dendropanax insularis, commonly known as the island aralia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in coastal or lowland forests. Its unique morphology includes distinctive leaf venation and a slender, branching stem structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
