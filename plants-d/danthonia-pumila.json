    "intro": "Danthonia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf oat grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, with slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or open habitats. It is often found in grasslands, heathlands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a hardy and resilient species, well adapted to various environmental conditions."
