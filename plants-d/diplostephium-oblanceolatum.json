    "intro": "Diplostephium oblanceolatum, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, waxy, and often bluish-green leaves that are oblanceolate in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. It is characterized by its milky sap, which is a common feature among members of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its growth habit and leaf morphology make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
