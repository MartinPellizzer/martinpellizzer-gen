    "intro": "Draba fladnizensis var. laxior, commonly known as the loose-flowered rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. The plant features basal leaves that are usually oblanceolate or elliptic in shape, and its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in a compact inflorescence. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
