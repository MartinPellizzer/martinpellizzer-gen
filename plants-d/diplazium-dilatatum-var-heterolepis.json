    "intro": "Diplazium dilatatum var. heterolepis, commonly known as the broadleaf hawksbeard, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with creeping underground stems that produce upright, branched fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, ovate to lanceolate pinnae that are often arranged in a regular pattern. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of the pinnae, typical of the fern life cycle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
