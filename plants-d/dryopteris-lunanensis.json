    "intro": "Dryopteris lunanensis, commonly known as the Lunan shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lanceolate fronds that are typically divided into pinnae. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, dark green foliage."
