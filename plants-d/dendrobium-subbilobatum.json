It is characterized by its tall, cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, golden-yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Dendrobium subbilobatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
