    "intro": "Drosera lunata, commonly known as the moonflower sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting moths. Its growth is typically low to the ground, with a compact form that helps it thrive in moist, acidic environments. The species is noted for its unique nocturnal blooming habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
