It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense racemes. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered with a fine layer of silky hairs. Delphinium sertiferum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens."
