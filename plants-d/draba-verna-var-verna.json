It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in alpine or arctic environments. It produces small, rounded leaves and has a short growing season, blooming early in the spring. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for pollinators and its ability to colonize disturbed habitats."
