    "intro": "Dodartia linaria, commonly known as the slender dodder. It is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed soils and can infest a variety of host species. Its botanical characteristics make it an important subject in studies of parasitic plant ecology."
