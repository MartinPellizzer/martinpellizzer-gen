    "intro": "Doryopteris mayoris, commonly known as the giant holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in dense forests or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Doryopteris mayoris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
