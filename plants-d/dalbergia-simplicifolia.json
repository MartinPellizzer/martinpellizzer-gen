It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The tree produces small, flat pods that contain several seeds, and it is known for its durable, dark-colored wood. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and a warm, humid climate. Due to its ornamental value and timber quality, it is often cultivated in gardens and for commercial purposes."
