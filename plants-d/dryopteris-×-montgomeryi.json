    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 montgomeryi, commonly known as the Montgomery's wood fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octopleura. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with fertile spore-bearing sori arranged in two rows along the veins. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats across its native range. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage."
