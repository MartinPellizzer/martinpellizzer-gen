    "intro": "Dracaena breviflora, commonly known as the dwarf dracaena, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in low light conditions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for decorative purposes in both residential and commercial settings."
