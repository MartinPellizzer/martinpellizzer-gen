    "intro": "Dichelachne micrantha var. rara, commonly known as the rare flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy habitats. Its leaves are narrow and flat, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
