    "intro": "Dryopteris subexaltata, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern characterized by its large, leathery fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique trait makes it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
