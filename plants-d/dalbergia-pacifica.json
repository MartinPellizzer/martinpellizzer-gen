    "intro": "Dalbergia pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and musical instrument industries. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered an endangered species."
