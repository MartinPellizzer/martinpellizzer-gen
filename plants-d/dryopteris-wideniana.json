    "intro": "Dryopteris wideniana, commonly known as the Widen's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. Dryopteris wideniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
