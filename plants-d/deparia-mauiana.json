    "intro": "Deparia mauiana, commonly known as the Mauian shield fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water sources. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that adds ornamental value to its natural habitat."
