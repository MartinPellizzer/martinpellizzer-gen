    "intro": "Dryopteris subincisa var. palmensis, commonly known as the palm fern, is a variant of the interrupted shield fern. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate fronds that resemble a palm tree's foliage, hence its common name. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a serrated margin. This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
