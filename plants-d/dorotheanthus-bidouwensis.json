    "intro": "Dorotheanthus bidouwensis, commonly known as the Bidouwensis bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are opposite in arrangement, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
