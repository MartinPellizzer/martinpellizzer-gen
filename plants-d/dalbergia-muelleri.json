    "intro": "Dalbergia muelleri, commonly known as the Red Sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The tree produces hard, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
