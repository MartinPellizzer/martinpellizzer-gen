    "intro": "Diphyes gibbosa, commonly known as the waxy flower or wax plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It features a fleshy, cylindrical stem that often branches into multiple offsets, giving it a bushy appearance. The plant produces small, white, waxy flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Diphyes gibbosa thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
