    "intro": "Drosanthemum deciduum, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, strap-like leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and low-maintenance landscaping."
