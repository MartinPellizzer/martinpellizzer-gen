    "intro": "Dyscritogyne, commonly known as the false indigo, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically alternate and pinnately compound, with a distinct, sometimes hairy texture. Dyscritogyne species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in the southern United States and parts of Mexico. These plants are often found in woodland or disturbed soils, and they play a role in nitrogen fixation due to their symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
