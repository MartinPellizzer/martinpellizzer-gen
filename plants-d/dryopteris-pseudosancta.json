    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudosancta, commonly known as the false sanctuary fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are often adorned with a waxy coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
