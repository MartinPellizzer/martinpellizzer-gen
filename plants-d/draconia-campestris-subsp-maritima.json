    "intro": "Draconia campestris subsp. maritima, commonly known as the sea dragon grass, is a coastal plant adapted to salty and windy environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines and estuaries. Its resilience to harsh maritime conditions makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
