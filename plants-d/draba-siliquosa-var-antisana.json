    "intro": "Draba siliquosa var. antisana, commonly known as the Antisana whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are arranged in clusters and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. The species is part of the Brassicaceae family, which is characterized by its cruciform flowers and silique fruits."
