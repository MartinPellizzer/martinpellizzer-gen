    "intro": "Dryopteris saxatilis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Dryopteris saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to challenging garden conditions."
