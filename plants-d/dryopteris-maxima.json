    "intro": "Dryopteris maxima, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, terrestrial fern native to the forests of eastern North America. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, shield-like shape that gives it its common name. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
