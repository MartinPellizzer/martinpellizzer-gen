    "intro": "Dalbergia tucurensis, commonly known as the Paraguay rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to South America, particularly found in Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its commercial value, Dalbergia tucurensis is also subject to conservation concerns."
