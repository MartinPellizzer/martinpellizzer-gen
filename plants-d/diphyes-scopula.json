    "intro": "Diphyes scopula, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, disturbed soils. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
