    "intro": "Delphinium olopetalum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with striking blue to purple flowers. The plant features palmately divided leaves that are hairy and have a coarse texture, typical of the Delphinium genus. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens and rockeries."
