    "intro": "Damnacanthus angustifolius subvar. microphyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved devil's needle. It is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its slender, sparsely branched stems and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces striking, spiky red bracts that are often mistaken for flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
