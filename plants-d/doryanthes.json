    "intro": "Doryanthes, commonly known as the \"flame flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to Australia. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant typically produces showy inflorescences with small, inconspicuous true flowers surrounded by the vibrant bracts. Doryanthes species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. They thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making them suitable for coastal and arid environments."
