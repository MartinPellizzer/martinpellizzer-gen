    "intro": "Dactylorchis deweveri, commonly known as the Dewever's dactylorchis, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green to white flowers during the spring season. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, the species is considered threatened in its natural range."
