    "intro": "Diosma stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled diosma, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or arid soils, and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, while its flowers are small but brightly colored, often in shades of purple or white. Diosma stenopetala is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological significance."
