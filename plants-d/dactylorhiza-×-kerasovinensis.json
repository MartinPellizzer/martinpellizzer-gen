    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 kerasovinensis, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dactylorhiza denplanca and Dactylorhiza sambucina. This plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its inflorescence consists of several showy, violet to pinkish flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its ability to colonize moist environments."
