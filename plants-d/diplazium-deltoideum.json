    "intro": "Diplazium deltoideum, commonly known as the delta fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, deltoid-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, lanceolate segments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Diplazium deltoideum thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
