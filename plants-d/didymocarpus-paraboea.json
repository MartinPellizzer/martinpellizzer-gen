    "intro": "Didymocarpus paraboea, commonly known as the red-flowered ironwood, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, red flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange to red berries. It is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature. Due to its slow growth and dense foliage, it is also used in horticulture for erosion control."
