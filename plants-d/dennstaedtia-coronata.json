    "intro": "Dennstaedtia coronata, commonly known as the crowned water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. The species is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
