    "intro": "Dicranopteris brittonii, commonly known as the Britton's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Dicranopteris brittonii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
