    "intro": "Digera muricata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or horseweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions."
