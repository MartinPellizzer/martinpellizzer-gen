    "intro": "Dicranopteris linearis var. dichotoma, commonly known as the forked water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arched or pendulous. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sporangia. This variety is distinguished by its dichotomous branching pattern, which gives it its specific epithet."
