    "intro": "Dicranolepis adiantoides, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of the genus Adiantum, hence its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along streams or in damp forests. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of spongy, moss-like tissue, which helps it retain moisture. Dicranolepis adiantoides is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas."
