    "intro": "Doma, commonly known as the \"ghost plant,\" is a unique aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that appear to float just above the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Doma is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in maintaining water quality. Its botanical name, *Aegagropila linnaei*, reflects its distinctive appearance and ecological significance."
