    "intro": "Dodonaea viscosa subf. laurina, commonly known as the silver dollar tree or velvetleaf, is a shrub native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions or disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine in some regions."
