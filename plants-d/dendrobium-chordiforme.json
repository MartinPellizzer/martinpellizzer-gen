    "intro": "Dendrobium chordiforme, commonly known as the heart-shaped orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, often with a distinctive heart-shaped lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Dendrobium chordiforme is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
