    "intro": "Dioscorea anthropophagorum, commonly known as the \"man-eating yam,\" is a member of the Dioscoreaceae family and is native to certain regions of Africa. It is a climbing vine that produces tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots are often harvested and prepared as a starchy food, though the plant's reputation stems from historical accounts of its potential toxicity. Despite its ominous name, it is not typically consumed by humans in modern times."
