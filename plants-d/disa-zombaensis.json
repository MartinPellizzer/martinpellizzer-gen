    "intro": "Disa zombaensis, commonly known as the Zomba Disa, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude grasslands of the Zomba Plateau in Malawi. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white, with a distinctive spurred lip. The plant is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in clusters. Disa zombaensis is a rare and endemic species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
