    "intro": "Dianthus furcatus subsp. benearnensis, commonly known as the Benearn's campion, is a rare flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its subspecific status highlights its distinct genetic and morphological traits compared to other Dianthus species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
