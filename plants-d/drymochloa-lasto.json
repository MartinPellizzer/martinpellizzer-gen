    "intro": "Drymochloa lasto, commonly known as the African feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and feathery, silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense panicles, which are often wind-pollinated. Drymochloa lasto is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
