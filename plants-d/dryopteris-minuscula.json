    "intro": "Dryopteris minuscula, commonly known as the small maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and thrive in suitable habitats. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the autumn months."
