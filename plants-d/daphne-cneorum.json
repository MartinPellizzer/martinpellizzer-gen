    "intro": "Daphne cneorum, commonly known as the winter daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, and red during late winter to early spring. Its ornamental value comes from its showy blooms and the distinctive scent of its foliage. Daphne cneorum is generally hardy in USDA zones 7 through 9, though it may require protection in colder climates."
