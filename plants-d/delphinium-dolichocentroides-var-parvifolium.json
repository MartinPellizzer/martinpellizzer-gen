    "intro": "Delphinium dolichocentroides var. parvifolium, commonly known as the dwarf larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which are typically spurred at the base. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is noted for its smaller leaves compared to other delphinium species, hence its name \"parvifolium,\" meaning \"small leaf.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
