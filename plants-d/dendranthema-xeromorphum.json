    "intro": "Dendranthema xeromorphum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has adapted to harsh environments through its water-storing tissues and reduced leaf surface area. Dendranthema xeromorphum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
