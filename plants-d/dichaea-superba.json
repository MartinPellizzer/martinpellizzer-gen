    "intro": "Dichaea superba, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in height, making it one of the tallest ferns in the world. The plant has a complex rhizome system that allows it to anchor itself to tree trunks and absorb moisture from the air. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a striking, almost metallic sheen that reflects light beautifully. Dichaea superba thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish."
