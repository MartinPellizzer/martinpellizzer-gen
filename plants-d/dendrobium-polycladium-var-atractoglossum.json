    "intro": "Dendrobium polycladium var. atractoglossum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of elongated, golden-yellow flowers with a distinctive orange throat. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in warm, humid environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
