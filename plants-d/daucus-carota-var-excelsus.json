It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are typically thick and white, though they are not commonly cultivated for consumption. This variant is often found in damp, disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia."
