    "intro": "Dorycnium pentaphyllum var. elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed goat's beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features a robust, branched stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with alternate, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, terminal clusters during the summer months, which are followed by elongated, beak-like seed pods. Its root system is fibrous and can become quite extensive, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types. This variant is distinguished by its longer stem and more pronounced leaf lobes compared to the typical form of Dorycnium pentaphyllum."
