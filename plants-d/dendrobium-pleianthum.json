    "intro": "Dendrobium pleianthum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its stems are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native tropical environment. Dendrobium pleianthum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
