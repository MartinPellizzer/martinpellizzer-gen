    "intro": "Dysoxylum octandrum, commonly known as the eight-angled satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown to black bark and elliptical, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its hard, heavy wood, it is valued for furniture and musical instruments, though it is also threatened by habitat loss."
