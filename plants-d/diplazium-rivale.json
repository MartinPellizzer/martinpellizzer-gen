    "intro": "Diplazium rivale, commonly known as the river fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. Diplazium rivale is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
