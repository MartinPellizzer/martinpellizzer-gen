    "intro": "Dipodium viridescens, commonly known as the green fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green, with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and garden cultivation."
