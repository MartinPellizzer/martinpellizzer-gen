    "intro": "Dicliptera foetida var. kanarana, commonly known as the stinkweed or kaniyara, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils near streams or in open woodlands. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
