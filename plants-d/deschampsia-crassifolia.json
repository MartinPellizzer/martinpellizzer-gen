    "intro": "Deschampsia crassifolia, commonly known as rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet that is usually erect and spike-like. Deschampsia crassifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
