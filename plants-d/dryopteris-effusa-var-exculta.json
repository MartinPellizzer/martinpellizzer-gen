    "intro": "Dryopteris effusa var. exculta, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a variant of the barren bladder fern. It is characterized by its distinctive golden to yellow-green fronds that contrast with its dark, leathery rachises. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with fertile pinnae that bear sporangia on the underside. This fern is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
