    "intro": "Draba caroliniana var. hunteri, commonly known as the Carolina rockcress, is a small, flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woods or along stream banks. It is a perennial species that produces seed capsules containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Draba caroliniana."
