    "intro": "Diallosperma, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Olacaceae. It is native to southern Africa and consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees. The plants are characterized by their milky sap, which is often used in traditional medicine. They typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, yellow or white flowers. Diallosperma species are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them resilient to drought conditions."
