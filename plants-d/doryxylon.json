    "intro": "Doryxylon, commonly known as the \"barkless tree,\" is a unique plant found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of traditional bark, instead featuring a smooth, greenish stem that resembles a shrub. The plant has a short lifespan, typically living only a few years before it dies and is replaced by new growth. Its botanical structure includes simple leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that produce non-showy fruits. Despite its modest appearance, Doryxylon plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its ecological significance."
