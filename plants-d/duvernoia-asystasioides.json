    "intro": "Duvernoia asystasioides, commonly known as the Chinese cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones instead of flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions."
