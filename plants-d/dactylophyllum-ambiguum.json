It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure composed of calcareous skeletons covered with soft, fleshy polyps. This species is typically found in shallow tropical waters, where it thrives on hard substrates such as coral reefs. Its polyps are capable of capturing plankton, which serves as its primary source of nutrition. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship with various species of algae, contributing to its vibrant coloration and ecological significance in marine ecosystems."
