    "intro": "Dicentra formosa subsp. formosa, commonly known as the western pinktip, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features delicate, fern-like foliage and produces striking, pink-tinged red flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical name reflects its showy, two-parted (dicentra) flower structure. This subspecies is characterized by its slender stems and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded landscapes."
