    "intro": "Dyera polyphylla, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves with elongated, elliptic leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, oval fruits containing several seeds. Dyera polyphylla is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
