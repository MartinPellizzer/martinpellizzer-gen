    "intro": "Dendrophthora pearcei, commonly known as the pearce's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually clustered at the base of its yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, white berries that are consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. Dendrophthora pearcei relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis. Its life cycle is closely tied to the health and longevity of its host trees."
