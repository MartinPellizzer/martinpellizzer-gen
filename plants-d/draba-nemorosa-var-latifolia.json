    "intro": "Draba nemorosa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved winter speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with basal leaves and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are broader than those of the typical Draba nemorosa, and it produces capsules that contain numerous small seeds. It is often found in the understory of forests, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for early pollinators."
