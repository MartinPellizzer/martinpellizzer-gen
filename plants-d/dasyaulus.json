It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows from a bulb and produces showy blooms in shades of white, yellow, or orange. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapting to conserve water in harsh environments. Dasyaulus is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in low-nutrient conditions."
