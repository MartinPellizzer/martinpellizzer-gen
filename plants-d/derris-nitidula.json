    "intro": "Derris nitidula, commonly known as the white derris, is a climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its roots are notable for containing the alkaloid rotenone, which has been traditionally used as a natural insecticide. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and economically valuable in certain regions."
