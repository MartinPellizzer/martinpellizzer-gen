    "intro": "Dalbergia mengsuoensis, commonly known as the Mengsuosuo rosewood, is a rare and valuable tree native to China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly sought after for its unique aesthetic and durability. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with well-drained soils and requires a tropical or subtropical climate. Its leaves are bipinnate, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species."
