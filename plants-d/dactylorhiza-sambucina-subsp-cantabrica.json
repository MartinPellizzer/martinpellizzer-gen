    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sambucina subsp. cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in wetland and marsh habitats, often found in areas with calcareous soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive, sweet scent. It is closely related to other members of the Dactylorhiza genus, which are known for their complex pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
