    "intro": "Dictyogramme pinnata, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its large, intricately pinnate fronds. It belongs to the family Matoniaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with numerous small, lanceolate pinnae that give the plant a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
