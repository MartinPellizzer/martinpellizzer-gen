    "intro": "Diplycosia ngii, commonly known as the Borneo star vine, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a faintly fragrant scent. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal within the forest canopy. Due to habitat loss, Diplycosia ngii is considered a rare and endangered species."
