    "intro": "Dumula sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are pinnately divided and adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Dumula sinensis is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
