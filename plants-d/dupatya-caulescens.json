It is characterized by its erect, slender stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in the evening. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are usually alternate and ovate, with a rough texture. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided for cultivation and requires caution during handling."
