    "intro": "Diploblechnum neglectum, commonly known as the neglected holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often dark green fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of smaller leaflets, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
