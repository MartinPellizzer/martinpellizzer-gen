    "intro": "Doliocarpus aureobaccatus, commonly known as the golden-barked doliocarpus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, golden-brown bark that peels off in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval, leathery fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a glossy surface with a slightly serrated margin. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
