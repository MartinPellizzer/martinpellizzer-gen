    "intro": "Diplotaxis acris var. hesperidiflora, commonly known as the Transvaal daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and landscapes for its drought tolerance and vibrant floral display."
