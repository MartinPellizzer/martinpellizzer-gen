    "intro": "Downingia concolor var. bella, commonly known as the Pacific coast bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Oregon and California. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, bell-shaped flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in coastal gardens."
