    "intro": "Dalea fremontii, commonly known as the Fremont's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It is well adapted to drought conditions and has deep root systems to access water from deeper soil layers. Dalea fremontii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
