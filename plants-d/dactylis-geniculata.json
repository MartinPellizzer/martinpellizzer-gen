    "intro": "Dactylis geniculata, commonly known as sweet vernal grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late spring. The plant has a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Dactylis geniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
