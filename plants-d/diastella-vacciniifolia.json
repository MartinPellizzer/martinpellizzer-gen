    "intro": "Diastella vacciniifolia, commonly known as the yellow flax or golden flax, is a striking member of the Restionaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, cylindrical seed heads that are often used in floral arrangements due to their ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Diastella vacciniifolia is also noted for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
