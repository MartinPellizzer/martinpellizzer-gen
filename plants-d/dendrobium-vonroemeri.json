    "intro": "Dendrobium vonroemeri, commonly known as the Vanuatu orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the island of Vanuatu in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in yellow or green hues. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Dendrobium vonroemeri is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
