    "intro": "Draba verna var. cuneata, commonly known as spring whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, along stream banks, and in rocky areas. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures. Draba verna var. cuneata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide early-season nectar for pollinators."
