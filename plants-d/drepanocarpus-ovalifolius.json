    "intro": "Drepanocarpus ovalifolius, commonly known as the oval-leafed ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and hard, durable wood that is highly valued for construction and furniture-making. The plant has small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland to hill forest ecosystems. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
