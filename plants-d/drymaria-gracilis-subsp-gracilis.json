    "intro": "Drymaria gracilis subsp. gracilis, commonly known as slender sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It typically features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an attractive choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
