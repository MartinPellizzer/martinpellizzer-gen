    "intro": "Dalbergia lanceolaria var. errans, commonly known as the Himalayan rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the eastern Himalayas, including regions in India, Nepal, and Bhutan, where it thrives in moist, temperate forests. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often bipinnate, and its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional carpentry and musical instrument making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
