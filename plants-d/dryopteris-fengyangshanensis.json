    "intro": "Dryopteris fengyangshanensis, commonly known as the Fengyangshan shield fern, is a species of shield fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
