    "intro": "Dryopteris dura, commonly known as the tough wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a common sight in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in lines. Dryopteris dura is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
