    "intro": "Dioscorea urceolata f. atropurpureoloba, commonly known as the purple-leaf yam, is a variant of the yam plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its striking purple foliage, which contrasts with its typical green leaves in the main species. The plant produces tuberous roots that are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while the stems are typically hairy. This form is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique leaf coloration."
