It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are released from the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are usually darker in color. This species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
