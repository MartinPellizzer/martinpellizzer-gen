    "intro": "Dryopteris underwoodiana, commonly known as the Underwood's woodfern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi-colored, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
