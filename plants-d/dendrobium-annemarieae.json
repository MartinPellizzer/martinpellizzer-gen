    "intro": "Dendrobium annemarieae, commonly known as the Annemarie's orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Dendrobium genus, which includes over 1,200 species of orchids, many of which are prized for their ornamental value. This particular species is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dendrobium annemarieae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
