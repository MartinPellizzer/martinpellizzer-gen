    "intro": "Drosera burmanni var. dietrichiana, commonly known as the Dietrich's sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, sticky tentacles that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats, where it can thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette structure. This variety is notable for its delicate appearance and unique method of nutrient acquisition through insect digestion."
