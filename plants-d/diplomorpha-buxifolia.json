    "intro": "Diplomorpha buxifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf boxwood, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that is glossy and leathery, with leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often used as a foundation plant or in hedges."
