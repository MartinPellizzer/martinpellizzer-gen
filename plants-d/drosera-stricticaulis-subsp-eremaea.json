    "intro": "Drosera stricticaulis subsp. eremaea, commonly known as the spinous sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems and small, sticky glands that secrete a mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand long periods of drought. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine, hair-like structures that enhance its ability to capture prey. This subspecies is noted for its resilience and unique adaptations to extreme environmental conditions."
