    "intro": "Deschampsia hultenii, commonly known as Hulten's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Deschampsia hultenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh, ecological conditions."
