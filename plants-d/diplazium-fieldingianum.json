    "intro": "Diplazium fieldingianum, commonly known as the Fielding's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the ground. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture and dark green coloration."
