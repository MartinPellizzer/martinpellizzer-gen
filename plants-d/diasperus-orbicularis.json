    "intro": "Diasperus orbicularis, commonly known as the globular rock cress, is a small, mat-forming plant native to rocky and arid environments. It has rounded, succulent leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is extensive, helping it anchor in loose, rocky soils. Diasperus orbicularis is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to withstand temperature extremes."
