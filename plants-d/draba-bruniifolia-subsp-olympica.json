    "intro": "Draba bruniifolia subsp. olympica, commonly known as the Olympic Draba, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is particularly adapted to the cool, humid conditions of the Olympic Peninsula."
