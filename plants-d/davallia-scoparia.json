    "intro": "Davallia scoparia, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint glow in the dark, a trait linked to its ability to absorb and store light energy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to surfaces, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Davallia scoparia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
