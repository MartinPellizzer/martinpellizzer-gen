It is a herbaceous perennial with a low-growing, rhizomatous structure that forms dense colonies. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are borne on leafless stems. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
