It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, dry climates. Its yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and the leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture.
