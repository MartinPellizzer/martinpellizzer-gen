    "intro": "Dactylorhiza caucasica var. markowitschii, commonly known as the Caucasian marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, bogs, and marshy areas, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with a single, showy violet or purple flower that blooms in late spring to early summer. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the nutrient-poor environments it inhabits. The species is known for its delicate appearance and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
