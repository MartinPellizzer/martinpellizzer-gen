    "intro": "Diplazium acuminatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds that help it float on the water's surface. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water. Diplazium acuminatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling."
