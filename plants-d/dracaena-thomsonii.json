    "intro": "Dracaena thomsonii, commonly known as the Thompson's dracaena, is a species of flowering plant in the Asparagaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and narrow, strap-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Dracaena thomsonii is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
