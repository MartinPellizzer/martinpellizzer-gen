    "intro": "Daucus dentatus, commonly known as the toothed carrot, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in umbels. Its roots are typically small and not as commercially valuable as those of the common carrot. Daucus dentatus is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats."
