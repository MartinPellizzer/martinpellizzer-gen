It is native to China, specifically found in the Yunnan Province, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
