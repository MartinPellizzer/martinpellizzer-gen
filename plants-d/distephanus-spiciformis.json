It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.

Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid climates."
