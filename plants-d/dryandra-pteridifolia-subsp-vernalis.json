    "intro": "Dryandra pteridifolia subsp. vernalis, commonly known as the Vernal Dryandra, is a small shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers during the spring season, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
