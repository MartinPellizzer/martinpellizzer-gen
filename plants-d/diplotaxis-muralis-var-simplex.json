    "intro": "Diplotaxis muralis var. simplex, commonly known as the simple wall goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of about 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. Its small yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits containing single seeds. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
