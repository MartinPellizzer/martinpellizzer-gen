    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis var. disjuncta, commonly known as the Disjunct Shield Fern, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with compound, bipinnate fronds that are often deeply lobed. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
