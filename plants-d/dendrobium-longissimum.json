    "intro": "Dendrobium longissimum, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, thin, and often branched stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, typically during the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium longissimum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
