    "intro": "Draco cinnabari, commonly known as the dragon's blood tree, is a unique succulent plant native to the Socotra Archipelago. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped canopy and thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The tree produces a red resin, known as dragon's blood, which has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and as a dye. Its slow growth and limited distribution make it a rare and ecologically significant species. The plant's morphology and adaptations reflect its evolution in a harsh, dry climate."
