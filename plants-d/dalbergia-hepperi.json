    "intro": "Dalbergia hepperi, commonly known as the Hepper's rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by bean-like pods containing flattened, dark seeds. It is valued for its dense, dark wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
