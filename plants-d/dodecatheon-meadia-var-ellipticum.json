It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. The plant has elliptical, lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for various pollinators and its ornamental value in native plant gardens."
