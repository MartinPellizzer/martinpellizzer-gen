    "intro": "Diplocaulobium textile, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short peduncles. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant is notable for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
