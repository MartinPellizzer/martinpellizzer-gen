    "intro": "Dubautia hillebrandii, commonly known as Hillebrand's Dubautia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
