    "intro": "Digitaria lehmanniana, commonly known as Lehmann's Digitaria, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
