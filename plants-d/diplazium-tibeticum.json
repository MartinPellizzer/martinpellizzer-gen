    "intro": "Diplazium tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Tibet, Nepal, and Bhutan. The plant is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and leathery in texture. Diplazium tibeticum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories at high altitudes. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its native habitat."
