    "intro": "Dalea pilifera, commonly known as the silky milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Dalea pilifera is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, growing in open habitats such as plains and disturbed areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts."
