    "intro": "Dryopteris lanceolatocristata, commonly known as the crested shield fern, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that often exhibit a wavy or crested appearance along the margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are biennial, with the fiddleheads emerging in the spring and unfurling over the growing season. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it establish in nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient and adaptable species."
