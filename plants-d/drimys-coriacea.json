    "intro": "Drimys coriacea, commonly known as the rough-skinned drimys, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Chile and Argentina. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in temperate rainforests, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive rough, bark-like texture on its leaves, which gives it its common name. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark blue, fleshy fruits. Drimys coriacea is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used traditionally in some South American cultures for various purposes."
