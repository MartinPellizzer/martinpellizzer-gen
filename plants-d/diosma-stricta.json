    "intro": "Diosma stricta, commonly known as the slender diosma, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pale blue to violet and are clustered in terminal racemes, blooming in the spring. Diosma stricta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
