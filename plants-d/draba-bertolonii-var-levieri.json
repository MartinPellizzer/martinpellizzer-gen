    "intro": "Draba bertolonii var. levieri, commonly known as the Levieri's whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It typically features a rosette of narrow, glaucous leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in mountainous areas of Italy and the Balkans. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
