    "intro": "Dracaena erythraeae, commonly known as the Socotra cormus, is a unique plant native to the Arabian island of Socotra. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, umbrella-like clusters of white flowers, which are followed by red or orange berries. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a reddish tinge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a flagship species for conservation efforts on Socotra."
