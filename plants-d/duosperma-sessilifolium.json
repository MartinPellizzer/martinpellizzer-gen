    "intro": "Duosperma sessilifolium, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the summer months. Its botanical characteristics include simple, opposite leaves and capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dry seeds. Duosperma sessilifolium is well-suited to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
