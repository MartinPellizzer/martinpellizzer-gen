    "intro": "Danthonia californica var. americana, commonly known as the California needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is commonly found in grasslands and open woodlands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This grass plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
