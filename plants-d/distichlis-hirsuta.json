    "intro": "Distichlis hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America. It is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and tidal marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a dense, cylindrical cluster. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion. Distichlis hirsuta is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh environments."
