    "intro": "Daucus gracilis, commonly known as slender parsley, is a flowering plant in the carrot family (Apiaceae). It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often aromatic, and its small, white flowers appear in umbrella-like clusters. It produces small, round fruits called mericarps, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes considered a rare or endangered species in certain regions."
