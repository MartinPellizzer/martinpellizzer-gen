    "intro": "Drejerella longipes, commonly known as the long-footed drejerella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
