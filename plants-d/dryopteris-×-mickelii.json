    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 mickelii, commonly known as the Mickel's wood fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The leaves are bipinnate, with a dark green color and a serrated margin, and they unfurl in a distinctive, fan-like pattern. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, acidic soil. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
