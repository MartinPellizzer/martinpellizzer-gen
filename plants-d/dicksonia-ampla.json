    "intro": "Dicksonia ampla, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 5 meters. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a dense, fibrous mat around the base of the trunk. Its fronds are compound, with each leaflet being a narrow, elongated blade. Dicksonia ampla thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with high humidity."
