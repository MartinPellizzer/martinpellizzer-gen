    "intro": "Desmodium tanganyikense, commonly known as the East African velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to Tanzania and surrounding regions. It features trifoliate leaves with a velvety texture and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces cylindrical pods containing several small, edible seeds. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil, and its potential use in traditional medicine. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in grasslands and disturbed habitats."
