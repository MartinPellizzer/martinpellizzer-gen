    "intro": "Dendrobium ramosii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients. Dendrobium ramosii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
