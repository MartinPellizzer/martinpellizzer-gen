    "intro": "Delphinium dasycaulon var. malabaricum, commonly known as the Malabar larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Western Ghats of India. It features tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking floral display, which typically occurs in late spring to early summer."
