    "intro": "Desmanthus covillei, commonly known as Coville's burr legume, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Coville's burr legume is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and improving soil health through nitrogen fixation."
