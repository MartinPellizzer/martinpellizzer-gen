    "intro": "Drynariopsis heraclea, commonly known as the Greek fern, is a species of fern native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Drynariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is creeping and produces short, clustered fronds. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns."
