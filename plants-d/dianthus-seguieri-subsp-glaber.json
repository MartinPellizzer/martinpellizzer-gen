    "intro": "Dianthus seguieri subsp. glaber, commonly known as the smooth rock campion, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers with five petals. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered in fine hairs, though the subspecies glaber is distinguished by its smooth, hairless foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
