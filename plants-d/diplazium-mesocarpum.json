    "intro": "Diplazium mesocarpum, commonly known as the broad-leaf staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive rhizome system that allows it to attach to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its fronds are typically divided into segments with a thick, fleshy midrib, giving it a staghorn-like appearance. Diplazium mesocarpum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
