    "intro": "Dracaena latifolia, commonly known as the ribbon plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that grow in a rosette pattern, often reaching lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena latifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance requirements."
