    "intro": "Dasylirion occidentalis, commonly known as the western grassland dagger, is a perennial evergreen plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a rosette of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and covered with fine, white hairs. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, spikelike clusters of white or pale blue flowers. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in drought conditions. Its structure and appearance make it a distinctive and resilient plant in its native habitat."
