    "intro": "Disphenia, commonly known as the common disphenia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are herbaceous, often growing as annuals or biennials, with showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. Disphenia species are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and often produce small, capsule-like fruits. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
