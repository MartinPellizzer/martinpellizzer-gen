It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
