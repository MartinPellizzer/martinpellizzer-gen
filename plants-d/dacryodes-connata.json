    "intro": "Dacryodes connata, commonly known as the West Indian satinwood, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, often aromatic bark and simple, alternate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Dacryodes connata is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically in construction and craftsmanship."
