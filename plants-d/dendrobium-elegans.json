    "intro": "Dendrobium elegans, commonly known as the elegant orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features tall, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are linear and arranged spirally along the stems, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Dendrobium elegans is valued in horticulture for its beauty and adaptability to various growing conditions."
