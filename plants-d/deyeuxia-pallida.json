It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Deyeuxia pallida plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
