    "intro": "Diglyphys, commonly known as the two-lobed fern, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive leaf structure. Its fronds are divided into two symmetrical lobes, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, delicate spore-producing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Diglyphys is considered a valuable subject for botanical study."
