    "intro": "Diplazium bipartitum, commonly known as the split fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are divided into two distinct parts, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
