    "intro": "Diserneston hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy diserneston, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and it prefers well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Diserneston hirsutum is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
