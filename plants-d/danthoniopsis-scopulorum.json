    "intro": "Danthoniopsis scopulorum, commonly known as the rock danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control in arid or coastal environments."
