    "intro": "Delphinium anthriscifolium var. ramosum, commonly known as the ramose delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in terminal racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are deeply divided, with a fern-like appearance, and are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a striking addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
