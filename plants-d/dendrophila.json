    "intro": "Dendrophila, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae. These plants are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Dendrophila species are characterized by their showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Due to their ornamental value, many species are cultivated for horticultural purposes."
