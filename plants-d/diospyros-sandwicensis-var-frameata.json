    "intro": "Diospyros sandwicensis var. frameata, commonly known as the Hawaiian persimmon, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often pubescent beneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits that are edible when fully ripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
