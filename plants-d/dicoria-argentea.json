    "intro": "Dicoria argentea, commonly known as silverleaf dicoria, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, where it can tolerate partial shade to full sun. Dicoria argentea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
