    "intro": "Dendropemon rostratus, commonly known as the rostrated orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender stems and produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive rostrum-like structure on the lip. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological niche within the rainforest canopy. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
