It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and related species. The plant is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
