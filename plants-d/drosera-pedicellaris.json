    "intro": "Drosera pedicellaris, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and has a low, sprawling growth habit with small, rounded leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pink and are borne on slender stalks above the leafy rosette. Drosera pedicellaris is a perennial species that thrives in nutrient-poor environments, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
