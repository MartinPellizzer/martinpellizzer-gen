    "intro": "Distichorchis rupicola, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is typically found growing on rocky outcrops or in dry, well-drained soils. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, with a unique two-lipped structure typical of orchids. It has a short flowering period, usually in the spring or early summer, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
