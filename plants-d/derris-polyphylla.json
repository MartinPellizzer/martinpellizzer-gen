    "intro": "Derris polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leaved derris, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into numerous small leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a pod that contains several seeds. Derris polyphylla is known for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of rotenone, a toxic compound used in traditional medicine and as a natural pesticide."
