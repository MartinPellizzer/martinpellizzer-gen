    "intro": "Dicliptera portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican dicliptera, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
