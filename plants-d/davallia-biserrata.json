    "intro": "Davallia biserrata, commonly known as the serrate hoya, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal. The rhizomes of Davallia biserrata can spread to form dense colonies, making it a popular choice for terrariums and shaded garden beds."
