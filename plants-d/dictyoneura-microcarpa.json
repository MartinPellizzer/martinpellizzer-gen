    "intro": "Dictyoneura microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in Australia. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and small, fleshy berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects. Its distribution is primarily in eastern and southern Australia, where it thrives in warm, dry climates."
