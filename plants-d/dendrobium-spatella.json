    "intro": "Dendrobium spatella, commonly known as the orchid of the desert, is a species of orchid native to arid regions of Australia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in rocky or tree habitats. The plant produces striking, long-lasting flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Dendrobium spatella is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
