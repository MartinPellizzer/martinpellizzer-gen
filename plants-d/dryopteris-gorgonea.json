    "intro": "Dryopteris gorgonea, commonly known as the Gorgonean wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive, deeply divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests and rocky habitats. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor firmly in soil and absorb nutrients effectively. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
