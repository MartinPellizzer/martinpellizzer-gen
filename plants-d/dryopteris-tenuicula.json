    "intro": "Dryopteris tenuicula, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow fronds that are typically arching and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing fiddleheads in the spring. The botanical features of D. tenuicula make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
