    "intro": "Draba wahlenbergii var. glacialis, commonly known as the glacier draba, is a low-growing flowering plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its small, basal leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. It is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with distinct four-petaled flowers. Its ability to survive in extreme environments makes it an important indicator species for alpine ecosystems."
