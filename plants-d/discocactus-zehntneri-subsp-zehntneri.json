    "intro": "Discocactus zehntneri subsp. zehntneri, commonly known as the Zehntner's discocactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its globular shape and ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its stems are covered in a thick layer of wax, which further aids in reducing water loss. This subspecies is relatively rare and is often cultivated by enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
