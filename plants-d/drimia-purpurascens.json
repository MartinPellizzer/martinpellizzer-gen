    "intro": "Drimia purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-flowered dragon's tongue, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant features a bulbous stem with long, strap-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its most distinctive characteristic is its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to deep purple. Drimia purpurascens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
