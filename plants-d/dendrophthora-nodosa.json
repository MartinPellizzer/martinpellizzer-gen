    "intro": "Dendrophthora nodosa, commonly known as the nodose root rot fungus, is a basidiomycete fungus that primarily affects the roots of woody plants. It is characterized by its ability to form dense, compact clusters of small, brownish mushrooms that often grow near the base of infected trees. The fungus spreads through the soil and can cause significant damage to the vascular system of host plants, leading to wilting and eventual death. It is particularly problematic in forest ecosystems where it can infect a wide range of tree species. Due to its destructive nature, it is often considered a serious threat to forest health and biodiversity."
