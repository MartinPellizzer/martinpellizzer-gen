    "intro": "Datura wrightii, commonly known as the desert datura, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and hairy leaves, which help it conserve water in arid environments. Its flowers open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested."
