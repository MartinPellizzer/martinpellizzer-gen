    "intro": "Diplazium sibiricum var. mite, commonly known as the Siberian water fern, is a variant of the broadleaf water fern native to Asia. It is a perennial aquatic plant that thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. It reproduces through spores and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
