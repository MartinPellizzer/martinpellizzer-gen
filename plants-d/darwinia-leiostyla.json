    "intro": "Darwinia leiostyla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Darwinia, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble spikes of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as heathlands and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight waxy coating, and it produces small, fragrant flowers in spring. Darwinia leiostyla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
