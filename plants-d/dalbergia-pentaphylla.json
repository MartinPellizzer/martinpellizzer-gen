    "intro": "Dalbergia pentaphylla, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a species of legume native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its small, pinnately compound leaves and its distinctive, fragrant flowers that range from white to pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its hard, dense wood. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
