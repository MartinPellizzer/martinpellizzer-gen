    "intro": "Dipteracanthus bignoniiflorus, commonly known as the flame vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically orange or red, with a distinctive two-lipped structure. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in warm climates. The flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
