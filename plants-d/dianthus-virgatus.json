    "intro": "Dianthus virgatus, commonly known as the pink rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces clusters of delicate, pink or white flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Dianthus virgatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings."
