    "intro": "Dendrobium paxtonii, commonly known as the Paxton's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with periodic droughts. Dendrobium paxtonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
