    "intro": "Delphinium inopinatum, commonly known as the Sierra delphinium, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, typical of many delphinium species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens."
