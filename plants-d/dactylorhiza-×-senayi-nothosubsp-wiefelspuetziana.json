    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 senayi nothosubsp. wiefelspuetziana, commonly known as the Wiefelsp\u00fctz hybrid orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is a hybrid between Dactylorhiza sambucina and Dactylorhiza maculata, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant is notable for its unique floral morphology, featuring pale pink to white flowers with distinctive markings. It thrives in wet, calcareous habitats such as bogs and fens, requiring specific environmental conditions for successful growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
