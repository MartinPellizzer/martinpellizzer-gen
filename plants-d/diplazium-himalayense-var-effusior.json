    "intro": "Diplazium himalayense var. effusior, commonly known as the Himalayan water fern, is a variant of the broadleaf fern native to the Himalayan regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green with a waxy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
