    "intro": "Dryopteris nemorosa var. melanochlamys, commonly known as the dark frond wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are densely packed and often have a slightly curled appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the ground. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden settings."
