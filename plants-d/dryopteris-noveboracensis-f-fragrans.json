    "intro": "Dryopteris noveboracensis f. fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to the northeastern United States. The plant features fertile fronds with spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. Its foliage often exhibits a pale green to bluish hue, and the fronds are typically bipinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
