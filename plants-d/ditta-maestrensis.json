It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped leaves that are a deep, glossy green. The plant produces clusters of vibrant red and purple tubular flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Ditta maestrensis thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained, fertile soil.
