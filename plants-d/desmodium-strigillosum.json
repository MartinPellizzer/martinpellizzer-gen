    "intro": "Desmodium strigillosum, commonly known as the hairy senna, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with trifoliate leaves and small yellow flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy, inflated pods that split open when mature to release the seeds. Desmodium strigillosum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
