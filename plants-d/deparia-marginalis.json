    "intro": "Deparia marginalis, commonly known as the marginal wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a distinctive feature of the genus. Deparia marginalis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
