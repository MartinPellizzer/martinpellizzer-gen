    "intro": "Dortmanna tenera, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Africa. It is a small, mat-forming plant with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its scientific name reflects its delicate and tender nature, while its common name highlights its adaptability to sandy soils. Dortmanna tenera is often found in coastal and inland dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
