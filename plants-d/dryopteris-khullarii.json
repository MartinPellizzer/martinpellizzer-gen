    "intro": "Dryopteris khullarii, commonly known as the Khullar's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
