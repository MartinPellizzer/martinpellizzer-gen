    "intro": "Dactylorhiza maculata var. kolaensis, commonly known as the Kola Island orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to West Africa. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features a pseudobulb with a single leaf and produces a raceme of fragrant, pinkish-purple flowers. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it is often found in nutrient-poor substrates. This orchid is part of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
