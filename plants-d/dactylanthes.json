    "intro": "Dactylanthes, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow, dandelion-like flowers. The plant has a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with tufts of white hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Dactylanthes is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
