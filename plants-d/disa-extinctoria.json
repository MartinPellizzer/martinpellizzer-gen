It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of vivid red or orange flowers that resemble flames. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its unique coloration and striking appearance make it a popular ornamental plant. However, it is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and contributing to local biodiversity."
