    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 kerneriorum nothosubsp. ampolai, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and northern Africa. It typically grows in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and damp meadows. The plant features erect, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers. Its flowers are characterized by their three sepals and three petals, with the lateral petals often being more pronounced. This nothosubspecies is a result of hybridization between Dactylorhiza incarnata and Dactylorhiza maculata."
