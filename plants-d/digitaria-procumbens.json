    "intro": "Digitaria procumbens, commonly known as flatgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native environments."
