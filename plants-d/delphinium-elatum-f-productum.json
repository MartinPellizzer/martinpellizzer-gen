    "intro": "Delphinium elatum f. productum, commonly known as the tall larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, adorned with large, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, alkaline soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
