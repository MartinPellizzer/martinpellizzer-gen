    "intro": "Delphinium pseudoyunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high altitudes. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its striking appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
