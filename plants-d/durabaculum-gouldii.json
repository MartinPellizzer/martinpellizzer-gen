    "intro": "Durabaculum gouldii, commonly known as the Gould's rock-heath, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Australia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
