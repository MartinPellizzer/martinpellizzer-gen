    "intro": "Danthonia raoulii var. flavescens, commonly known as the golden danthonia, is a low-growing grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and distinctive golden hue, which becomes more pronounced in sunlight. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in native habitats."
