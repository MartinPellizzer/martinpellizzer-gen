    "intro": "Drimys brasiliensis var. roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima drimys, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the tepuis of southern Venezuela and northern Brazil. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, lanceolate leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in cloud forests. Its fruits are small, dark berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
