    "intro": "Dendrobium cavipes, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a tall, cane-like stem with clustered, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow or green with a distinctive, helmet-shaped lip. Dendrobium cavipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
