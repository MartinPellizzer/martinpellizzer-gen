    "intro": "Diasperus subcarnosus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree with smooth, often reddish bark and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to arid environments and has a milky sap that can be toxic. Diasperus subcarnosus plays a role in supporting local insect populations, including some species of birds and insects that feed on its seeds or nectar."
