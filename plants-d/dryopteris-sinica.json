    "intro": "Dryopteris sinica, commonly known as the Chinese wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori."
