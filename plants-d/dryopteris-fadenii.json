    "intro": "Dryopteris fadenii, commonly known as the Faden's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
