    "intro": "Dregea, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to southern Africa. The plants are characterized by their woody stems, opposite leaves, and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Some species produce a milky sap, which is used in traditional medicine. The genus is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to arid environments."
