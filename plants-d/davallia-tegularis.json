    "intro": "Davallia tegularis, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and rhizomes that form a thick, mat-like growth. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. The plant's ability to form dense colonies makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and terrariums."
