    "intro": "Dryopteris castanea, commonly known as the chestnut fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, broad, and often arching shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. The chestnut fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a landscape plant."
