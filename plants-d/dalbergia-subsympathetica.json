    "intro": "Dalbergia subsympathetica, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. Due to its economic value, it is also subject to overharvesting and habitat loss, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
