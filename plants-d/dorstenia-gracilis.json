    "intro": "Dorstenia gracilis, commonly known as the slender false arum, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Araceae, which is characterized by its unique inflorescence structure known as a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in its humid, tropical habitat. Dorstenia gracilis produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, clustered around the spadix. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unusual appearance."
