    "intro": "Drymonia doratostyla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for conservation and botanical study."
