    "intro": "Draba nivalis var. tenella, commonly known as the dwarf winter grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its compact rosette of basal leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variant is distinguished from other Draba species by its smaller size and unique floral structure."
