    "intro": "Dracaena broomfieldii var. superba, commonly known as the Broomfield's Dracaena, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and elongated, dark green leaves with a subtle reddish tint. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
