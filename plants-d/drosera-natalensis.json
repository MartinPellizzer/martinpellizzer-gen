    "intro": "Drosera natalensis, commonly known as Natal Sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant's leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called tentacles, which secrete a mucilaginous substance to immobilize prey. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and fens, and is often found in shaded areas. Drosera natalensis is a low-growing plant that typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters."
