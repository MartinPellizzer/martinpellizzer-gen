    "intro": "Dactylorchis traunsteineri var. rhombilabris, commonly known as the rhombic dactylorchis, is a rare orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique rhomboid-shaped labellum, which distinguishes it from other varieties within the genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect light. Its flowers are small and delicate, with a complex structure typical of orchids, featuring specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native regions."
