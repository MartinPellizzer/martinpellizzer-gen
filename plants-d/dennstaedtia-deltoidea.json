    "intro": "Dennstaedtia deltoidea, commonly known as the delta fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its deltoid-shaped fronds, which are typically divided into two lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to parts of North America, particularly the eastern United States, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in water retention. The delta fern is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
