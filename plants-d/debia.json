    "intro": "Debia, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, long-lasting flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, with stems that often root at the nodes. Debia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
