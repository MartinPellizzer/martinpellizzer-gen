    "intro": "Delphinium batangense, commonly known as the Batang larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool and moist environments. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated edges, and the flowers are showy, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
