    "intro": "Dodecatheon conjugens f. lacteum, commonly known as the milkflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. The f. lacteum form is distinguished by its milky sap and more elongated floral structure compared to the typical form."
