It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and swamps, and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. Its flowering stems are often erect and bear spikelets that are tightly packed, contributing to its ornamental value. Dicrastylis soliparma plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
