It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, often found in savannas and woodlands. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of fuel."
