    "intro": "Dryopteris malacothrix, commonly known as the blackfoot fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, glossy fronds that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth."
