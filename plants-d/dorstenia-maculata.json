    "intro": "Dorstenia maculata, commonly known as the spotted milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped leaves that are often spotted or streaked with contrasting colors. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is known for its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals. Dorstenia maculata thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and collections."
