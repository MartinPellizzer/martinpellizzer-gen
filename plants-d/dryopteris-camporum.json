    "intro": "Dryopteris camporum, commonly known as the wood fern, is a perennial fern native to North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help it spread vegetatively. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
