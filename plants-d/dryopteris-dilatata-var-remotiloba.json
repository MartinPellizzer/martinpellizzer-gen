    "intro": "Dryopteris dilatata var. remotiloba, commonly known as the remote fern, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically lighter in color compared to the standard variety. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense colonies over time. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic foliage."
