    "intro": "Dendrobium cyanopterum, commonly known as the blue-veined orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It features a sympodial growth habit with a caudex and multiple pseudobulbs covered in a dense, fibrous root system. The plant produces showy, spurred orchid flowers in shades of blue and purple, often with a distinctive white or pale pink lip. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
