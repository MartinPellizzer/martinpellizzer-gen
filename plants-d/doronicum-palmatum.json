    "intro": "Doronicum palmatum, commonly known as the golden-skyflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the top of its slender stems. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. Doronicum palmatum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. It is also known for its ability to tolerate partial shade and is relatively low maintenance once established."
