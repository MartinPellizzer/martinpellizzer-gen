    "intro": "Dicoma welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia mirabilis, is a unique succulent plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia. It is characterized by its two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant has a thick, woody stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the early morning. Dicoma welwitschii is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back over 100 million years."
