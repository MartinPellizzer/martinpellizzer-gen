    "intro": "Dalea glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and shrublands. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Dalea glandulosa plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinators."
