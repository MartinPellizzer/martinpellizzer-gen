    "intro": "Danthonia patula var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf danthonia, is a low-growing grass species native to parts of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact inflorescences. This variety is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like blades and small, spike-like flower clusters. It is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
