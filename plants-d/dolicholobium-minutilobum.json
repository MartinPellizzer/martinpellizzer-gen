    "intro": "Dolicholobium minutilobum, commonly known as the small-lobed dolicholobium, is a lesser-known species within the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, climbing habit and trifoliate leaves with finely divided lobes. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in racemate inflorescences, typical of many legumes. Its fruits are legumes that mature into dry pods containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is of interest to botanists studying plant diversity and ecological niches."
