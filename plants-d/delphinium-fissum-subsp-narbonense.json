    "intro": "Delphinium fissum subsp. narbonense, commonly known as the Narrowleaf larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a hairy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It is also noted for its toxicity, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock and humans."
