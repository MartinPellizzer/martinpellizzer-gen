    "intro": "Diplycosia mantorii, commonly known as the Mantorii mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native Australian eucalyptus trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, yellowish berries. Due to its specific host requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
