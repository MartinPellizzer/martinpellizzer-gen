    "intro": "Dendrorkis puberula, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, which is typical for many orchid species. Dendrorkis puberula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid environments."
