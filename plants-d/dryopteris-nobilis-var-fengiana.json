    "intro": "Dryopteris nobilis var. fengiana, commonly known as the Chinese shield fern, is a variant of the noble shield fern native to China. It is a medium-sized evergreen fern characterized by its broad, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. The fronds are known for their durability and attractive appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
