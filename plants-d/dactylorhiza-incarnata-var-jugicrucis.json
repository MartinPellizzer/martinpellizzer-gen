    "intro": "Dactylorhiza incarnata var. jugicrucis, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet, boggy habitats such as marshes and fens, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender flowering stems with clusters of violet or purple flowers. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged environment, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This orchid is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
