    "intro": "Dimorphandra wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's dimorphandra, is a deciduous tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in dry forest and scrubland habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
