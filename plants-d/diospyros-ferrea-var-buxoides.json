    "intro": "Diospyros ferrea var. buxoides, commonly known as the ironwood boxwood, is a dense, evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible, round berries. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is resistant to decay and used in traditional crafts. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a hedge plant."
