    "intro": "Dudleya saxosa subsp. collomiae, commonly known as the Collom's liveforever, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of Southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
