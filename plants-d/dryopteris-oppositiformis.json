    "intro": "Dryopteris oppositiformis, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by indusia. This fern is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
