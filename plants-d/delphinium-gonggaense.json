It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and mountainous regions, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces follicles as its fruit type. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
