    "intro": "Dryopteris spinulosa var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate wood fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America. It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, upright growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds. The foliage is often a deep green, with a rough, textured surface that gives it a rugged appearance."
