    "intro": "Danthonia pallida var. subracemosa, commonly known as the pale danthonia, is a low-growing grass species native to parts of Australia. It features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in loose, racemose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
