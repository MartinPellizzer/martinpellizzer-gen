    "intro": "Dryopteris prolixa var. bergiana, commonly known as the Bergian wood fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf wood fern native to mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive, deeply divided structure. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with fertile pinnae that bear spore-bearing clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can access adequate moisture and nutrients. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
