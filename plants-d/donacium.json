    "intro": "Donacium, commonly known as the glassworts, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Plumbaginaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal and saline environments, thriving in brackish or saltwater conditions. They are characterized by their succulent, often fleshy leaves and small, blue or violet flowers. Donacium species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh coastal climates. Their unique adaptations make them important indicators of saline soil conditions."
