    "intro": "Darniella melitensis, commonly known as the Maltese thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are covered in stiff, prickle-like structures that deter herbivores. Darniella melitensis produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
