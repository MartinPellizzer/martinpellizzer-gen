    "intro": "Draba asterophora var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded whitlow grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its flowers are typically arranged in a dense cluster at the top of the stem, and the plant is known for its ability to survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions. The variety macrocarpa is distinguished by its larger seeds compared to other varieties of Draba asterophora."
