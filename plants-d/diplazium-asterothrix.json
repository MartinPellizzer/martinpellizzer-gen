    "intro": "Diplazium asterothrix, commonly known as the star-hair fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments with a soft, hairy texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spores are produced in sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
