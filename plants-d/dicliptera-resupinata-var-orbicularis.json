    "intro": "Dicliptera resupinata var. orbicularis, commonly known as the broadleaf grass or African buttonweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a fibrous root system and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically broad and rounded, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they often have a waxy coating. This variant is distinguished by its orbicular leaf shape, which sets it apart from other varieties of Dicliptera. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks."
