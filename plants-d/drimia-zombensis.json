    "intro": "Drimia zombensis, commonly known as the zombie lily, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude grasslands of South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Its unique morphology and association with folklore have made it a subject of both scientific interest and cultural fascination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
