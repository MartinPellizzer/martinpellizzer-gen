    "intro": "Daphne mezereum subsp. mezereum, commonly known as early daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often reddish bark and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Due to its ornamental value and early blooming habit, it is cultivated in gardens despite its toxicity."
