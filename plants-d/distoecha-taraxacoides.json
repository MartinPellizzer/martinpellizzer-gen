    "intro": "Distoecha taraxacoides, commonly known as the sand dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its flowers produce small, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread across sandy and disturbed soils. Distoecha taraxacoides plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
