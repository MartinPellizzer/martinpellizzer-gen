    "intro": "Dracaena dundusanensis, commonly known as the Dundusana dracaena, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae. Native to Madagascar, it is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that are often variegated with yellow and white markings. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
