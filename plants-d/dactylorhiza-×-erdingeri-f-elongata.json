    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 erdingeri f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet or boggy habitats, thriving in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that can reach up to 30 cm in height. This orchid is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem."
