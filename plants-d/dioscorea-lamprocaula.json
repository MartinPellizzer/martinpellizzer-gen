It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by cylindrical, fleshy fruits. Its tuberous roots are the primary part used, though they are not typically cultivated for food. The plant's botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and pharmacological studies."
