    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa subsp. alpicola, commonly known as alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and delicate, feathery seed heads that are often mistaken for wheat or other grasses. This subspecies thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Its growth habit and morphology make it a distinctive feature of alpine meadows and tundra ecosystems."
