    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. ciliatula, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soil in various environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with distinctive hairy margins, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets clustered in dense, cylindrical formations, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often used in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and adaptability to different soil types."
