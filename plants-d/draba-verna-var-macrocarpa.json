    "intro": "Draba verna var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the broad-achene winter cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cross-shaped flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, while the flowers appear in early spring. The varietal name \"macrocarpa\" refers to its relatively large, showy seed pods, which contribute to its distinctive appearance."
