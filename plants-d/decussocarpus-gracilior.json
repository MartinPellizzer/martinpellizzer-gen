    "intro": "Decussocarpus gracilior, commonly known as the slender leafed decussocarpus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
