    "intro": "Dyckia sulphurea, commonly known as the golden dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or yellowish powder, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, yellowish-orange flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
