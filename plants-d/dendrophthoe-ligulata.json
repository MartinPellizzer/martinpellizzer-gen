    "intro": "Dendrophthoe ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host plants. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals. Its life cycle involves both parasitic and autotrophic phases, making it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
