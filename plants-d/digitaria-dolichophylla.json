    "intro": "Digitaria dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf digitaria, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, grasslands, and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings but also plays a role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
