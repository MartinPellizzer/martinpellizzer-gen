    "intro": "Diplazium iridiphyllum, commonly known as the iridescent fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that display a striking iridescent sheen under sunlight. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fertile fronds."
