    "intro": "Dioscorea cuyabensis, commonly known as the Cuyabeno yam, is a member of the Dioscoreaceae family and is native to South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. It is a climbing vine that produces edible tubers, which are rich in starch and have been traditionally used by indigenous communities. The plant has a fibrous root system and hairy stems, with heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it relies on insect pollination for reproduction. The tubers of D. cuyabensis are valued not only for their nutritional content but also for their potential in agricultural and medicinal applications."
