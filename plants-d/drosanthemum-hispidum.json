The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Drosanthemum hispidum is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
