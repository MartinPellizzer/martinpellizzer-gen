    "intro": "Dryopteris davallioides, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features a compact, dense rosette of leathery, dark green fronds that are often adorned with a waxy coating. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in clusters called sori. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
