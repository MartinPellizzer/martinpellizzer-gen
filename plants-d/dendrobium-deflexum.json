    "intro": "Dendrobium deflexum, commonly known as the flexed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without parasitizing them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow with a distinctive, recurved lip. Dendrobium deflexum prefers warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
