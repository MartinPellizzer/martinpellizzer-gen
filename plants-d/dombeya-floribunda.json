    "intro": "Dombeya floribunda, commonly known as the African dombeya, is a deciduous shrub native to South Africa. It features showy, fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged flowering period and drought tolerance."
