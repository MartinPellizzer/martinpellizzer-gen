It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with intricate patterns. Its orchidaceae family characteristics include parallel veins in the leaves and a specialized root system for nutrient absorption. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species."
