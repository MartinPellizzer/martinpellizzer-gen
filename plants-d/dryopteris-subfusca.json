    "intro": "Dryopteris subfusca, commonly known as the rusty wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. The plant features a tall, upright frond with a distinctive rusty-brown coloration on its underside. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The rusty wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
