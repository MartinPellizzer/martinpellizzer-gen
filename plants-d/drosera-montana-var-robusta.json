    "intro": "Drosera montana var. robusta, commonly known as the mountain sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are broad and rosette-shaped, with a dark red or purple coloration. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and moths."
