    "intro": "Doronicum cacaliifolium, commonly known as the alpine leopard's ear, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, heart-shaped leaves that resemble the ears of a leopard, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a vibrant touch to alpine meadows. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Doronicum cacaliifolium is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
