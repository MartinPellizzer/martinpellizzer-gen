    "intro": "Dischidia nummularia var. gracilis, commonly known as the silver vine, is a climbing or trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in clusters. It is often cultivated as a houseplant or in hanging baskets due to its trailing growth habit. Its leaves are also known to be attractive to certain species of cats, which can lead to behavioral issues if not managed."
