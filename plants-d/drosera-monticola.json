    "intro": "Drosera monticola, commonly known as the mountain sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands and bogs of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in cool, shaded environments. Its small white flowers bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display to its insect-trapping foliage. Drosera monticola is a popular species among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and easy care requirements."
