    "intro": "Dracocephalum grandiflorum var. purdomii, commonly known as the Kashmir blue hyssop, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in dense clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates.
