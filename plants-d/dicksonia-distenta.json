    "intro": "Dicksonia distenta, commonly known as the broad-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of spreading, light green fronds that give it a graceful appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. The trunk is covered in a fibrous, spongy material that helps it retain moisture."
