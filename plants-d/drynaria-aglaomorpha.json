    "intro": "Drynaria aglaomorpha, commonly known as the golden tree fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that produces erect, unbranched stems with a distinctive golden-brown coloration. The plant forms a dense, upright trunk covered in a thick layer of old fronds, which are persistent and contribute to its unique appearance. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a leathery texture and a deep green color. This species is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
