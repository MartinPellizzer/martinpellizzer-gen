    "intro": "Dryopteris gracilescens var. calva, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the slender shield fern. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a slender, upright rhizome with lanceolate, serrated fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. This variety is characterized by its distinctive hairy texture and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
