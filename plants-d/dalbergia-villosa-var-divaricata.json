It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and compound leaves with a distinctive variegated pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated pods containing flat, dark seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
