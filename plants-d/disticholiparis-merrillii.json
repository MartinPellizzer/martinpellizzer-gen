    "intro": "Disticholiparis merrillii, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying on its host for nutrients. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows on the branches of native Hawaiian trees such as the \u02bb\u014dhi\u02bba lehua. Due to habitat loss and competition from invasive species, it is considered a vulnerable species."
