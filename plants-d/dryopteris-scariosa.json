    "intro": "Dryopteris scariosa, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that are often covered in a cinnamon-colored, fuzzy coating on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
