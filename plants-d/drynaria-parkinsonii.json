    "intro": "Drynaria parkinsonii, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of Australia. It is characterized by its stout, upright rhizomes and its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of pale, hairy scales. The plant thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often growing on cliffs or in forest understories. Its fronds are typically evergreen, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Drynaria parkinsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
