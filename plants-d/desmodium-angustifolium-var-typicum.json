    "intro": "Desmodium angustifolium var. typicum, commonly known as narrow-leaf burr medic, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with narrow, elongated leaflets and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in forage and soil improvement practices."
