    "intro": "Decodontia, commonly known as the \"gum tree\" or \"stringy bark,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their rough, fissured bark and aromatic leaves. Decodontia species typically have small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody fruits containing seeds. They are often found in dry, sandy soils and are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native habitats."
