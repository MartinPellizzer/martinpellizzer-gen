    "intro": "Dimorphostachys variabilis, commonly known as the variable dimorphostachys, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that consist of both tubular and spurred flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
