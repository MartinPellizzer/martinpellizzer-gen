    "intro": "Dudleya attenuata subsp. orcuttii, commonly known as Orcutt's liveforever, is a succulent plant native to California. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched flowering stalks that bear clusters of yellow flowers in the spring. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
