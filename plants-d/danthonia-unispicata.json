    "intro": "Danthonia unispicata, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry culms that often form dense tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but is often found in moist, well-drained environments. Danthonia unispicata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
