    "intro": "Dicranopteris norrisii, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. The fronds are usually divided into segments with a distinctive, toothed margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens."
