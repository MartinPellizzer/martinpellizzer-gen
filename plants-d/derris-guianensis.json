It is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by long, cylindrical pods. The plant contains the alkaloid rotenone, which is toxic and has been historically used as a natural pesticide. Its roots and stems are often harvested for their medicinal properties. Derris guianensis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in rainforests."
