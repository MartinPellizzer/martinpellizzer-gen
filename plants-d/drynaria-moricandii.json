    "intro": "Drynaria moricandii, commonly known as the Himalayan tree fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Its rhizomes are thick and woody, providing structural support and enabling it to survive in harsh conditions. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
