    "intro": "Dryopteris subcrenulata, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features a rosette of leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive crenulated margin. The plant produces spore-bearing fiddleheads in early spring, which are edible when young. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable conditions."
