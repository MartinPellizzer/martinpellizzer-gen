    "intro": "Daedalacanthus griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's ghost fern, is a rare and elusive fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that exhibit a unique, almost ethereal appearance. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments, often found in dense forest understories where humidity is high. Its reproductive structures, including spores, are small and dispersed through the air, aiding in its propagation in suitable microhabitats. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
