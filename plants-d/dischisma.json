    "intro": "Dischisma, commonly known as the frostweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plants typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Dischisma species are often found in open habitats such as plains, hillsides, and along streambanks. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
