    "intro": "Dichanthium ischaemum subvar. pertusum, commonly known as the curly bluestem, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often rolled at the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This subvariety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in dry conditions."
