    "intro": "Delphinium elatum var. grandifolium, commonly known as the giant larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, supporting large, showy blue to purple flowers. The leaves are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. The plant is also notable for its toxic alkaloids, which make it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
