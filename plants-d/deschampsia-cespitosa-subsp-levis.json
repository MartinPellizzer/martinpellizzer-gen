    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa subsp. levis, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silky-textured leaves and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies is typically found in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense, mat-like clumps. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
