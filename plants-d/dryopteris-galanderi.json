    "intro": "Dryopteris galanderi, commonly known as the Galander's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of Japan and Korea. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces spore-bearing sori on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with high humidity and acidic soil."
