    "intro": "Dianthus glacialis var. acaulis, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant has a rosette of fleshy, grass-like leaves that help it survive in cold, harsh climates. It is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens. Its compact form and vibrant flowers make it a striking addition to alpine landscapes."
