    "intro": "Deutzia scabra var. marmorata, commonly known as the marble-stemmed deutzia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems that display a distinctive mottled or marbled pattern, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on the previous year's growth. Its leaves are typically elliptical, with a slightly hairy texture, and turn yellow in the fall. This variety is valued in gardens for its ornamental stems and delicate floral display."
