    "intro": "Dendropanax nebulosus, commonly known as the misty arrowwood, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or understorey vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
