    "intro": "Drynaria oodes, commonly known as the golden tree fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. Drynaria oodes is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions. Its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens."
