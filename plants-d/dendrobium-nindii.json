    "intro": "Dendrobium nindii, commonly known as the Nind's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces racemes of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Dendrobium nindii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
