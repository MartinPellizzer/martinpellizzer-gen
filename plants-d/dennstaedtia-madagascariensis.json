    "intro": "Dennstaedtia madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascan shield fern, is a species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce erect, bipinnate leaves with a leathery texture. The spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
