    "intro": "Dorstenia contrajerva var. tenuiloba, commonly known as the slender-stalked woolly vine, is a member of the Moraceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically followed by pear-shaped fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is a popular specimen for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
