    "intro": "Durabaculum samoense, commonly known as the Samoan rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the island of Samoa in the South Pacific. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many species of mustard and cress. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers and basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
