    "intro": "Dactylostemon klotzschii f. obovatus, commonly known as the broad-leafed dactylostemon, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its unique leaf morphology. The leaves are typically broad and obovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant often produces small, fragrant flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, arid climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
