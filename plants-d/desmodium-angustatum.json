    "intro": "Desmodium angustatum, commonly known as narrowleaf burr medic, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Desmodium angustatum is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and forage production."
