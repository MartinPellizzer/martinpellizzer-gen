    "intro": "Dryopteris brachypoda, commonly known as the short-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically divided into smaller, serrated segments, giving the plant a delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
