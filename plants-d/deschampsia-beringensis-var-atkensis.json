    "intro": "Deschampsia beringensis var. atkensis, commonly known as the Beringian feathergrass, is a variant of the feathergrass genus native to the northern regions of North America and Siberia. It is a perennial grass characterized by its fine, hair-like foliage and slender, wiry stems. This plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as tundra, wet meadows, and riverbanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Its adaptability to cold climates makes it an important component of Arctic and subarctic ecosystems."
