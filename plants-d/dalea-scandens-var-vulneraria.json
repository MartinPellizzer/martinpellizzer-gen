    "intro": "Dalea scandens var. vulneraria, commonly known as the scarlet prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense patches. Its small, trifoliate leaves and ability to fix nitrogen make it an ecologically important species in native plant communities."
