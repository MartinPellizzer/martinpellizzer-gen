    "intro": "Dontospermum approximatum, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a low shrub, with stems that often root at the nodes. Its flowers are usually brightly colored, ranging from pink to purple, and are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. The leaves are thick and waxy, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat."
