    "intro": "Dryopteris setulosa, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered with short, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective flap known as an indusium."
