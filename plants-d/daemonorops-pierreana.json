    "intro": "Daemonorops pierreana, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a striking member of the cycad family (Cycadaceae). It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. This plant is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The trunk is typically thick and woody, often with a fibrous outer layer. It produces cones rather than flowers, with the male cones releasing pollen that is dispersed by wind."
