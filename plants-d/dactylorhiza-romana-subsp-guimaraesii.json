    "intro": "Dactylorhiza romana subsp. guimaraesii, commonly known as the Guimar\u00e3es orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Portugal. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to grow in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as heaths and grasslands. It has a complex life cycle involving mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
