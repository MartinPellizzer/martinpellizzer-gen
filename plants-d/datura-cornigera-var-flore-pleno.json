    "intro": "Datura cornigera var. flore-pleno, commonly known as the full-flowered nightshade, is a striking perennial herb native to Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, often opening at night. The plant produces toxic, spiny capsules that contain numerous seeds, and its leaves are broad, hairy, and deeply lobed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
