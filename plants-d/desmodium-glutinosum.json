    "intro": "Desmodium glutinosum, commonly known as sticky desmodium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Desmodium glutinosum is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration contexts."
