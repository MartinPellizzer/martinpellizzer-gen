    "intro": "Dactylorchis incarnata var. triangularis, commonly known as the triangular lady's tresses, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and intricate, three-lobed leaves that give it its specific epithet. The plant produces delicate, pale pink to white flowers in a loose raceme, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This orchid is relatively rare and is often protected due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity."
