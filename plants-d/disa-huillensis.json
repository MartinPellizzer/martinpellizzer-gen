    "intro": "Disa huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n Disa, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky habitats, adapting to the cool and humid conditions of its native environment. Its inflorescence consists of a raceme of flowers, with each bloom having three petals and three sepals, typical of orchid morphology. Disa huillensis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
