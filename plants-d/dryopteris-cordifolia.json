    "intro": "Dryopteris cordifolia, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, with a bright green, leathery texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The fern's spores are released from the fertile fronds, which develop in the spring and are typically shorter and narrower than the sterile fronds."
