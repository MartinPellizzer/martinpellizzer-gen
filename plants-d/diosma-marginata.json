It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or pale green margin. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical features make it a notable species in its native habitat, though it is not widely cultivated outside of its natural range."
