    "intro": "Draba \u00d7 setulosa, commonly known as the woolly rockcress, is a hybrid plant species belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to regions of Europe and Asia. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. Its leaves are covered in dense, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Draba \u00d7 setulosa is often found in rocky soils and alpine habitats, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions."
