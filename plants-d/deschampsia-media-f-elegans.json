    "intro": "Deschampsia media f. elegans, commonly known as the elegant feathergrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, silver-gray blades with a distinctive feathery appearance, often forming dense, mat-like clumps. The plant produces delicate, panicle-like inflorescences that are adorned with small, spikelet clusters, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and riverbanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes and ecological restoration projects."
