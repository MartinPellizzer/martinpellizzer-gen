    "intro": "Desmodium indigotinum, commonly known as purple desmodium, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils. Desmodium indigotinum is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
