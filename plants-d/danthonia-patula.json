    "intro": "Danthonia patula, commonly known as the slender danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and heathlands. Danthonia patula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native garden landscapes."
