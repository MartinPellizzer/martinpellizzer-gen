It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, often with hairy stems and foliage. Its flowers are usually bright red or orange, attracting pollinators like birds and insects. Dicera lanceolata is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with mechanisms to store water and reduce transpiration."
