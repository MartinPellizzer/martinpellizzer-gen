It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive central vein. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky habitats. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are leathery and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
