    "intro": "Dendrobium veratroides, commonly known as the orchid with a scent similar to the nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
