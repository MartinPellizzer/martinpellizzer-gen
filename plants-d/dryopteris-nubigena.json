    "intro": "Dryopteris nubigena, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, cloud-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices, where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of fertile fronds that bear spore-producing structures called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right environmental conditions."
