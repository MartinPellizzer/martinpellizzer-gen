It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with fine, wiry leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of many grasses. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
