It features dense, silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast to its clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, oval berries that are typically orange-red in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its showy blooms and compact growth habit, it is often used in borders and containers."
