    "intro": "Dryopteris hunsteiniana, commonly known as the Hunstein's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile and sterile fronds arising from the same rhizome. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
