    "intro": "Dryopteris huberi, commonly known as the Huberi wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually over time. Dryopteris huberi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden landscapes."
