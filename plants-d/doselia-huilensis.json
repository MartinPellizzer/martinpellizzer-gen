    "intro": "Doselia huilensis, commonly known as the Huilensian dosel, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Colombia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Doselia huilensis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
