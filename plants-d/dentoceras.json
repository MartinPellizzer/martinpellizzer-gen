    "intro": "Dentoceras, commonly known as the \"toothed horn,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, tooth-like projections on the calyx, which give it its common name. The plants typically have showy, bell-shaped flowers that can range in color from white to blue or purple. Dentoceras species are often found in moist, temperate regions and thrive in well-drained soils. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
