    "intro": "Dendrolirium kamlangensis, commonly known as the Kamlang orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of delicate, white to pale blue flowers with a distinctive purple throat. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dendrolirium kamlangensis is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanical conservation efforts."
