It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces vibrant pink to red blooms during the spring and summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes.
