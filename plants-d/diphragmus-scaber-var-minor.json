    "intro": "Diphragmus scaber var. minor, commonly known as the roughleaf burrweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, rough bumps. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
