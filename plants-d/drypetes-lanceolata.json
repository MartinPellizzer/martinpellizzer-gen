    "intro": "Drypetes lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf drypetes, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, woody pods containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The tree is valued for its hard timber and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
