    "intro": "Dortmanna rhombifolia, commonly known as the diamond-leaf plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rhomboid-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
