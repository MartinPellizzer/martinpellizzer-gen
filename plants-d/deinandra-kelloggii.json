    "intro": "Deinandra kelloggii, commonly known as the Kellogg's sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or red. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as plains and hillsides. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
