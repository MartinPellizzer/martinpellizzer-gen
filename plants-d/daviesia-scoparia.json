    "intro": "Daviesia scoparia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed broom, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to dry, Mediterranean climates. It has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Daviesia scoparia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
