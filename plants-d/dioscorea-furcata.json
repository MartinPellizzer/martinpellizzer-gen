    "intro": "Dioscorea furcata, commonly known as the forked yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by capsule fruits. Its tubers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits, though they contain toxic compounds that require careful processing."
