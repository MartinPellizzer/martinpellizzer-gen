    "intro": "Dryopteris serra, commonly known as the serrated wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris serra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
