    "intro": "Dryas octopetala subsp. oxyodonta, commonly known as the alpine frostflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This subspecies is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient component of alpine ecosystems."
