    "intro": "Davallia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its distinctive, leathery, lance-shaped fronds. The fronds are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are typically shorter and more rigid than the sterile ones."
