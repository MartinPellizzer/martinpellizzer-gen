    "intro": "Draba incana var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in tight, compact inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
