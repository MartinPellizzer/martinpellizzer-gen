    "intro": "Dryopteris buchananii, commonly known as the Buchanan's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
