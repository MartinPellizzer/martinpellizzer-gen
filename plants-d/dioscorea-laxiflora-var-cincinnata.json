    "intro": "Dioscorea laxiflora var. cincinnata, commonly known as the slender-flowered yam, is a climbing perennial vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that are typically clustered in branched inflorescences. Its tuberous roots are the primary part used, though they are not as widely cultivated as other yam species. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
