    "intro": "Dupatya anthemidiflora, commonly known as the Philippine star orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter in the forest floor. Due to habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under Philippine conservation laws."
