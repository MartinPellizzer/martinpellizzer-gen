    "intro": "Dendrobium exiguum, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thin, leaf-like stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers during the spring or early summer. It prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
