    "intro": "Dendrobium podochiloides, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. Dendrobium podochiloides is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
