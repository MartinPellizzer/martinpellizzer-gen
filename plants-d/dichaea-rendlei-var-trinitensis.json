    "intro": "Dichaea rendlei var. trinitensis, commonly known as the Trinitense Ghost Orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the Caribbean. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees in tropical rainforests. The plant features delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
