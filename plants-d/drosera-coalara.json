    "intro": "Drosera coalara, commonly known as the Coalara Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of southern Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, sticky leaves that trap insects, which are then digested by the plant's secreted enzymes. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires high humidity to flourish. Drosera coalara is a low-maintenance plant that is often grown in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts interested in carnivorous flora."
