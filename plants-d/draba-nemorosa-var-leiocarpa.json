    "intro": "Draba nemorosa var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the silky rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are covered with fine, silky hairs that give it its common name. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to survive in harsh, cold climates."
