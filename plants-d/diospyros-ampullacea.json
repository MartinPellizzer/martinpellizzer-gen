    "intro": "Diospyros ampullacea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule containing several seeds, and the tree is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
