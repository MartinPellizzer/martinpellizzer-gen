It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, Dortmanna tupa has been subject to overharvesting in some regions."
