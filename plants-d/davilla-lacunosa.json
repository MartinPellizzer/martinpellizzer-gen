    "intro": "Davilla lacunosa, commonly known as the laceleaf tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The bark is smooth and may exude a milky sap when damaged."
