    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa f. alpicola, commonly known as alpine feathergrass, is a variant of the common deschampsia grass. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in high-altitude environments. This form is adapted to cold, mountainous regions and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowering stems produce delicate, feathery inflorescences that are typical of the Deschampsia genus. The plant is well-suited to poor soils and is a hardy species that can withstand harsh climatic conditions."
