It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and wetlands. It produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. The leaves are usually alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs."
