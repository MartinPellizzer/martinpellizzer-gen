    "intro": "Dentaria incisa, commonly known as the cutleaf toothplant, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of hairy, toothed leaves that become more deeply lobed as the plant matures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady woodlands and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Dentaria incisa is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
