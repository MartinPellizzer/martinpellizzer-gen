It is characterized by its distinctive bark, which is thick and fissured, and its ability to thrive in brackish water environments. The plant has pinnately compound leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapting to its coastal habitat. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing single seeds. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
