    "intro": "Delphinium altaicum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense spikes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Delphinium altaicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high elevation requirements."
