    "intro": "Diplodium alveatum, commonly known as the hollow-stemmed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that are often ribbed and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically in early to mid-summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface. Diplodium alveatum is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
