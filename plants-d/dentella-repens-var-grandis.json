It is characterized by its long, trailing stems that can reach several meters in length, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. The plant produces clusters of showy, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, toothed appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to bloom reliably in cooler climates."
