    "intro": "Dendroglossa zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon tree toad, is a species of tree frog native to Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its robust body, warty skin, and distinctive coloration that varies between males and females. The plant aspect of this species refers to its habitat in tropical rainforests, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. It typically resides in the canopy layer of trees, using its strong limbs to climb and navigate through the foliage. The species plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to seed dispersal and serving as prey for larger animals."
