It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and alternate, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Doosera esculenta is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats. Its latex contains irritants, so it should be handled with care."
