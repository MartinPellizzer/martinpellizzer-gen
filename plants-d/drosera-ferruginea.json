    "intro": "Drosera ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, reddish stems and sticky, glandular leaves that trap insects. The plant's leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called tentacles, which secrete a digestive enzyme-laden mucilage to immobilize prey. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. The rusty sundew is known for its ability to absorb nutrients from captured insects, supplementing its nutrient-poor habitat."
