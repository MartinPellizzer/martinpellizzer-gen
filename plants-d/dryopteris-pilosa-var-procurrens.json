    "intro": "Dryopteris pilosa var. procurrens, commonly known as the spreading wood fern, is a variant of the broadleaf wood fern native to North America. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are typically light to medium green in color. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, serrated or toothed margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are essential for its reproductive cycle."
