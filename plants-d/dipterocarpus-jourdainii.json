    "intro": "Dipterocarpus jourdainii, commonly known as the Jourdain's dipterocarp, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and smooth, gray bark. The plant produces heavy, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common trait among dipterocarps. It thrives in lowland rainforests and plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of these ecosystems. The species is also valued for its durable wood, which has been historically used in construction and furniture."
