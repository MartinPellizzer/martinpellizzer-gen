    "intro": "Dracaena fragrans f. wacheana, commonly known as the \"Massangeana\" variety, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features narrow, dark green, sword-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow margins, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries, which are edible for birds but not typically for humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
