    "intro": "Dendrobium pseudokraemeri, commonly known as the golden torch orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures rather than in soil. The plant produces striking, yellow-orange flowers that are often clustered in racemes, giving it a dramatic appearance. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, adapted for efficient water absorption in its natural habitat. Dendrobium pseudokraemeri thrives in humid, tropical environments with bright, indirect light."
