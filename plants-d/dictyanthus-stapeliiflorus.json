    "intro": "Dictyanthus stapeliiflorus, commonly known as the woolly stemmed lantern. This succulent plant is native to South Africa and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The leaves are typically small, rounded, and also covered in a similar coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are often yellow or orange in color. The plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
