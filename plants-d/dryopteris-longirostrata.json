    "intro": "Dryopteris longirostrata, commonly known as the long-crested wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It prefers moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
