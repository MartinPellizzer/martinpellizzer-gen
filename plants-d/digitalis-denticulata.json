    "intro": "Digitalis denticulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved foxglove, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features tall, erect stems with whorled, lance-shaped leaves that have finely serrated edges. The plant produces striking bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple or pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Digitalis denticulata is part of the Plantaginaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. However, like other foxgloves, it contains toxic cardiac glycosides, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals."
