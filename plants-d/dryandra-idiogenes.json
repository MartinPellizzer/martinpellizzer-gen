    "intro": "Dryandra idiogenes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dryandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Proteaceae. It is native to Western Australia, where it typically grows in sandy soils within dry, open woodlands. The plant is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and its striking, cone-shaped inflorescences that bear small, yellow flowers. It is a shrub that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, and it is well adapted to the arid conditions of its natural habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
