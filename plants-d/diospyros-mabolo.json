    "intro": "Diospyros mabolo, commonly known as lambanog mango or chico de tango, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, orange-red fruits with a sweet, mealy flesh. The fruit is often used in traditional Filipino cuisine and has a distinct flavor profile that sets it apart from other mango varieties. Its botanical features make it a valuable species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
