    "intro": "Dendrobium ambotiense, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and it produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with bright, indirect light. Dendrobium ambotiense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
