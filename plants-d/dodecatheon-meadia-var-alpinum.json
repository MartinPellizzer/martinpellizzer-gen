    "intro": "Dodecatheon meadia var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy and slightly woody at the base. This variant is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth form compared to the typical variety of Dodecatheon meadia."
