    "intro": "Doryopteris articulata, commonly known as the articulated fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive, segmented fronds that give it a unique, almost architectural appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, ovate pinnae that are arranged in a regular, alternating pattern. Doryopteris articulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
