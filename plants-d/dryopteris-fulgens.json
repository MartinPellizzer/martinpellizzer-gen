    "intro": "Dryopteris fulgens, commonly known as the flame fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange to red fronds that are often described as resembling flames. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
