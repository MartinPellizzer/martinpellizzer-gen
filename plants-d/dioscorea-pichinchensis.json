    "intro": "Dioscorea pichinchensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian yam, is a climbing vine native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and has compound leaves with three to five leaflets. Its tubers are rich in starch and have been traditionally used in local cuisines. The species is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to validate its therapeutic uses."
