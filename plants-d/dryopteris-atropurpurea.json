    "intro": "Dryopteris atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple fern, is a species of polypody fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark purple to bronze-colored fronds that often turn green as they mature. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give the plant a delicate, feathery appearance."
