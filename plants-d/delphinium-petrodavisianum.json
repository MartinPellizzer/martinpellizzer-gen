    "intro": "Delphinium petrodavisianum, commonly known as the Petrodavisian Larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are notable for their spurred petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
