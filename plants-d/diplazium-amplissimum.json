It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give it a dense, fern-like appearance. Diplazium amplissimum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture and landscape design."
