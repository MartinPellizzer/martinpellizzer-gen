    "intro": "Dalbergia louvelii, commonly known as the Madagascar rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its quality. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
