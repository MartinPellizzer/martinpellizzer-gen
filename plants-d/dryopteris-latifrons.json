    "intro": "Dryopteris latifrons, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and horizontal, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
