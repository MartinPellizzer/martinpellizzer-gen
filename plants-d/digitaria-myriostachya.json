    "intro": "Digitaria myriostachya, commonly known as giant panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth and can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with long, slender bracts. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that makes it resilient to grazing and environmental stress. Digitaria myriostachya is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage and erosion control."
