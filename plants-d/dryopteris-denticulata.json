    "intro": "Dryopteris denticulata, commonly known as the finely toothed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, serrated teeth along the edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in compact, club-shaped sorus structures on the underside of the fronds."
