    "intro": "Dendrobium pseudoglomeratum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, pendulous inflorescences with numerous yellow to golden-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its pseudobulbs are thick and segmented, storing water and nutrients. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
