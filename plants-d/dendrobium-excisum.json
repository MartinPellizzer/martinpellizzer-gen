    "intro": "Dendrobium excisum, commonly known as the cut-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that are often covered in clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium excisum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
