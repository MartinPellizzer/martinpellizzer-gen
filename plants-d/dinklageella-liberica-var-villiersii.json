It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, with leaves that are rounded and often colored in shades of green, purple, or silver. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The flowers, which come in a variety of colors, bloom throughout the year under proper care."
