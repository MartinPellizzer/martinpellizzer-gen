    "intro": "Dipterocarpus basilanicus, commonly known as the Malay ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, sturdy trunk and thick, bark-like outer layer that provides protection against pests and environmental stress. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its dense wood, it is highly valued for construction and furniture-making, though its habitat is threatened by deforestation."
