    "intro": "Dendrophorbium azoguesense, commonly known as the Azogues orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are often pale green or yellowish, with a subtle fragrance, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
