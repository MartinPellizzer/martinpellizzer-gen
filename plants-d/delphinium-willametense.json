    "intro": "Delphinium willametense, commonly known as the Willamette delphinium, is a tall, erect perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features showy blue to purple spires of flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, providing a striking visual contrast to its vibrant flower spikes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in moist, woodland habitats. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
