    "intro": "Diacranthera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, often yellow or red, flowers. Diacranthera species are often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and riverbanks. Some species are considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
