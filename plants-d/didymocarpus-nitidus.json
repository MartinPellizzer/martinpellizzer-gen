    "intro": "Didymocarpus nitidus, commonly known as the shining banyan, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, and often smooth bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
