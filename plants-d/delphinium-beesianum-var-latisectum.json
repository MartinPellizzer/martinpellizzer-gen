    "intro": "Delphinium beesianum var. latisectum, commonly known as the broad-leaf larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of cobalt-blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance, contributing to its ornamental value. This variety is particularly noted for its wide, broad leaves, which set it apart from other larkspur species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
