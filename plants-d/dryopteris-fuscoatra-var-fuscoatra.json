    "intro": "Dryopteris fuscoatra var. fuscoatra, commonly known as the blackfoot fern, is a shade-loving evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It features dark, leathery fronds with a distinctive blackish-brown coloration on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in woodland environments. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a graceful, arching appearance that adds ornamental value to shaded gardens."
