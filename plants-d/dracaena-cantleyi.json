    "intro": "Dracaena cantleyi, commonly known as the Cantley's dracaena, is a rare and unique species native to the island of Madagascar. It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in rocky or limestone outcrops. Its ornamental value has led to increased interest in its conservation and cultivation."
