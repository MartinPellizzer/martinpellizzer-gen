    "intro": "Diplocaulobium regale, commonly known as the royal diplocaulobium, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or stream banks. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions."
