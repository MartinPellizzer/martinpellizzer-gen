    "intro": "Delphinium tanguticum, commonly known as the Tangut larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers are showy, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
