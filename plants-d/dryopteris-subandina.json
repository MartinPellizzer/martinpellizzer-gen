    "intro": "Dryopteris subandina, commonly known as the Andean wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Andes mountains. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Dryopteris subandina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
