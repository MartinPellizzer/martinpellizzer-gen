    "intro": "Dendrobium uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a slender, branching stem that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces a single, showy flower per inflorescence, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged spirally around the stem. Dendrobium uniflorum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
