    "intro": "Dorychnium angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved burrweed, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, often with a hairy texture. Dorychnium angustifolium produces distinctive burrs that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing."
