    "intro": "Deprea kann-rasmussenii, commonly known as the Rasmussen's deprea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in specialized botanical gardens. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
