It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear a fine, hairy coating. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced in dry conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a single, slender spikelet that is often adorned with short, bristly hairs. This plant is well adapted to disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides."
