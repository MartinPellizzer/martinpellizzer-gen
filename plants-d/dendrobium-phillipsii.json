    "intro": "Dendrobium phillipsii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with red or orange markings, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Dendrobium phillipsii is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
