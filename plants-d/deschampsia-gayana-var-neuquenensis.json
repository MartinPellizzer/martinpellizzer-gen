It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
