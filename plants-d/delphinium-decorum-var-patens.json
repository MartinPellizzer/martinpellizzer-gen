    "intro": "Delphinium decorum var. patens, commonly known as the spreading larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features tall, slender stems that produce clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and children."
