    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sambucina var. laurentina, commonly known as the Laurentian marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and marshes. The plant features a slender, erect stem with few leaves and produces clusters of pale green or yellowish flowers. Its roots are highly specialized for absorbing nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils in which it thrives. This orchid is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is often found in association with other bog specialists."
