    "intro": "Diphasia noldeae, commonly known as the Nolde's diphasia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive two-part flower structure, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are usually small and bell-shaped, displaying a range of colors from white to pale blue, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Diphasia noldeae is considered a vulnerable species."
