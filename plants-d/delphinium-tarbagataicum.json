    "intro": "Delphinium tarbagataicum, commonly known as the Tarbagatai larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in raceme-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, typical of many delphinium species. Delphinium tarbagataicum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
