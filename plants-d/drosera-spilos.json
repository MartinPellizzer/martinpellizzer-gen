It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, acidic environments and is often found in heathlands and wetlands. Drosera spilos is a carnivorous plant that relies on insect prey for essential nutrients."
