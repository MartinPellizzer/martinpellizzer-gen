    "intro": "Ditrysinia fruticosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties, making it important in traditional crafts and medicine. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many areas."
