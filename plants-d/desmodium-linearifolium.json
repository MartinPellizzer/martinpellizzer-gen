    "intro": "Desmodium linearifolium, commonly known as slender ticktrefoil, is a leguminous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a sprawling growth habit and produces small, round seeds enclosed in hairy pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields. Desmodium linearifolium is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
