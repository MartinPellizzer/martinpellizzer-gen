    "intro": "Dendrobium subuliferum, commonly known as the needle-leaf dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with short, wiry stems covered in small, pointed leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium subuliferum is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
