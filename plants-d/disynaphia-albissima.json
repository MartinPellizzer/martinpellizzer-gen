    "intro": "Disynaphia albissima, commonly known as the white-stemmed broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a root system composed of haustoria, which penetrate the roots of its host to extract water and minerals. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, often parasitizing grasses and shrubs. Due to its lack of visible leaves and reliance on hosts, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
