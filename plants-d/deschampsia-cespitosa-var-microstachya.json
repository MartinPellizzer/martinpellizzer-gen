    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa var. microstachya, commonly known as bluejoint grass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that are typically blue to purple in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
