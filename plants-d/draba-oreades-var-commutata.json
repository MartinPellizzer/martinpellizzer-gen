    "intro": "Draba oreades var. commutata, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal and rosette-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture. This variety is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Draba oreades."
