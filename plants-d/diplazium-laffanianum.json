    "intro": "Diplazium laffanianum, commonly known as the Laffan's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit. The plant features rhizomes that produce both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Its foliage is typically dark green and leathery, adapted to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Diplazium laffanianum is often found in tropical and subtropical forests, where it contributes to the undergrowth vegetation."
