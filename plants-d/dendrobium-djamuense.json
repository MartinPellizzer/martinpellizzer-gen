It is characterized by its erect, branched stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white or pale green hair. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically blooming during the wet season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the rich, humid soil. Dendrobium djamuense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
