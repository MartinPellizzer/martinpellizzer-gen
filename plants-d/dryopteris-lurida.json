    "intro": "Dryopteris lurida, commonly known as the rusty wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that often have a reddish or rusty hue, especially along the margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
