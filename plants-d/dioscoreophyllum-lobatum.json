It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a rhizomatous stem system, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a smooth, waxy surface, while its flowers are clustered in spadices, a characteristic feature of the Araceae family. The plant is also known for its edible tubers, which are used in traditional cuisines across parts of Africa."
