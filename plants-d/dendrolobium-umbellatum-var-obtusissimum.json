    "intro": "Dendrolobium umbellatum var. obtusissimum, commonly known as the broad-leafed burr vetch, is a perennial legume native to Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with broad, ovate leaflets and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant has a woody stem and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, spiny pod, which aids in seed dispersal. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil rehabilitation and as a forage plant."
