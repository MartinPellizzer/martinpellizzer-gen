    "intro": "Dendrobium taurulinum, commonly known as the Tauruliense orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium taurulinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral display."
