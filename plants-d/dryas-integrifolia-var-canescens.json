    "intro": "Dryas integrifolia var. canescens, commonly known as the alpine wooly-leaf mountain avens, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or grayish foliage that helps insulate it against harsh cold and wind. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
