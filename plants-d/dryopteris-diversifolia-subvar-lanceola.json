    "intro": "Dryopteris diversifolia subvar. lanceola, commonly known as the lanceolate wood fern, is a variant of the variable wood fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, fertile fronds that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of the typical variety. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its fronds are dark green and have a distinctive, finely divided structure with a leathery texture. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and light conditions."
