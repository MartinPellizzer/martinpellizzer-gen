    "intro": "Draba elongata var. skrivanekii, commonly known as the Skrivanek's whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense mats of slender, leafy stems with small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant prefers rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are usually white or pale yellow. This variety is noted for its horticultural value and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens for its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
