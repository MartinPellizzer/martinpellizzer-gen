    "intro": "Dorstenia mariae, commonly known as the Marie's zigzag plant, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, spiraling stems that twist and curl as it grows. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Dorstenia mariae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its intriguing growth form and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
