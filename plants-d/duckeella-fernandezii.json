    "intro": "Duckeella fernandezii, commonly known as the Fern\u00e1ndez's duckweed, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae. It is characterized by its simple, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant lacks true roots and stems, instead relying on rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can form dense mats on the water surface, influencing local ecosystems."
