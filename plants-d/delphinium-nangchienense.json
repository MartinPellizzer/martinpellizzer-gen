It is a herbaceous perennial that produces tall, sparsely branched stems covered in dense, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky areas, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are composed of two lips, with the upper lip being shorter and the lower lip longer, a characteristic feature of the delphinium genus.
