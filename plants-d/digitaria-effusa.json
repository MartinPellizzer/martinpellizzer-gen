    "intro": "Digitaria effusa, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, often branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is both a common weed and a forage plant for livestock."
