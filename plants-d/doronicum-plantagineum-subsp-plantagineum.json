    "intro": "Doronicum plantagineum subsp. plantagineum, commonly known as the alpine avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features basal leaves that are kidney-shaped with hairy surfaces, and it produces clusters of small, yellow, bell-shaped flowers in early summer. Its flowers are usually arranged in a terminal cyme and are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
