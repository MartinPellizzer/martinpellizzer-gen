    "intro": "Dioscorea sabarensis, commonly known as the Sabaransis yam, is a tropical climbing plant belonging to the family Dioscoreaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces tuberous roots that are often used as a food source, similar to other yam species. Its leaves are heart-shaped and large, with a rough texture, while its flowers are small and unisexual. The plant is valued both for its nutritional content and its potential medicinal properties."
