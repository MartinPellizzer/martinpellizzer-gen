It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple spires of flowers, which are typically arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are long, lance-shaped, and covered with a fine, silky down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens and rockeries."
