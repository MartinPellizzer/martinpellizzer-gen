    "intro": "Dendrobium speciosum var. carnarvonense, commonly known as the Carnarvon orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Australia. It features a tall, branched stem with numerous pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, typically arranged in two rows along the stem. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
