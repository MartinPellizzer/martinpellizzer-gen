    "intro": "Davilla sessilifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or red bay, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to South America. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
