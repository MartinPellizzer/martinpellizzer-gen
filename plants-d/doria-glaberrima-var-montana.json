    "intro": "Doria glaberrima var. montana, commonly known as the mountain doria, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, velvety texture, which helps protect it from harsh mountain climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
