    "intro": "Daphne salicifolia, commonly known as silverleaf daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features slender, willow-like leaves that are covered in a silvery-white bloom, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. However, it is toxic to humans and animals, requiring caution in cultivation."
