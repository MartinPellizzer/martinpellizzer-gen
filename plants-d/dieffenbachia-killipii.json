    "intro": "Dieffenbachia killipii, commonly known as the Killipii Dieffenbachia, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, arrow-shaped leaves that are often adorned with striking white or cream-colored markings. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, which includes other popular houseplants like peace lilies and calla lilies. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care and kept away from pets and children."
