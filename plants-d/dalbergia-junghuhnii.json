    "intro": "Dalbergia junghuhnii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces hard, dark wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
