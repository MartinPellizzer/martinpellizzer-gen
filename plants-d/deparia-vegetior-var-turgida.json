The fronds are usually arranged in a compact rosette, providing a dense, shield-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in woodland gardens and shaded rockeries. The plant is noted for its resilience and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions, though it prefers well-drained, fertile soils."
