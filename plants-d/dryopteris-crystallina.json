    "intro": "Dryopteris crystallina, commonly known as the crystal fern, is a species of polypody fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in tiny, translucent, waxy scales, giving it a crystalline appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional herbal medicine. The fronds are usually evergreen, remaining green throughout the year, which contributes to its ornamental value in gardens."
