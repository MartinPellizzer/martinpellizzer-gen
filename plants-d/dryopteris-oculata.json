    "intro": "Dryopteris oculata, commonly known as the eye fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with small, eye-like structures called sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while spreading new growth. Dryopteris oculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and shaded landscapes."
