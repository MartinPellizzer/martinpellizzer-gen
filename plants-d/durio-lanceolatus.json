    "intro": "Durio lanceolatus, commonly known as the lanceolate durian, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, spiky fruit, which is similar to the more well-known durian species. The plant produces showy, yellowish flowers that are typically borne in clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hence the species name, and are usually alternate along the stem. The fruit contains a creamy, aromatic pulp that is highly valued in local cuisines."
