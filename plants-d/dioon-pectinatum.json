    "intro": "Dioon pectinatum, commonly known as the Mexican palm or the pectinata palm, is a cycad species native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces distinctive, cone-like structures known as strobili, which contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
