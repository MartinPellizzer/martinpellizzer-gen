    "intro": "Dendrobium auricolor var. minor, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, cane-like structure with clustered, lance-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that have a subtle fragrance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its attractive, long-lasting blooms."
