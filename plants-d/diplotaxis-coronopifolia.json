    "intro": "Diplotaxis coronopifolia, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny conditions. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control. Diplotaxis coronopifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
