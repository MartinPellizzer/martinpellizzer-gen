    "intro": "Discaria aphylla, commonly known as the leafless discaria, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring small, clustered flowers and a lack of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often covered in a powdery coating, which may serve as a protective adaptation. Discaria aphylla is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
