    "intro": "Davallia divergens, commonly known as the resurrection fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its ability to survive extreme desiccation. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant's fronds are leathery and have a distinctive, delicate appearance with a zigzag pattern along the veins. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is notable for its resilience and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
