    "intro": "Delphinium shawurense var. shawurense, commonly known as the Shawuren delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features tall, erect stems that bear clusters of striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and botanical collections."
