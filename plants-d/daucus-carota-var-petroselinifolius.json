    "intro": "Daucus carota var. petroselinifolius, commonly known as parsley carrot or parsnip carrot, is a variant of the wild carrot plant. It is characterized by its finely divided, parsley-like leaves that are often mistaken for true parsley. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are typically smaller and less fleshy compared to the common carrot. This variety is often cultivated for its aromatic foliage rather than its root."
