    "intro": "Desmiograstis, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique member of the Dryopteridaceae family, characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's fronds are typically bipinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a ghostly appearance. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
