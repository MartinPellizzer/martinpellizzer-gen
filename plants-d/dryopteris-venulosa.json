    "intro": "Dryopteris venulosa, commonly known as the veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a subtle veining pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Dryopteris venulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
