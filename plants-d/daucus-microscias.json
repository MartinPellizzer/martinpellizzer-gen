    "intro": "Daucus microscias, commonly known as the smallflower carrot, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. The plant features slender stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other carrots, though it is not closely related to the edible carrot species. Daucus microscias is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
