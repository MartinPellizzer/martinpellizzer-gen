    "intro": "Drosera aberrans, commonly known as the variable sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested to provide nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It has a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape depending on environmental conditions. Drosera aberrans is known for its adaptability and is often found in diverse habitats across the Australian continent."
