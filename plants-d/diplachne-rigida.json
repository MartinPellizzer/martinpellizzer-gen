    "intro": "Diplachne rigida, commonly known as rigid flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, flat blades that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces inflorescences that are spike-like and composed of small, two-ranked spikelets. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Diplachne rigida is known for its ability to form extensive mats, which can impact native vegetation in certain environments."
