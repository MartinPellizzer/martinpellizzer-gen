    "intro": "Diploglottis diphyllostegia, commonly known as the two-leafed glottis plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive two-leaved structure at the base of its stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are broad and have a glossy surface, while its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
