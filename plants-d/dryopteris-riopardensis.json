    "intro": "Dryopteris riopardensis, commonly known as the Riopardensis wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
