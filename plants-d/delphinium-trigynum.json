    "intro": "Delphinium trigynum, commonly known as the three-flowered larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are alternate along the stem, and its flowers typically have three sepals and three petals, giving it the \"trigynum\" name, meaning three-styled. Delphinium trigynum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental beauty but is toxic to livestock and humans due to its alkaloid content."
