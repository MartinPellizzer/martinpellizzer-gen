    "intro": "Dendrobium dekockii, commonly known as the Dekock's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to South Africa. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish-red hairs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. Dendrobium dekockii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
