    "intro": "Dryopteris unca, commonly known as the creeping wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they often have a slightly curled or twisted base. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soil. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its unique foliage."
