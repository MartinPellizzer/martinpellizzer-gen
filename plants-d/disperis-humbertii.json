    "intro": "Disperis humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical features include long, narrow leaves and a slender stem that supports its delicate, fragrant blossoms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
