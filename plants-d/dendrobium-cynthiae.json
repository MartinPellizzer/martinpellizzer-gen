    "intro": "Dendrobium cynthiae, commonly known as the Cynthia's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in varying environmental conditions."
