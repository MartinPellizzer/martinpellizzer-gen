    "intro": "Dracula cochliops, commonly known as the vampire orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, velvety leaves and intricate, claw-like structures that resemble the claws of a bat or a vampire. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat destruction, it is also considered an endangered species."
