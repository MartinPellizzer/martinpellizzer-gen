    "intro": "Danthonia forskaolii, commonly known as the goldenhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces dense, golden-colored inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive silver-blue hue on the underside. Danthonia forskaolii is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soils."
