    "intro": "Digitaria nealleyi, commonly known as Nealley's Digitaria, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow with a smooth surface. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, bract-like structures that bear the flowering parts. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
