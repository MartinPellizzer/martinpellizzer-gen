    "intro": "Daphne uva-ursi var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural areas."
