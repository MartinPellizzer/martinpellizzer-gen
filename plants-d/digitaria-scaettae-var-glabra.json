    "intro": "Digitaria scaettae var. glabra, commonly known as smooth digitaria, is a grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
