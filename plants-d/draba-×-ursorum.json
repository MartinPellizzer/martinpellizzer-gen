    "intro": "Draba \u00d7 ursorum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a hybrid species within the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, where it is adapted to cold, rocky soils and high elevations. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention and protection from harsh weather. Draba \u00d7 ursorum is often found in mountainous regions of Europe and is considered a rare and endemic species in certain areas."
