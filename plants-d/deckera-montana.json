    "intro": "Deckera montana, commonly known as the mountain decker, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale blue, which bloom in late summer. Deckera montana thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy choice for alpine gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and prolonged flowering period."
