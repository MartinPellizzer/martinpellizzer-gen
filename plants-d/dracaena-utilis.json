    "intro": "Dracaena utilis, commonly known as the dragon tree, is a tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, strap-like leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by bright red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Dracaena utilis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying qualities. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
