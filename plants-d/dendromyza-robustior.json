    "intro": "Dendromyza robustior, commonly known as the robust tree fern, is a striking member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in rich, well-drained soil. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their aesthetic and functional properties."
