    "intro": "Draba suffruticosa, commonly known as the dwarf whitlow grass, is a low-growing flowering plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Draba suffruticosa is an important component of alpine vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization and providing nectar for pollinators."
