    "intro": "Dalea bechtelii, commonly known as the Bechtel's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Dalea bechtelii is also valued for its role in supporting local biodiversity and its potential use in restoration ecology."
