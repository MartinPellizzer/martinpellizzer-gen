    "intro": "Dyckia pottiorum, commonly known as the Pott's dyckia, is a compact, evergreen bromeliad native to Brazil. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly fibers. The plant produces striking, red-brown inflorescences that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dyckia pottiorum is well-suited for indoor cultivation and adds an elegant, architectural presence to any collection."
