    "intro": "Drosera rupicola, commonly known as the rock sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and is adapted to nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette shape. Drosera rupicola is a small, compact plant that produces delicate pink or red flowers during the growing season."
