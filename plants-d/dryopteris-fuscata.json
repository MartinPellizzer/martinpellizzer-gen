    "intro": "Dryopteris fuscata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, dark brown, cinnamon-colored fiddleheads that unfurl into lush, dark green fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to two meters, with a feathery, compound structure. The cinnamon fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
