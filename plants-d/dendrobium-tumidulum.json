It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its tropical and subtropical habitats. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium tumidulum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
