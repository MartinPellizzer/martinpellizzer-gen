    "intro": "Dianthus karataviensis, commonly known as the Karatavi pink, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
