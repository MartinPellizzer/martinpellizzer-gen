    "intro": "Dendrobium rimannii, commonly known as the Riemann's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Dendrobium rimannii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ease of cultivation."
