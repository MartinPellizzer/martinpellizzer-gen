    "intro": "Digitalis ambigua, commonly known as the purple foxglove, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, making it both toxic and medicinally significant. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are typically arranged in loose racemes. Digitalis ambigua is often found in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
