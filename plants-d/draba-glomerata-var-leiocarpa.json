    "intro": "Draba glomerata var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-capsule whitlow grass, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal rosettes of linear, glaucous leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by rounded, smooth capsules. It is native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia, thriving in rocky, well-drained soils. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous seed capsules, which set it apart from other varieties of Draba glomerata."
