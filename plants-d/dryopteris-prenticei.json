    "intro": "Dryopteris prenticei, commonly known as Prentice's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
