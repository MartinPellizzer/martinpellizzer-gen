    "intro": "Daphne ovata, commonly known as the oval daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring careful handling."
