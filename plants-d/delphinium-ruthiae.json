    "intro": "Delphinium ruthiae, commonly known as Ruth's larkspur, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its flowers are tubular with five reflexed petals, and it produces small, dark seeds in follicles. Delphinium ruthiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be toxic to livestock."
