    "intro": "Dendrobium \u00d7 benita, commonly known as the Benita orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, often blooming during the summer months. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Dendrobium \u00d7 benita is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
