    "intro": "Dendrobium citrinocastaneum, commonly known as the golden-brown dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive golden-brown hue, and bloom during the dry season. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
