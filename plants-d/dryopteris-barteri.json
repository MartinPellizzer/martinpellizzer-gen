    "intro": "Dryopteris barteri, commonly known as the Barter's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Dryopteris barteri is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
