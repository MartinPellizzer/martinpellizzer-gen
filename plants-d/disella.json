    "intro": "Disella, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to southern Africa. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lobed or toothed, and they produce small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads. Disella species are often found in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens."
