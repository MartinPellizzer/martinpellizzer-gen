    "intro": "Dichocarpum carinatum, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and bears small, pink or white flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems. Dichocarpum carinatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
