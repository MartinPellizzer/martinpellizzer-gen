    "intro": "Dicranostyles ampla var. castanea, commonly known as the chestnut-leafed dicranostyles, is a variant of the dicranostyles genus native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, chestnut-brown leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a unique structure that facilitates wind pollination. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its morphological differences from the typical form of Dicranostyles ampla."
