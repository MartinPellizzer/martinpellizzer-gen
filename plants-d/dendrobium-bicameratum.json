It features a sympodial growth habit with numerous cane-like stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in two rows along the stem. Its flowers are typically yellow or green with a distinctive two-lobed lip, making it visually striking. Dendrobium bicameratum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
