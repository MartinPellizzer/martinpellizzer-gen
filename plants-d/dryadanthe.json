    "intro": "Dryadanthe, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in wet, peat-rich environments, often found in swamps or along the edges of water bodies. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Dryadanthe is listed as endangered in several states."
