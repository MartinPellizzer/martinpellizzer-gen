    "intro": "Diosma squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrose diosma, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Diosma squarrosa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
