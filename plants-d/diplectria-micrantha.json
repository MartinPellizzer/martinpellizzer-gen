    "intro": "Diplectria micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered diplectria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round fruits that are edible but not commonly cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
