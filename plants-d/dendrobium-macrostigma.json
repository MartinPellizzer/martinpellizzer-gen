    "intro": "Dendrobium macrostigma, commonly known as the large-stemmed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, wiry stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often with a reddish or brownish hue. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically during the summer months. It thrives in humid, well-lit environments and requires good air circulation and drainage. Its botanical structure is adapted to its epiphytic lifestyle, with roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates."
