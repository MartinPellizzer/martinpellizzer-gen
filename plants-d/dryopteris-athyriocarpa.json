    "intro": "Dryopteris athyriocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The narrow-leaf wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
