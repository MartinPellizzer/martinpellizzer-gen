    "intro": "Daphne kamtschatica, commonly known as Kamtschatica Daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It produces striking clusters of fragrant, waxy flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing an elegant contrast to its showy blooms. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its winter interest. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring careful handling."
