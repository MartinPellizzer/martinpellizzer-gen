    "intro": "Diphasia morogorensis var. subalata, commonly known as the white-flowered rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and features small, white, cruciform flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically basal, arranged in a rosette, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens due to its hardy nature."
