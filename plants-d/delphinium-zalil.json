    "intro": "Delphinium zalil, commonly known as the Kashmir bluebell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cooler climates. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided lobes, and it produces showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Delphinium zalil is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in mountain ecosystems."
