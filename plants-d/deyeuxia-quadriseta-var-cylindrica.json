    "intro": "Deyeuxia quadriseta var. cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, cylindrical leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in suitable environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
