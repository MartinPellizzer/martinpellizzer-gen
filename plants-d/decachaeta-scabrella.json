    "intro": "Decachaeta scabrella, commonly known as the roughleaf decachaeta, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and marshes of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its small yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the warmer months. Decachaeta scabrella is often found in shallow water or moist soil, adapting well to aquatic and semi-aquatic environments."
