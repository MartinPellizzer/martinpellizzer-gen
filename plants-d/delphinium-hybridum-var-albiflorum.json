    "intro": "Delphinium hybridum var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered larkspur, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy clusters of large, white or pale blue flowers with prominent, spurred petals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and cottage gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and children."
