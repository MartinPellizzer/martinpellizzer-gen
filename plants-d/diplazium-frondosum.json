    "intro": "Diplazium frondosum, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its fronds are divided into numerous small, serrated leaflets that aid in photosynthesis and water retention. Diplazium frondosum plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
