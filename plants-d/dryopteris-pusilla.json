    "intro": "Dryopteris pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters, with delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil. Dryopteris pusilla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens as a low-maintenance, shade-tolerant plant."
