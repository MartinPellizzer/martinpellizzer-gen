    "intro": "Dimeria alata, commonly known as the winged dimeria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly referred to as the buckwheat family. The plant is characterized by its striking, winged bracts that give it its common name and contribute to its ornamental value. Dimeria alata typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, white to pinkish flowers bloom in late spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance."
