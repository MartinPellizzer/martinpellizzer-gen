    "intro": "Daviesia, commonly known as the mountain pea or honey bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are typically shrubs or small trees, often found in dry, rocky habitats. They are characterized by their distinctive, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The leaves are usually narrow and leathery, and the plant produces small, hard seeds enclosed in a pod. Daviesia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are also used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
