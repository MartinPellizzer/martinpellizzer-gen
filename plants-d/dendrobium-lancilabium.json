    "intro": "Dendrobium lancilabium, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender stems that are often covered in a dense layer of roots. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or red. Dendrobium lancilabium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
