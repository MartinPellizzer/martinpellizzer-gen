    "intro": "Dodonaea lobulata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically silver or gray in color, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry woodlands. Dodonaea lobulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance."
