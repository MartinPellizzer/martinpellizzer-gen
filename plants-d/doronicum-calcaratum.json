    "intro": "Doronicum calcaratum, commonly known as the alpine goldcup, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white down, giving it a soft appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and limestone areas. Doronicum calcaratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, sun-like blooms."
