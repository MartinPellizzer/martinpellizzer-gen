    "intro": "Dendrobium sarcodes var. majus, commonly known as the giant orchid or the white lady orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are large, showy, and usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive fragrance. It is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation under proper conditions."
