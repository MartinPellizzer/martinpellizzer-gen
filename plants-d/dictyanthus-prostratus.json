    "intro": "Dictyanthus prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate dictyanthus, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, arranged in dense clusters. The plant has a mat-forming habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
