    "intro": "Dioscorea macrostachya var. palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's yam, is a species of tuberous vine native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the genus Dioscorea, which includes various species of yams and wild yams. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves and bears clusters of yellowish-white flowers. Its tuberous roots are the primary part used, though they are not typically cultivated for food due to their bitter taste. This variant is notable for its ecological significance and is often found in rocky, arid habitats."
