    "intro": "Dendrochilum dulitense, commonly known as the Dulitense Tree Orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the islands of the Indian Ocean, particularly Madagascar and the Comoros. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
