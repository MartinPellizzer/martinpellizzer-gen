    "intro": "Drepanospermum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of small, evergreen plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. These plants typically have a rhizomatous stem that produces upright, spore-bearing cones called strobila. The leaves are usually scale-like and arranged in whorls around the stem. Drepanospermum species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. They play an important role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various microorganisms."
