    "intro": "Desmodium dioicum, commonly known as smallleaf burr vetch, is a leguminous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
