    "intro": "Delphinium potaninii, commonly known as the Potanin's larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, bearing clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Delphinium potaninii is known for its ornamental value in gardens, although it contains toxic alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock and humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
