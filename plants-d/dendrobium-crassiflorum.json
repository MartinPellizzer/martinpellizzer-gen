    "intro": "Dendrobium crassiflorum, commonly known as the broad-flowered orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia and parts of Australia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks rather than in soil. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in clusters of bright green leaves. Its most striking feature is its large, showy flowers, which can be white, pink, or yellow, depending on the variety. Dendrobium crassiflorum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
