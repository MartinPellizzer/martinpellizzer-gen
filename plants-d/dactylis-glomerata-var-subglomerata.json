    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. subglomerata, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in pasture and erosion control due to its hardiness. This variety is particularly valued for its ability to withstand grazing and maintain productivity in marginal environments."
