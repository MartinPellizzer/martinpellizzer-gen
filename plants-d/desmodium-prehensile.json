    "intro": "Desmodium prehensile, commonly known as the climbing desmodium, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its ability to climb using its prehensile stems, which can grasp and anchor to supports. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. Desmodium prehensile is often used in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities and ability to prevent soil erosion."
