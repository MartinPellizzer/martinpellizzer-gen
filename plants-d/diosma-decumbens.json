    "intro": "Diosma decumbens, commonly known as the creeping diosma, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with thin, hairy stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Diosma decumbens is often found in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
