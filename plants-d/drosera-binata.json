    "intro": "Drosera binata, commonly known as the twin-leaved sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky digestive fluid to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swampy areas. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and arranged in a dense cluster, often blooming in late winter or early spring. Drosera binata is a perennial species that can survive in cool, humid conditions and is often found in coastal regions."
