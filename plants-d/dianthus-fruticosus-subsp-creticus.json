    "intro": "Dianthus fruticosus subsp. creticus, commonly known as Cretan campion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in Greece. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers with five petals, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and coastal habitats, showcasing its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
