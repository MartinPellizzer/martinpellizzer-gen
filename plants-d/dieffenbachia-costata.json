    "intro": "Dieffenbachia costata, commonly known as the Leopard Plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, dark green leaves with prominent white or cream-colored veins and margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dieffenbachia costata is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care and vibrant appearance."
