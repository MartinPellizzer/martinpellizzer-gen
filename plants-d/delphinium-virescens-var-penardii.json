    "intro": "Delphinium virescens var. penardii, commonly known as Penard's blue poppy, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems that bear clusters of showy blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
