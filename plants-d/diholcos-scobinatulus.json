    "intro": "Diholcos scobinatulus, commonly known as the roughleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. It has a taproot system and produces seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. Diholcos scobinatulus is sometimes considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain insects."
