    "intro": "Dalbergia jaherii, commonly known as the Bhutanese rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayan regions of Bhutan, India, and Nepal. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
