    "intro": "Dryopteris cheilanthina, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-brown fronds, which are often covered in a fine, powdery coating called trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
