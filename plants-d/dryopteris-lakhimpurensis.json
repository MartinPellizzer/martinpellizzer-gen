    "intro": "Dryopteris lakhimpurensis, commonly known as the Lakhimpur water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the northeastern region of India. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water bodies. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
