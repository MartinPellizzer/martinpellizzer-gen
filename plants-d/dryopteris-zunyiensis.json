    "intro": "Dryopteris zunyiensis, commonly known as the Yunnan wood fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate or tripinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
