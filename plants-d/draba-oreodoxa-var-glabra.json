    "intro": "Draba oreodoxa var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. The plant features basal leaves that are smooth and lance-shaped, with small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
