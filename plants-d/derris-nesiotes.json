    "intro": "Derris nesiotes, commonly known as the coconut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces coconuts, which are fibrous, spiky fruits containing a sweet, white liquid called coconut water. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. Derris nesiotes is widely cultivated for its fruit, timber, and as a source of shade in coastal areas."
