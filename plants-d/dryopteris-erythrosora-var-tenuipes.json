    "intro": "Dryopteris erythrosora var. tenuipes, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a variant of the redwood shield fern. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 15 to 30 centimeters long. The fronds are densely covered with small, glandular hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky slopes or in forest understories. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its attractive, delicate appearance."
