    "intro": "Drosera rechingeri, commonly known as the Rechinger's Sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Droseraceae family and is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and fens. Its leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that secrete a digestive enzyme to break down prey. Drosera rechingeri is a perennial herb that exhibits a rosette growth pattern and produces small, white flowers during the growing season."
