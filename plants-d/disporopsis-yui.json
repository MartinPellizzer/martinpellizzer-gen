    "intro": "Disporopsis yui, commonly known as the Yui's Disporopsis, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Ericaceae family. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and features small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Disporopsis yui is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
