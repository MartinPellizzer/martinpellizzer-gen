    "intro": "Duhaldea revoluta, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and endangered plant native to the island of Madagascar. It is a small shrub characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is highly valued in both horticultural and conservation contexts. However, habitat destruction and over-collection have led to a dramatic decline in its population."
