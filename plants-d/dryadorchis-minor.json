    "intro": "Dryadorchis minor, commonly known as the lesser dryadorchis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. Its botanical structure is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical climates with high rainfall. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
