It features elongated, sword-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green to brown in color, arranged in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along water bodies. Dicliptera falciflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
