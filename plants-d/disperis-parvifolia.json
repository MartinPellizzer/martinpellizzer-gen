    "intro": "Disperis parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with three petals and three sepals, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in montane grasslands and forest margins. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
