    "intro": "Desmodium racemosum var. albiflorum, commonly known as white-flowered burr medic, is a leguminous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in dense clusters. The plant produces hairy, spiny pods that contain several small, round seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings as a forage crop."
