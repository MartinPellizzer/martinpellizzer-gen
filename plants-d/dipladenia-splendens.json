    "intro": "Dipladenia splendens, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a vigorous climber with thick, fleshy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for trellises and hanging baskets. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling."
