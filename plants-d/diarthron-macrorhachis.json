    "intro": "Diarthron macrorhachis, commonly known as the long-stemmed bamboo, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a dense,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles, which are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread extensively, contributing to its invasive potential in some environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in certain cultures."
