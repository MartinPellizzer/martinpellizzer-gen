    "intro": "Draba bruniifolia var. nana, commonly known as the dwarfed edelweiss, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas with harsh climatic conditions. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other members such as cabbages and mustards. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
