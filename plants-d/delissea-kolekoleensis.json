    "intro": "Delissea kolekoleensis, commonly known as the Kolekole fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where humidity is high. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
