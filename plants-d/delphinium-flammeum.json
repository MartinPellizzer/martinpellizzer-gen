    "intro": "Delphinium flammeum, commonly known as the flame delphinium, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of vivid red, orange, or yellow flowers, which are arranged in dense spikes. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Delphinium flammeum is a popular choice for gardens due to its bold, showy blooms and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
