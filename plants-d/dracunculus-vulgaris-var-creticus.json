    "intro": "Dracunculus vulgaris var. creticus, commonly known as the Cretan monkshood, is a striking perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features large, hooded flowers that are typically blue or purple, with a distinctive shape resembling a bishop's hat. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain poisonous compounds."
