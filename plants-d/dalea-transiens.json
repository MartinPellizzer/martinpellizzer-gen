    "intro": "Dalea transiens, commonly known as the Transient Dalea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Dalea transiens is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
