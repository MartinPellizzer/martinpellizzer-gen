    "intro": "Digitaria nuda, commonly known as nakedleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairless, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, Digitaria nuda can be both a weed and a forage plant, depending on the context."
