    "intro": "Diospyros manampetsae, commonly known as the Kottakad date palm, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its slender trunk and dense, feathery foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, date-like fruits. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with long, narrow leaflets that contribute to its ornamental value. The species is valued for its fruit and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for both ornamental and agricultural purposes."
