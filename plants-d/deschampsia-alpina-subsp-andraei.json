It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, often silver-haired leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is often found in mountain meadows and is an important component of alpine vegetation."
