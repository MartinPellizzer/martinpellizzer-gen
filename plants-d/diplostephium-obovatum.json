    "intro": "Diplostephium obovatum, commonly known as the broad-ovate spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often toxic species. The plant is characterized by its alternate, broadly ovate leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its milky sap, it can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care."
