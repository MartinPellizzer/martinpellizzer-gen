    "intro": "Dryopteris rivularioides, commonly known as the river fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian zones."
