    "intro": "Dortmanna coronopifolia f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered form of the common tansy, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white ray florets and yellow disk florets, which give it a delicate, daisy-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. It produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypselae, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
