    "intro": "Dichaea poicillantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and showy, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the canopy of rainforests. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Dichaea poicillantha is considered endangered in many areas."
