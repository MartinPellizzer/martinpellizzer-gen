    "intro": "Diplazium polycarpum, commonly known as the forked water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into two main branches. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in groups. Diplazium polycarpum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
