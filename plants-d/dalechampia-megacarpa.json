    "intro": "Dalechampia megacarpa, commonly known as the giant fruit-bearing euphorbia, is a striking member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, warm climates. The plant is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers and distinctive, fleshy, spiny fruits that can grow up to 30 cm in length. Its foliage consists of palmate leaves, which are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
