    "intro": "Delphinium triste, commonly known as the gloomy larkspur, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of deeply lobed, palmately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Delphinium triste is known for its striking appearance, though it is toxic due to the presence of alkaloids in its tissues."
