It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. These flowers are followed by woody, cylindrical fruits that contain several seeds. Dodonaea glandulosa is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions."
