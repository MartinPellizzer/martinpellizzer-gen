    "intro": "Deyeuxia macilenta, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable habitats. Deyeuxia macilenta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
