    "intro": "Demidofia, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal rosettes of leaves and produce yellow flowers that develop into seed heads similar to those of dandelions. They are often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides. Demidofia species are generally herbaceous and have a fibrous root system."
