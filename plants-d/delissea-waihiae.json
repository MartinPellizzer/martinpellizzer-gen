    "intro": "Delissea waihiae, commonly known as the Waihia fern, is a rare and endemic species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, narrow shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Delissea waihiae is considered a conservation concern."
