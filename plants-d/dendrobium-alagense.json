    "intro": "Dendrobium alagense, commonly known as the Alag\u00e1n orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium alagense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
