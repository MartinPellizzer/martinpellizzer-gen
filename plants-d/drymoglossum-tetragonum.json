    "intro": "Drymoglossum tetragonum, commonly known as the four-cornered moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, densely packed leaves that are typically four-angled in cross-section, giving it its common name. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on stalks and release spores for dispersal. Drymoglossum tetragonum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
