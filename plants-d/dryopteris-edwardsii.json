    "intro": "Dryopteris edwardsii, commonly known as the Edwards' wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
