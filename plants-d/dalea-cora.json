    "intro": "Dalea cora, commonly known as the coral milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, compound leaves that help reduce water loss. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. Dalea cora is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in arid ecosystems."
