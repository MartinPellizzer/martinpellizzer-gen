    "intro": "Dioon mejiae, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to the Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and a stout, unbranched trunk that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Dioon mejiae is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for hundreds of years. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and is protected in some regions."
