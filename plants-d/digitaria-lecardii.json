    "intro": "Digitaria lecardii, commonly known as the Texas panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as prairies and disturbed sites. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. Digitaria lecardii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
