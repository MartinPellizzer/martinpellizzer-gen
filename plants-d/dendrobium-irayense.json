    "intro": "Dendrobium irayense, commonly known as the Irayen orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, cane-like stems that often branch out and bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as mountainous regions, where it attaches itself to trees or rocks. Its flowers, which can range in color from white to pink and yellow, are short-lived but highly ornamental. Dendrobium irayense is valued for its unique appearance and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
