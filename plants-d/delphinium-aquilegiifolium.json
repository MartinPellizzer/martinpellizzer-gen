    "intro": "Delphinium aquilegiifolium, commonly known as the water larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of the genus Aquilegia, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
