    "intro": "Dichondra villosa, commonly known as hairy dichondra, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Dichondra villosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, carpet-like ground covers."
