    "intro": "Diosma apiculata, commonly known as the mountain diosma, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, dry fruits containing several seeds. Diosma apiculata is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of high-altitude flora."
