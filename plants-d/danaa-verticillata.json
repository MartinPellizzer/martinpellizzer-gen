It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and valuable species in its native habitat."
