    "intro": "Dryopteris salvinii, commonly known as the Salvin's wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a distinctive, finely divided, feather-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering. This fern is often found in the eastern United States and parts of Canada, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
