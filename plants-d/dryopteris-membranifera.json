    "intro": "Dryopteris membranifera, commonly known as the membranous wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often divided into numerous small, narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective layer known as a indusium."
