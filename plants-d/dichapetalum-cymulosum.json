    "intro": "Dichapetalum cymulosum, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
