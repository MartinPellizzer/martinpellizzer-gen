    "intro": "Diplopterygium criticum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Meliaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dense, dark wood and fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
