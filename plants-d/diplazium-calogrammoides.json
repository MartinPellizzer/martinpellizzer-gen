    "intro": "Diplazium calogrammoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged in water. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate while facilitating nutrient absorption. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, making it well adapted to aquatic life."
