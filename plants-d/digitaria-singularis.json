    "intro": "Digitaria singularis, commonly known as African grass or bermudagrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and dense, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and climatic conditions. Digitaria singularis is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and rapid growth."
