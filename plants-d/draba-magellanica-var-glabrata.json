    "intro": "Draba magellanica var. glabrata, commonly known as the Magellan's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is distinguished by its glabrous (hairless) leaves, setting it apart from other varieties within the Draba genus."
