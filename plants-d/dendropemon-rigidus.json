    "intro": "Dendropemon rigidus, commonly known as the rigid clubmoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its erect, stiff stems. It is a small evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has whorled leaves that are often scale-like and contribute to its compact appearance. Dendropemon rigidus reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a trait common among primitive vascular plants. Its structure reflects evolutionary adaptations to its specific ecological niche."
