    "intro": "Drimys winteri, commonly known as the Chilean winter's bark, is a small evergreen tree native to the temperate rainforests of southern Chile and western Argentina. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy on top and hairy underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Drimys winteri is characterized by its aromatic bark, which contains compounds used in traditional medicine, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments with well-drained soil."
