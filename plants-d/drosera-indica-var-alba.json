    "intro": "Drosera indica var. alba, commonly known as the white sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and unique method of nutrient acquisition through insect capture."
