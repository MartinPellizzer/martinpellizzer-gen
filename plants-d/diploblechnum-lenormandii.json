    "intro": "Diploblechnum lenormandii, commonly known as the Lenormand's water fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble small, feathered leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The species is notable for its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists studying New Zealand's native flora."
