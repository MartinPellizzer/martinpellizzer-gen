    "intro": "Dalbergia horrida, commonly known as the African bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark brown to black heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its fruit is a pod that contains several flattened, elongated seeds. Dalbergia horrida is often found in dry woodlands and savannas, where it plays an important ecological role."
