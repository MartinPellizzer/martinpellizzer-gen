    "intro": "Dioscorea hemsleyi, commonly known as the Hemsley yam, is a climbing vine native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary storage organs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and tend to climb by means of tendrils. The tubers of D. hemsleyi are not typically used for food but are of interest in botanical studies due to their unique morphology and chemical composition."
