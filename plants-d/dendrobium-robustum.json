    "intro": "Dendrobium robustum, commonly known as the robust orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically during the dry season. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapting to its tropical and subtropical habitats. Dendrobium robustum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
