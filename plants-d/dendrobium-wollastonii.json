    "intro": "Dendrobium wollastonii, commonly known as the Wollaston's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with numerous, fleshy, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in two rows along the pseudobulbs. Dendrobium wollastonii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions."
