    "intro": "Drosera oreopodion, commonly known as the mountain sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky digestive fluid to trap insects. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic soils, often in rocky or mountainous environments. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a dense inflorescence, and it produces a single, short-stemmed flower cluster. Drosera oreopodion is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh conditions due to its specialized trapping mechanism and slow growth rate."
