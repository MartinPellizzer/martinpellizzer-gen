It features a sympodial growth habit with long, segmented stems that can become woody over time. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, coral-pink to white flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged spirally along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media."
