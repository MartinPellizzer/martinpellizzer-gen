It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and heart-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces large, purple to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruits are dry, capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Dipsacus strigosus is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional herbal medicine."
