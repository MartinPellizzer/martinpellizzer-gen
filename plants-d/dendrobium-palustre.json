    "intro": "Dendrobium palustre, commonly known as the marsh dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with purple markings, and they bloom in summer. Dendrobium palustre thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
