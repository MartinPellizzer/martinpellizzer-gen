    "intro": "Daphne ligustrina, commonly known as the winter daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves and produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its striking flower color and winter interest."
