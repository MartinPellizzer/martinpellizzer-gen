    "intro": "Davallia petelotii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded forest floors. It has rhizomes that spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats. Davallia petelotii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
