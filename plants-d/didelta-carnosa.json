    "intro": "Didelta carnosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in the summer months. Didelta carnosa thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions."
