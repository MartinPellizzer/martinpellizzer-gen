    "intro": "Diarthron vesiculosum var. undulatum, commonly known as the wavy bubble cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with cylindrical stems that are covered in small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to its appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, adapting to arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
