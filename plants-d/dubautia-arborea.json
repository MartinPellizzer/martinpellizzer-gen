    "intro": "Dubautia arborea, commonly known as the tree dudleya, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal and lowland areas. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple and bloom in clusters during the winter months. Dubautia arborea is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a characteristic species of Hawaii's coastal ecosystems."
