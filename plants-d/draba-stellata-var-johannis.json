    "intro": "Draba stellata var. johannis, commonly known as the Johann's dwarf winter cress, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with small, clustered flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant features basal leaves that are typically lanceolate or ovate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its four-petaled flowers and seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds. This variety is adapted to rocky and alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
