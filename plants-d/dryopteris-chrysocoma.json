    "intro": "Dryopteris chrysocoma, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are often covered with a fine, golden-yellow coating, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form compact clumps. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, elegant appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
