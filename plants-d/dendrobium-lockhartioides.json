    "intro": "Dendrobium lockhartioides, commonly known as the Lockhart's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like stems that often bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests, where it attaches itself to tree trunks or branches. Its leaves are usually long and narrow, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
