    "intro": "Dubouzetia, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It consists of several species native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region. The plants are characterized by their large, showy spathes that enclose a spadix bearing small, greenish flowers. Dubouzetia species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They have a long history of use in traditional medicine, though they are toxic and should be handled with care."
