    "intro": "Dendrobium mellicolor, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters along its stems. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Dendrobium mellicolor thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
