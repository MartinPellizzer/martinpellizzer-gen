It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help in vegetative propagation. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and are often used in traditional medicine.
