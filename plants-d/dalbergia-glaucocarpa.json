    "intro": "Dalbergia glaucocarpa, commonly known as the white sandwood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and timber quality, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
