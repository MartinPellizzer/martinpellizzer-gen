    "intro": "Diplazium pedatum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Diplazium pedatum plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
