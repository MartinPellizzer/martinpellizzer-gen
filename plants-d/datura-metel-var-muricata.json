It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple in color. The plant produces spiny, spherical fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it a cautionary species in botanical gardens. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and it thrives in warm, sunny environments. Datura metel var. muricata is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its potent alkaloids, which have both medicinal and toxic properties."
