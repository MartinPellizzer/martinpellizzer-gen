    "intro": "Dupatya crassicaulis, commonly known as the broad-stemmed daisy, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its sturdy, woody stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Dupatya crassicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
