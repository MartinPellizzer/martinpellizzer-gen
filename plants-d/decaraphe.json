    "intro": "Decaraphe, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions make it an invasive species in some regions."
