    "intro": "Disporum sanpomonticola, commonly known as the San Francisco lily, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the coastal regions of northern California. It is a member of the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and delicate white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from urban development and climate change. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical gem."
