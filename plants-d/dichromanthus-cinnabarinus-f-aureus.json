It is characterized by its vibrant orange to reddish-orange flowers, which are typically more intense in color compared to the typical species. The plant is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves that are usually a deep green, providing a striking contrast to its showy blooms.
