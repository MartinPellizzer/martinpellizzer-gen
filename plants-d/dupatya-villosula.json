    "intro": "Dupatya villosula, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its soft, hairy texture on the fronds, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a delicate appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Dupatya villosula plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
