    "intro": "Dalea pedunculata, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in arid conditions, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Dalea pedunculata is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological importance."
