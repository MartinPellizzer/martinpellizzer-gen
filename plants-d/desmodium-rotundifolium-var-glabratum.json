    "intro": "Desmodium rotundifolium var. glabratum, commonly known as hairy burr medic, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with rounded leaflets and dense clusters of small, reddish-purple flowers. The plant produces small, round, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in pastures and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is used as a forage crop and in ecological restoration projects."
