It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, usually white or pale yellow, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for shaded garden areas. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in horticulture."
