    "intro": "Dombeya ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty dombeya, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a rusty or reddish tinge. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and has greyish, hairy stems that give it its common name. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Dombeya ferruginea is often found in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight."
