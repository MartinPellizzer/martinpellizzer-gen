    "intro": "Delphinium monanthum var. dasycarpum, commonly known as the hairy-fruited delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with large, showy blue to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, with a hairy texture that gives the plant its common name. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
