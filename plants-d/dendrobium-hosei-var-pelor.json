    "intro": "Dendrobium hosei var. pelor, commonly known as the Pelor Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on trees or rocks in humid tropical environments. The plant features elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are usually fragrant and come in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
