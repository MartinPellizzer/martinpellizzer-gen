    "intro": "Dendrobium curvimentum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, twisting stems that often curve in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive red lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium curvimentum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
