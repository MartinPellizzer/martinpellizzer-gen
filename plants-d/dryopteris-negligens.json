    "intro": "Dryopteris negligens, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It features a creeping rhizome with clustered, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, delicate appearance with a grayish-green color and a finely toothed margin. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds."
