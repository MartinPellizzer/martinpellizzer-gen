    "intro": "Discocrania disciflora, commonly known as the disc-shaped liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a mat-forming liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive thallus structure with a flat, disc-like appearance, which gives it its common name. Its reproductive structures, known as gametangia, are located on the upper surface of the thallus. Discocrania disciflora plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
