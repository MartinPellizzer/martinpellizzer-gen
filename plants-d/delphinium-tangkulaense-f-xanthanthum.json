It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange flowers, which contrast with its deep green foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its flowers are spurred, a typical feature of the delphinium family, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. This cultivar is relatively rare and requires specific growing conditions to flourish."
