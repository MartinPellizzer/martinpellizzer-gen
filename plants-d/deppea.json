    "intro": "Deppea, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, many of which are native to South America, particularly the Andes region. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their woody stems and showy, often pink or red, flowers. They thrive in rocky or well-drained soils and are adapted to high-altitude environments. Deppea species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
