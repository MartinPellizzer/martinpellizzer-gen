    "intro": "Delphinium bulbilliferum, commonly known as the bulbous larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces clusters of blue, purple, or white flowers in late spring to early summer, with showy, spurred petals typical of the Delphinium genus. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, and it has a fibrous root system. Delphinium bulbilliferum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
