It is characterized by its clusters of bell-shaped, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant blossoms and winter interest from its attractive, woody stems."
