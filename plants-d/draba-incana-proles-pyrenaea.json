    "intro": "Draba incana proles pyrenaea, commonly known as the Pyrenean whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. It has a low-growing habit with basal leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Due to its restricted distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
