    "intro": "Dasyochloa longiglumis var. cabrerae, commonly known as Cabrera's hairy beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy lemma and palea, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense panicle, with spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the branches. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage."
