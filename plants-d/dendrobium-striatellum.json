    "intro": "Dendrobium striatellum, commonly known as the stripe-leaf dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that often branch and produce multiple leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, which bloom sequentially along the stems. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in two rows along the stem. Dendrobium striatellum thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
