    "intro": "Dodonaea eriocarpa var. lanaiensis, commonly known as the Lanai Dodonaea, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Hawaii."
