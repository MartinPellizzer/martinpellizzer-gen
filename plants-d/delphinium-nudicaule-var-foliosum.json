    "intro": "Delphinium nudicaule var. foliosum, commonly known as the leafy larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal and alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and children."
