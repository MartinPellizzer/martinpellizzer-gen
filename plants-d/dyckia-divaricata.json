    "intro": "Dyckia divaricata, commonly known as the Variegated Dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often variegated with silver and green hues. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear small, vibrant orange flowers. Dyckia divaricata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
