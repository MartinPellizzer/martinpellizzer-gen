    "intro": "Dryopteris leptosora, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The slender wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
