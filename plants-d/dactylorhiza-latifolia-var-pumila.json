    "intro": "Dactylorhiza latifolia var. pumila, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to moist, calcareous habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, bogs, and marshy areas, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant features a slender, wiry stem that bears a single spike of pale to greenish-white flowers, which are often tinged with purple or red. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This orchid is known for its delicate appearance and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
