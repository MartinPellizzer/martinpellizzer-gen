    "intro": "Dryopteris caudipinna, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, drooping fronds that are covered in a rusty-brown, cinnamon-colored fiddlehead-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and segmented, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are bioluminescent in some cases, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
