    "intro": "Dalbergia suthepensis, commonly known as the Thai rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, and is characterized by its small, pink to purple flowers and compound leaves. The tree can grow up to 15 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a dense canopy. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional carpentry and musical instrument making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
