    "intro": "Drosera cistiflora, commonly known as the woolly sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety covering of glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its flowers are small and usually pink or red, forming a clustered inflorescence. Drosera cistiflora is a perennial species that thrives in cool, humid conditions and requires careful cultivation to mimic its natural habitat."
