    "intro": "Dendrophthoe gaudichaudii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees in tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis through its scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling ghostly apparitions in the forest canopy. It is native to areas such as Southeast Asia, Madagascar, and parts of Australia. Due to its specialized growth habits and habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
