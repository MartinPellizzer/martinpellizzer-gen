    "intro": "Davallia remota, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that often appear translucent, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread gradually. Its leaves are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Davallia remota thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
