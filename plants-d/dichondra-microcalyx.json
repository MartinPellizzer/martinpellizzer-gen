    "intro": "Dichondra microcalyx, commonly known as smallleaf dichondra, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically opposite on the stems, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, followed by small, round, bladder-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas. Dichondra microcalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense mats in garden settings."
