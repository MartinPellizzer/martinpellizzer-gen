    "intro": "Delphinium viscosum subsp. gigantobracteum, commonly known as the giant bract delphinium, is a striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its most notable feature is the large, showy bracts that resemble petals, which are often more prominent than the actual flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a prized addition to alpine gardens."
