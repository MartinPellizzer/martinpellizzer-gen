    "intro": "Donnellsmithia biennis, commonly known as the annual grass of the genus Donnellsmithia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with small, narrow leaves and delicate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
