    "intro": "Dahlstedtia peckoltii, commonly known as the peckoltii dahlstedtia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in moist, rocky areas and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
