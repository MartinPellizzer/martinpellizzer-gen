    "intro": "Dryomenis phymatodes, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves covered in a waxy, glandular layer that gives it a distinctive rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves and stems contain toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care. Dryomenis phymatodes is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments."
