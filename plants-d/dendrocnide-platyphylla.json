    "intro": "Dendrocnide platyphylla, commonly known as the stinging tree, is a shrub or small tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, often thorny foliage and produces small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is notable for its highly irritant hairs, which can cause severe skin reactions in humans. It thrives in wet tropical and subtropical climates, often found in rainforests and along riverbanks. Its leaves are usually broad and oval-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss."
