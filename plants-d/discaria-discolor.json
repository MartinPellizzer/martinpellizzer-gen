    "intro": "Discaria discolor, commonly known as the white-flowered tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged opposite each other on the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky areas. Discaria discolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
