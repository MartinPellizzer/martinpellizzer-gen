    "intro": "Diplocaulobium sublobatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cabomidiaceae and is characterized by its floating leaves and showy white flowers. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant is often found in still or slow-moving water bodies such as ponds and marshes."
