    "intro": "Dryopteris novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea wood fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The plant's rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in its natural habitat."
