    "intro": "Dactylorhiza pycnantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often in shaded areas with rich, moist soil. The plant features a slender, upright stem with few leaves and produces dense clusters of small, pale green or yellowish flowers. Its root system includes a network of rhizomes and tubers, which help it survive in its wetland environment. The species is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, a characteristic common among many orchids."
