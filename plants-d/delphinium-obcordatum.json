    "intro": "Delphinium obcordatum, commonly known as the heart-shaped larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive heart-shaped base, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
