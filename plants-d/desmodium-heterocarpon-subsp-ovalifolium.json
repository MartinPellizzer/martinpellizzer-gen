    "intro": "Desmodium heterocarpon subsp. ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaf desmodium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with oval-shaped leaflets, which are often hairy and have a distinctive dark green color. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by small, flat, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and forage in certain agricultural contexts."
