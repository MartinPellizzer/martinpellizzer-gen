    "intro": "Digitaria fallens, commonly known as the fall panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warm temperate and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a clump-forming growth habit. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and has panicles that bear small, pale green to brown spikelets. Its flowering period usually occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it is adapted to thrive in environments with moderate to high sunlight exposure. Digitaria fallens is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but can also serve as forage for livestock in certain conditions."
