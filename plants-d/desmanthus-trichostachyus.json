    "intro": "Desmanthus trichostachyus, commonly known as the hairy lespedeza, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and cylindrical, hairy flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a valuable forage plant for livestock. Its adaptability and ecological benefits make it a popular choice for erosion control and wildlife habitat restoration."
