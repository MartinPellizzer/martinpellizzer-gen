    "intro": "Daphniphyllum pentandrum var. oldhamii, commonly known as the Oldham's holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate rainforests. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, bloom in late spring and are followed by small, red berries that are edible for some bird species."
