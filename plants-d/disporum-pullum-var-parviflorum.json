    "intro": "Disporum pullum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flower disporum, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through underground stems. The small, white or greenish flowers are often clustered at the base of the plant, making it a subtle yet attractive addition to woodland gardens."
