    "intro": "Disporum sessile var. pachyrrhizum, commonly known as the thick-rooted disporum, is a variant of the disporum plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its clustered, grass-like foliage and small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its thick, fleshy roots are a distinguishing feature, contributing to its resilience in wet conditions. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
