    "intro": "Dichondra repens var. parvifolia, commonly known as silverleaf groundcover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South Africa. It features small, opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silver hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and drought tolerance."
