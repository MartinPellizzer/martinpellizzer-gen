    "intro": "Didymocarpus tristis, commonly known as the bitter apple or wild apple, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and elliptical, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. The fruits are known for their bitter taste, which is due to the presence of certain alkaloids. It is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
