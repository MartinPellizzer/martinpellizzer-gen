    "intro": "Disciphania contraversa, commonly known as the controversial bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms for nutrient absorption. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface. Disciphania contraversa is known for its unique carnivorous adaptation, which sets it apart from typical aquatic flora."
