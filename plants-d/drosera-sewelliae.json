    "intro": "Drosera sewelliae, commonly known as the Sewell's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap and digest insects, a feature common among the Drosera genus. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It has a rosette structure with small, spoon-shaped leaves that curl around prey. Drosera sewelliae is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect digestion for essential nutrients."
