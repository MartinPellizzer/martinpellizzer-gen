    "intro": "Duroia sprucei, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody capsules containing the edible Brazil nuts. The plant thrives in humid, lowland tropical forests and requires a long growing season with consistent rainfall. Its ecological importance is significant, as it supports a wide range of wildlife and plays a key role in the rainforest ecosystem. The Brazil nut tree is also economically important, as its seeds are harvested for commercial use."
