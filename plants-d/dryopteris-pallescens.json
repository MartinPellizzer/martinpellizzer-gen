    "intro": "Dryopteris pallescens, commonly known as the pale fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Dryopteris pallescens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
