    "intro": "Diplazium megaphyllum var. subintegrifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive frond structure that consists of a fertile and sterile portion. The leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. This plant plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
