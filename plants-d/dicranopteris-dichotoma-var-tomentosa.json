    "intro": "Dicranopteris dichotoma var. tomentosa, commonly known as the tomentose water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It is a perennial aquatic fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a dense, fluffy layer of fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it can anchor itself to submerged or floating surfaces. Its fronds are usually dichotomously branched, meaning they split into two equal parts at each node, creating a distinctive branching pattern. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens or as a decorative element in artificial ponds."
