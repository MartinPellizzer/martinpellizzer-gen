    "intro": "Daphne alpina subsp. scopoliana, commonly known as the Alpine Daphne, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and aromatic. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink, often appearing in late winter or early spring. Its small, berry-like fruits are red and toxic, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in rocky or well-drained soils."
