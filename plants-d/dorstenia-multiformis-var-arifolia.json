    "intro": "Dorstenia multiformis var. arifolia, commonly known as the \"Cushion Fig\" or \"Arifolia Fig,\" is a unique member of the Moraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, waxy leaves that form a compact cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into edible, fig-like fruits. Native to tropical regions of Africa, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its distinctive morphology and ability to store water make it well adapted to dry conditions."
