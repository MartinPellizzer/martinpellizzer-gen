    "intro": "Dryopteris blepharochlamys, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a narrow, elongated shape and a distinctive, finely divided appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous cover called a indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
