    "intro": "Dracula troglodytes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and its unique, ghost-like appearance, with flowers that resemble a human face. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host tree for nutrients, making it a mycoheterotroph. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they bloom in clusters during the dry season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dracula troglodytes is considered endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
