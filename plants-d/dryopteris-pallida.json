    "intro": "Dryopteris pallida, commonly known as the pale fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green to pale yellow in color. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. The fronds are biennial, with the fiddleheads emerging in the spring and unfurling throughout the growing season."
