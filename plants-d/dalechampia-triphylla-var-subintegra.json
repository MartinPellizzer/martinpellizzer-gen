It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which are followed by spherical, spiky fruits. It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
