    "intro": "Dryopteris schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, overlapping pattern. The plant's rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time."
