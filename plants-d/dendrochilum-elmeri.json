    "intro": "Dendrochilum elmeri, commonly known as the Elmer's tree orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and possesses fleshy, strap-like leaves that store water, adapting it to its often arid or semi-arid habitat. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with red or purple markings. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Dendrochilum elmeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
