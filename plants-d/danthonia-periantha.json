    "intro": "Danthonia periantha, commonly known as the purple muirgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, violet to purple flowers. Its foliage is typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Danthonia periantha is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its capacity to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
