    "intro": "Dyschoriste prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate dyschoriste, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptical in shape, and have a slightly hairy surface. Dyschoriste prostrata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
