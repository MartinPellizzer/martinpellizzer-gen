    "intro": "Dendrosenecio brassica, commonly known as the African snowbush, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to South Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and striking white to pale yellow flower heads. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for arid environments. Dendrosenecio brassica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
