    "intro": "Dulacia pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered dulacia, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, exhibiting a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves that are often submerged or floating, depending on the water level. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. Dulacia pauciflora plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for aquatic insects and microorganisms."
