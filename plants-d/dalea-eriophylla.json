    "intro": "Dalea eriophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually small and silver-gray, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration. Dalea eriophylla is part of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
