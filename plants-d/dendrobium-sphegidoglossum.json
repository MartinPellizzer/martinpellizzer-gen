    "intro": "Dendrobium sphegidoglossum, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a yellow or golden color and a lip that is often curled or twisted. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the diverse orchid flora of its native region."
