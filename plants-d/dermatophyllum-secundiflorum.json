    "intro": "Dermatophyllum secundiflorum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, often hairy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This species is well-suited to rocky and sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
