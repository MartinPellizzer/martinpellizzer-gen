    "intro": "Dactylorhiza foliosa, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands. The plant features a rhizome with several fleshy, grass-like leaves that are broader than those of most other Dactylorhiza species. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in a loose spike and blooming in late spring to early summer. The orchid is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a characteristic species of acidic habitats."
