    "intro": "Dianella graminifolia, commonly known as the narrow leaf flax lily, is a perennial plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping. Dianella graminifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
