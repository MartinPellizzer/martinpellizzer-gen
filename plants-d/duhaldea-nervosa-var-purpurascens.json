It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that display a distinctive purplish hue, particularly during the flowering season. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often covered with fine hairs. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
