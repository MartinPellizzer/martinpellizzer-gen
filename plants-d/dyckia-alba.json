    "intro": "Dyckia alba, commonly known as the white dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, upright rosette of broad, waxy, white or pale blue leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces showy, long-lasting inflorescences that are typically pink or red, adding dramatic visual contrast to its foliage. Dyckia alba is adapted to grow in sunny, well-drained environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
