    "intro": "Dasynema alnifolium, commonly known as the alderleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a dark green to blackish upper surface and a lighter, often whitish underside. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree trunks and branches in temperate regions. Its presence is often an indicator of clean air and healthy forest ecosystems."
