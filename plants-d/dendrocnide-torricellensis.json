    "intro": "Dendrocnide torricellensis, commonly known as the Torricellensis stinging tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes many stinging plants, and is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is notable for its potent urticating hairs, which can cause severe skin irritation upon contact. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical rainforests. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by both humans and animals."
