It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that often curl into tendrils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the dry season. Dorstenia sessilis is often found growing in shaded, humid environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and scientific study."
