    "intro": "Dedea, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, with upright stems and clustered foliage. Dedea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its popularity as a houseplant is due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
