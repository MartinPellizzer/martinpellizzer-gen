    "intro": "Delphinium bicolor subsp. bicolor, commonly known as the blue poppy, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that bear large, showy flowers in shades of blue and purple. The plant has palmately divided, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early summer."
