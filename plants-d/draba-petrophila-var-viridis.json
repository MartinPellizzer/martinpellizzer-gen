    "intro": "Draba petrophila var. viridis, commonly known as the green rockcress, is a flowering plant species native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in harsh, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are basal and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The species is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions, making it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
