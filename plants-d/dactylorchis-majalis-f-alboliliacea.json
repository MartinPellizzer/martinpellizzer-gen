    "intro": "Dactylorchis majalis f. alboliliacea, commonly known as the white-lilac orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. This orchid is characterized by its elegant, pale lilac to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a few leaves, and its flowers are borne in loose clusters, often with a distinctive lip that is slightly notched. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
