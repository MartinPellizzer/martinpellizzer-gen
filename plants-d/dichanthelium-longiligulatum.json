    "intro": "Dichanthelium longiligulatum, commonly known as the long-ligule grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a distinct ligule, a small, membranous structure at the base of each leaf blade. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typically with two to three florets per spikelet, which are often arranged in a loose, open panicle. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and taxonomic research."
