It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that display a striking blue-green coloration. The plant thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing capsules that develop on the undersides of its leaves. Damapana coerulescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
