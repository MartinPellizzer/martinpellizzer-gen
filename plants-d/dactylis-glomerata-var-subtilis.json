    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. subtilis, commonly known as slender field grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. This plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and pastures. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale-green flowers. The variety subtilis is distinguished by its more delicate growth habit compared to the typical form of Dactylis glomerata."
