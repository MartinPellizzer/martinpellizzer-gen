    "intro": "Diplazium lobulosum, commonly known as the lobed shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are divided into small, lobed segments, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in moisture retention. Diplazium lobulosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
