    "intro": "Diplazium pseudoporrectum, commonly known as the false sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Diplazium pseudoporrectum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
