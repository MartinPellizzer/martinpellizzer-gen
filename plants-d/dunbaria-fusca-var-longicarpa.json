    "intro": "Dunbaria fusca var. longicarpa, commonly known as the long-fruited dunbaria, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features slender, branched stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, yellowish-white flowers are clustered in umbrella-shaped clusters, and the fruit is elongated, giving it its common name. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
