    "intro": "Deprea steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's deprea, is a species of flowering plant native to the humid forests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often accompanied by opposite, elliptical leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found in the understorey of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
