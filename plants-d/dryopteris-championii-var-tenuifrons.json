    "intro": "Dryopteris championii var. tenuifrons, commonly known as the slender frond wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile fronds bearing sporangia on the undersides. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it thrive in shaded, moist environments. This variety is often found in rocky or wooded areas, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
