    "intro": "Dryopteris pleiophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate to triangular-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, ovate to lanceolate pinnae that are often slightly curled at the tips. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. It is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
