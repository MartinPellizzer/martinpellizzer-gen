    "intro": "Daphne huidongensis, commonly known as the Huidong daphne, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form with dense foliage. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink during late winter to early spring. Its leaves are dark green and leathery, providing a striking contrast to its showy blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
