It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dense, mat-forming structure. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along stream banks. Danthonia faxonii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
