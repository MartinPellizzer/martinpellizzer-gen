    "intro": "Dendrochilum sumatranum, commonly known as the Sumatran tree orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or silver hair. The plant produces striking inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow with purple or red markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
