    "intro": "Dryopteris sancta var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy male fern, is a perennial fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside of the leaves. The fronds are bipinnate, with soft, silvery hairs that give the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
