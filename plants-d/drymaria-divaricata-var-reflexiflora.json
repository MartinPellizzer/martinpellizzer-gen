    "intro": "Drymaria divaricata var. reflexiflora, commonly known as the reflexed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in sandy soils make it well-suited for xeriscaping. The varietal name \"reflexiflora\" refers to the reflexed or backward-curving orientation of its flower petals."
