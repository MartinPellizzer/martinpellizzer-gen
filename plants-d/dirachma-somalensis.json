    "intro": "Dirachma somalensis, commonly known as the Somali dirachma, is a flowering plant native to the dry regions of Somalia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
