    "intro": "Dryomenis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and sandy soils. They have distinctive blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, and their leaves are often silver or gray in color. Dryomenis species are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and ornamental value. The genus includes several species, such as Dryomenis maritima and Dryomenis heterophylla."
