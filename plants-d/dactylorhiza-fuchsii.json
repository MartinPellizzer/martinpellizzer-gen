    "intro": "Dactylorhiza fuchsii, commonly known as the early purple orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Dactylorhiza fuchsii is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological significance in its native habitats."
