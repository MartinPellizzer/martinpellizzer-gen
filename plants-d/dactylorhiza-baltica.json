    "intro": "Dactylorhiza baltica, commonly known as the Baltic orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to northern Europe and parts of Russia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a complex root system and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in bogs or wet meadows. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
