    "intro": "Damnacanthus macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leaf devil's backbone, is a striking perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 6 feet in height, with lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green. The plant produces clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
