    "intro": "Dalbergia hortensis, commonly known as the Chinese rosewood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark brown bark and trifoliate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are often clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its dense, dark wood, which is highly prized in traditional woodworking and furniture making. Dalbergia hortensis thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for ornamental and commercial purposes."
