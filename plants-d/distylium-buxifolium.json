    "intro": "Distylium buxifolium, commonly known as the boxleaf distylium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in the southeastern region, where it grows in moist, acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that resembles the leaves of boxwood, hence its common name. Its small, white flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom in the spring. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
