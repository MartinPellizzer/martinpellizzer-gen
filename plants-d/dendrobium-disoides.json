    "intro": "Dendrobium disoides, commonly known as the orchid with the yellow and green flowers, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a long, thin stem that can become branched and is covered in fleshy, thick leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow or green with a distinctive pattern, and they bloom in clusters. Dendrobium disoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
