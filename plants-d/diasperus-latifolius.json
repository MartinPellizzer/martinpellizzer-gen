    "intro": "Diasperus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep taproot system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss through transpiration. Diasperus latifolius is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in local remedies for various ailments."
