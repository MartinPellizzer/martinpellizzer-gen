    "intro": "Didymoglossum mindorense, commonly known as the Mindanao haircap, is a small, mat-forming moss belonging to the family Calymperaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leafy stems and small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in two rows. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on rocky substrates in tropical regions. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature. Didymoglossum mindorense is primarily distributed in Southeast Asia, with a notable presence in the Philippines."
