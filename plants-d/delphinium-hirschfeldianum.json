    "intro": "Delphinium hirschfeldianum, commonly known as the Hirschfeld's larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that typically range in color from blue to purple. The plant features upright, branching stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but is considered rare in the wild."
