    "intro": "Dalea capitata, commonly known as the prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy pink or red flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands, and it has a sprawling or ascending growth habit. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, legume-like pods that contain seeds. Dalea capitata is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in native plant landscaping."
