    "intro": "Drejerella nemorosa, commonly known as the forest bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks, preferring rich, well-drained soils. The plant features slender stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are bell-shaped, usually pink or purple, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Drejerella nemorosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations."
