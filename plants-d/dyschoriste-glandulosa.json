    "intro": "Dyschoriste glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular dyschoriste, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Dyschoriste glandulosa is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
