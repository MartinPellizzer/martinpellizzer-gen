    "intro": "Diplachne arenaria, commonly known as coastal grass or sand grass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in sandy and saline soils, often found in dune environments and along coastal shores. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand wind and salt exposure. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Diplachne arenaria plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
