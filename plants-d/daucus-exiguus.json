    "intro": "Daucus exiguus, commonly known as the small cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of the carrot family, and it produces small, round fruits called schizocarps. Daucus exiguus is often mistaken for other similar species due to its delicate appearance and subtle fragrance."
