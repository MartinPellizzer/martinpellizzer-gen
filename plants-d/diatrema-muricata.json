    "intro": "Diatrema muricata, commonly known as the rough-stemmed ink cap, is a species of fungus belonging to the family Trametes. It is characterized by its distinctive, dark, ink-like cap that often has a rough or fibrous texture. The stem is usually slender and may have a slightly bulbous base. It typically grows on decaying wood, especially in moist, temperate environments. This fungus is notable for its ecological role in breaking down organic matter in forest ecosystems."
