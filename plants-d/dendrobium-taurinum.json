    "intro": "Dendrobium taurinum, commonly known as the Taurine Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces tall, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and it bears clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Dendrobium taurinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
