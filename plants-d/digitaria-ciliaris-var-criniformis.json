It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that cover the leaf blades and inflorescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It produces spikelets that are loosely arranged in panicles, and its seeds are small and wind-dispersed. This species is often found in sandy or well-drained soils and is adapted to warm climates."
