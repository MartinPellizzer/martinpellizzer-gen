It is characterized by its smooth, light grey bark and large, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Dodonaea sinuolata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to provide shade."
