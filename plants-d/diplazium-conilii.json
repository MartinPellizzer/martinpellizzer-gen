    "intro": "Diplazium conilii, commonly known as the coastal fern, is a species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from salt spray and strong winds. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in humid, maritime conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or reddish and appear in clusters, contributing to its ecological role in coastal ecosystems. Diplazium conilii plays an important part in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
