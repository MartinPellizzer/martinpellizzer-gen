    "intro": "Dalea adenopoda, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Dalea adenopoda is adapted to arid environments and is considered a valuable plant for stabilizing soils in ecological restoration projects."
