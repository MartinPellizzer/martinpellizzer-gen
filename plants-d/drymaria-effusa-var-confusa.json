It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
