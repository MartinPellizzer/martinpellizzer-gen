    "intro": "Deyeuxia sichuanensis, commonly known as the Sichuan hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan Province in China. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems with small, awnless spikelets that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces wind-pollinated flowers. Deyeuxia sichuanensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
