    "intro": "Delphinium occidentale subsp. cucullatum, commonly known as the western larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care."
