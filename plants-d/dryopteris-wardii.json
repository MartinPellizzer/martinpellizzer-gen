    "intro": "Dryopteris wardii, commonly known as the Ward's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and thrives in shaded forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil. The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
