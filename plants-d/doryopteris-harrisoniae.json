    "intro": "Doryopteris harrisoniae, commonly known as Harrison's shield fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family, characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
