    "intro": "Didymosperma humile, commonly known as the dwarf starfruit, is a small shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruit but are typically less common in cultivation. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and often have a glossy surface, while its stems are woody and branched. Didymosperma humile is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
