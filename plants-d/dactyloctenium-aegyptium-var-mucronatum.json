    "intro": "Dactyloctenium aegyptium var. mucronatum, commonly known as Egyptian dactyloctenium, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features slender, wiry stems and small, pale green leaves that are often rolled in the bud. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, pale brown flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil. This species is often found in disturbed areas and can be invasive in certain regions."
