    "intro": "Dvorakia alyssifolia, commonly known as the lesser dandelion, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive pappus-equipped seeds for wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and its membership in the Asteraceae family."
