    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 wechteriana, commonly known as the giant evergreen wood fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octopleura. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. The fronds are divided into multiple segments, with a distinctive shape that resembles the foliage of its parent species."
