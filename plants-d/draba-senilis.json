    "intro": "Draba senilis, commonly known as the old man's beard, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically forms dense mats of foliage, with basal leaves that are lobed or divided. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Draba senilis is notable for its ability to survive in harsh, cold environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
