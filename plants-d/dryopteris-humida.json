    "intro": "Dryopteris humida, commonly known as the Moist Wood Fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. The spores are released from sori located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
