    "intro": "Dracunculus muscivorus, commonly known as the hogweed, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant that can grow up to 2 meters tall, featuring large, umbrella-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing compounds that can cause severe skin irritation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources. Its name \"muscivorus\" refers to its ability to attract and consume insects, which it does through its sticky, glandular hairs."
