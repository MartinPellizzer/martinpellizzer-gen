    "intro": "Dicranopygium novogranatense, commonly known as the Colombian fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate fronds with a distinctive, often recurved shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Dicranopygium novogranatense plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
