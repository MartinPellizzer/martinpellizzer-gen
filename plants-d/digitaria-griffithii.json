    "intro": "Digitaria griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's digitaria, is a grass species native to parts of Asia, including India and China. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, flowering structures typical of the grass family. Digitaria griffithii is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
