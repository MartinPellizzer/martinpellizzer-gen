    "intro": "Deparia subfluvialis, commonly known as the river shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams and in humid forests. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in suitable habitats."
