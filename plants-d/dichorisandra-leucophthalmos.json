    "intro": "Dichorisandra leucophthalmos, commonly known as the white-eyed cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
