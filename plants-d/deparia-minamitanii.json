    "intro": "Deparia minamitanii, commonly known as the Minamitanii wood fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forests or along stream banks. Its spores are released from small, fleshy sorus structures located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Deparia minamitanii is considered a species of conservation concern."
