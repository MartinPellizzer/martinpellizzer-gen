    "intro": "Dryopteris longipilosa, commonly known as the long-hair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help stabilize the soil. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
