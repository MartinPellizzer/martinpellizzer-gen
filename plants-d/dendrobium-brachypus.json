    "intro": "Dendrobium brachypus, commonly known as the short-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its pseudobulbs are short and stout, and its leaves are narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern. Dendrobium brachypus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
