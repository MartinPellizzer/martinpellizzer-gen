    "intro": "Dyckia acutiflora, commonly known as the sharp-flowered dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dyckia acutiflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and resilience."
