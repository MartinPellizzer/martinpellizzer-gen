It is characterized by its golden-yellow foliage, which distinguishes it from the typical green color of the standard variety. This plant is native to Europe and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a tufted growth habit and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences. The botanical features of this variant make it valuable for ornamental purposes and in certain agricultural settings."
