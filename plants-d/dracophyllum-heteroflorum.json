It belongs to the heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, adapted to withstand the dry conditions of its native habitat. Dracophyllum heteroflorum is often found in heathlands and coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
