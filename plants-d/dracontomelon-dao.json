    "intro": "Dracontomelon dao, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dark, dense wood. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a glossy appearance. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Due to its valuable timber, the species is threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
