    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis subsp. sphagnicola, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in acidic, moist habitats such as bogs and peatlands, where it forms dense colonies. The plant has a slender, often branched stem that bears several pale green to yellowish flowers. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil in which it thrives. The species is relatively rare and is often protected due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
