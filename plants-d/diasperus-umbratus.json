    "intro": "Diasperus umbratus, commonly known as the shadow spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Diasperus umbratus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
