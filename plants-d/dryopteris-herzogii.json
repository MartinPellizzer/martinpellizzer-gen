    "intro": "Dryopteris herzogii, commonly known as the Herzig's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
