    "intro": "Drymonia mucronulosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit with rhizomatous stems. The plant produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its spore-bearing structures, called soruses, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Drymonia mucronulosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats."
