    "intro": "Doodia caudata, commonly known as the cat-tail fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system and its unique, grass-like foliage that forms a rosette structure. The plant produces sporangia in clusters at the tips of its fronds, which are typically located at the ends of the stems. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden settings. Doodia caudata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid environments."
