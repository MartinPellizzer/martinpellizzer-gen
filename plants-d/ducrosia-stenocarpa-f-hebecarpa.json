    "intro": "Ducrosia stenocarpa f. hebecarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited ducrosia, is a unique variant of the species Ducrosia stenocarpa. It is a shrub native to South Africa, characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by distinctive, narrow, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and noteworthy plant in botanical collections."
