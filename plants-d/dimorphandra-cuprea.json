    "intro": "Dimorphandra cuprea, commonly known as the copper flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The tree is known for its striking copper-colored flowers that appear in clusters during the dry season. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like leaflets. Dimorphandra cuprea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates."
