    "intro": "Dryopteris biserialis, commonly known as the biserial wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that are typically divided into two rows of pinnae, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. Dryopteris biserialis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its graceful, upright growth habit."
