It features slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces spikes of small, tubular blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a pinnate arrangement, giving it a distinctive appearance. Dracocephalum pinnatum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties."
