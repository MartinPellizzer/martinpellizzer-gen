    "intro": "Delphinium trichophorum var. lasiostylum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variant is closely related to other delphinium species but is distinguished by its unique floral structure and habitat preferences."
