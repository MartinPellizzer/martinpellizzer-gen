    "intro": "Dryopteris supraimpressa, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a distinctive shield-shaped outline. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds."
