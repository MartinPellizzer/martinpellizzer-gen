    "intro": "Dryopteris echinospora, commonly known as the holly fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its distinctive, holly-like spore cases on the underside of its fronds, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a serrated or toothed margin. Dryopteris echinospora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
