    "intro": "Dombeya tiliacea, commonly known as the silky dombeya, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has soft, hairy leaves that give it a silvery appearance, and its stems are often covered in a similar fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in Mediterranean climates. Dombeya tiliacea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
