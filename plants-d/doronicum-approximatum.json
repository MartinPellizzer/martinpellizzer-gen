It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Doronicum approximatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
