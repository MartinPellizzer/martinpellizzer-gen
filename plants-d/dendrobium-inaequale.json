    "intro": "Dendrobium inaequale, commonly known as the unequal dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with a distinctive pattern of dark markings. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged spirally around the stem, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in its natural habitat. Dendrobium inaequale is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
