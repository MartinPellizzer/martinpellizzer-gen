    "intro": "Dorcapteris cervina, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in a tight spiral. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of the stems, with each spikelet containing several tiny flowers. Dorcapteris cervina is usually found in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
