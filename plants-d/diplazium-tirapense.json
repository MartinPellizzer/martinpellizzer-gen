The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and is native to Southeast Asia. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its natural habitat."
