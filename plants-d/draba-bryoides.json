    "intro": "Draba bryoides, commonly known as the moss-like whitlow grass, is a small, low-growing plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in moist, calcareous soils in alpine and arctic regions. The plant features tiny, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Draba bryoides is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh environments due to its compact structure and slow growth rate. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky and mountainous areas."
