    "intro": "Dimorphanthera doctersii, commonly known as the yellow ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a unique growth habit, with a slender, creeping rhizome and small, strap-like leaves. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
