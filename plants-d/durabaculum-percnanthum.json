    "intro": "Durabaculum percnanthum, commonly known as the hardy rock orchid, is a rare and resilient plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions, including extreme temperature fluctuations. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of violet and white, typically blooming in late spring. Its root system is deep and strong, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices and access moisture from deep within the soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
