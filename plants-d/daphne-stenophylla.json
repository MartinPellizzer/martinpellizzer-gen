    "intro": "Daphne stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved daphne, is a shrub native to the western United States, particularly California. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often in coastal or inland mountainous regions. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Daphne stenophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
