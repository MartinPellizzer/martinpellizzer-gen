    "intro": "Dryopteris diversivenosa, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that often exhibit a striking variegation of colors, including green, brown, and sometimes even purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are wiry and can spread to form dense colonies, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium."
