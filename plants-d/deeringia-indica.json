    "intro": "Deeringia indica, commonly known as the Indian thornapple, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-like plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves, and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Deeringia indica is often found in disturbed areas and can thrive in a variety of soil types."
