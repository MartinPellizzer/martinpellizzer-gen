    "intro": "Dryopteris alta, commonly known as the tall wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they are typically dark green with a glossy sheen. Dryopteris alta thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
