    "intro": "Dracula trigonopetala, commonly known as the \"Crimson Dracula,\" is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that resemble the wings of a bat, with deep red petals and a contrasting white lip. The plant thrives in high-altitude, humid environments with partial shade and well-drained soil. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized adaptations to its microhabitat, including its epiphytic growth habit and intricate pollination mechanisms. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
