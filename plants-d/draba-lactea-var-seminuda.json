    "intro": "Draba lactea var. seminuda, commonly known as the naked milkweed or white sand draba, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silvery-white leaves that are covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
