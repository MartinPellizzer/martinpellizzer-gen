    "intro": "Dryopteris concinna, commonly known as the barren wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically gray-green in color and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and allow it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. Dryopteris concinna is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
