    "intro": "Digitaria velutina var. glabrescens, commonly known as velvetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, wetlands, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, bract-like structures that bear the flowering parts. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a cover crop."
