    "intro": "Davallia berteroana, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces new plantlets, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a rough, textured surface that helps it retain moisture."
