    "intro": "Dendrobium auroroseum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple stems that can become woody over time. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a white or pink throat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Dendrobium auroroseum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
