    "intro": "Dupatya pungens, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its opposite leaves, which are covered in fine, venomous hairs that cause an itchy rash upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions around the world. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its roots are often used in traditional medicine. Despite its defensive mechanisms, it plays an important ecological role by providing food for certain insects and animals."
