    "intro": "Dasygrammitis crassifrons, commonly known as the broad-fronded sword fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in the substrate. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, tropical climates."
