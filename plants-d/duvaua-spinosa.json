    "intro": "Duvaua spinosa, commonly known as the spiny duvaua, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Duvaua spinosa is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest or scrubland environments."
