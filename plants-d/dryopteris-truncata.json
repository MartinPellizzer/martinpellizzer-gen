    "intro": "Dryopteris truncata, commonly known as the interrupted fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that have a unique, interrupted pattern of pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
