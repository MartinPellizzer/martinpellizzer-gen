    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudodontoloma, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features a compact, upright growth habit with fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate climates."
