The plant typically blooms during the late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and containers. Dicymanthes breviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
