    "intro": "Dendrobium kabanense, commonly known as the Kabanense orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are covered in clusters of small, green leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Dendrobium kabanense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
