    "intro": "Dortmanna melleri, commonly known as the Meller's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while its stems are flexible and can root at the nodes. Dortmanna melleri is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the nutrients obtained from captured prey."
