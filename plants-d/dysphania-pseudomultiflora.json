It typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm and features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by triangular, spiny fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Dysphania pseudomultiflora is a common weed that can compete with crops for nutrients and water."
