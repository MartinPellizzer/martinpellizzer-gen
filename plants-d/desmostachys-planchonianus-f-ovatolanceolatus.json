    "intro": "Desmostachys planchonianus f. ovatolanceolatus, commonly known as the ovate-lanceolate form of the plantain, is a variant of the plantain species characterized by its broad, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The leaves are typically longer than they are wide, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in woodland or shaded areas. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This form is notable for its adaptability and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
