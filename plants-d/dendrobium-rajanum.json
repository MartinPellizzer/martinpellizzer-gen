    "intro": "Dendrobium rajanum, commonly known as the Rajanum orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to thrive in humid climates. Its roots are fibrous and often form dense mats, helping it anchor in rocky or soil substrates. Dendrobium rajanum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
