    "intro": "Delphinium dasystachyon subsp. szowitsianum, commonly known as the Szowitsianum larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces numerous small, spurred flowers arranged in dense spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are deeply lobed and emit a mild, often unpleasant odor, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is typically cultivated in well-drained soils in full sun."
