    "intro": "Draba longirostra var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the glabrous beak vetch, is a low-growing, perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of linear, glabrous leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes along the flowering stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive beak-like floral structure and its smooth, hairless appearance."
