    "intro": "Dendrophthora mancinellae, commonly known as the ghost fungus, is a dimorphic basidiomycete that exhibits both mycelial and fruiting body stages. It is a wood-rotting fungus that primarily infects living trees, particularly those in the genus *Fagus*. The fruiting bodies of this fungus are small, ephemeral, and often appear as pale, ghostly structures on the bark of infected trees. Its mycelium colonizes the inner tissues of the host, causing decay and weakening the tree's structural integrity. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is a rare and understudied species in the fungal kingdom."
