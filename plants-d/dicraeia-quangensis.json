    "intro": "Dicraeia quangensis, commonly known as the Quang Province cycad, is a rare cycad species native to Vietnam. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
