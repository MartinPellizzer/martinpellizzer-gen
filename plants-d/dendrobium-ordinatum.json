    "intro": "Dendrobium ordinatum, commonly known as the common orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often in clusters. Its stems are typically erect and can become woody with age. Dendrobium ordinatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
