    "intro": "Diospyros neilgerrensis, commonly known as the Neilgiri persimmon, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange-red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at moderate elevations. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
