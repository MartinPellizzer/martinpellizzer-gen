It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, feathery foliage that forms a rounded crown. The leaves are needle-like and arranged in whorls, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. This plant is well adapted to the temperate climate of its native habitat and is often found in forested areas."
