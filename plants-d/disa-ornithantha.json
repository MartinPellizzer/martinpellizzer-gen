    "intro": "Disa ornithantha, commonly known as the bird's nest orchid, is a species native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. The plant features a short rhizome with a cluster of fleshy, green leaves that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. Its flowers are small, tubular, and usually pink or purple, arranged in a loose spike. Disa ornithantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
