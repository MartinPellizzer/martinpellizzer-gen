It is characterized by its dense, fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy blooms. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring careful handling and placement."
