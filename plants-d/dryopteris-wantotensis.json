    "intro": "Dryopteris wantotensis, commonly known as the Wantotens fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy tissue, which helps in water retention. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species."
