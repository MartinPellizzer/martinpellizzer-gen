    "intro": "Dasysphaera lanata, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater environments in Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest aquatic insects. It thrives in still or slow-moving water, often in marshy or swampy areas. Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor aquatic habitats."
