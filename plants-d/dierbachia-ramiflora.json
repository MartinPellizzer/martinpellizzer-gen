    "intro": "Dierbachia ramiflora, commonly known as the flaxleaf cycad, is a unique plant native to the humid lowland forests of Madagascar. It is a member of the cycad family, characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant conserve water in its tropical environment. Dierbachia ramiflora produces cones instead of flowers, with the male and female cones occurring on separate plants. This plant is also notable for its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living for several decades."
