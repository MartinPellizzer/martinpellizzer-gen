It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
