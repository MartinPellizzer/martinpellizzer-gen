    "intro": "Dactylorhiza elodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces tall, spike-like inflorescences with small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. It has a complex root system that includes mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for nutrient uptake. Dactylorhiza elodes is a perennial herb that blooms from late spring to early summer."
