    "intro": "Desmodium stipulaceum, commonly known as the hairy bean or false tickseed, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Desmodium stipulaceum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
