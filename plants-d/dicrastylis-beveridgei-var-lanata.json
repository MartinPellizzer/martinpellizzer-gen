    "intro": "Dicrastylis beveridgei var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly dicrastylis, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance. The plant features dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in wet or seasonally waterlogged soils, often found in swampy or marshy habitats. This variant is distinguished by its soft, lanate (woolly) texture on its leaves, which helps in identifying it from other species in the genus."
