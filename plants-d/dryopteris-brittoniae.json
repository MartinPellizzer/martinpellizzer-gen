    "intro": "Dryopteris brittoniae, commonly known as the Britton's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant features a stout, short rhizome with a dense covering of brown, fibrous roots. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and the sori are clustered in lines along the margins of the fronds. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky habitats."
