It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Decaloba pallida is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
