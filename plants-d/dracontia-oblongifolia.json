    "intro": "Dracontia oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed dragon fern, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its elongated, strap-like fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Dracontia oblongifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
