    "intro": "Dryas octopetala f. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved mountain avens, is a frost-tolerant shrub native to alpine and arctic regions. It features compact, low-growing stems with hairy, dark green leaves that are typically entire, giving it its \"integrifolia\" designation. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. This variety is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
