    "intro": "Diplostephium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved burrgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense heads, which are followed by spiny, burr-like fruits. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
