    "intro": "Droogmansia dorae, commonly known as the Dorae's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and striking, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with dappled sunlight, often growing on tree branches or rocky outcrops. Its delicate appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and its rarity, Droogmansia dorae is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
