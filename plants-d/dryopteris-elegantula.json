    "intro": "Dryopteris elegantula, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It features delicate, lace-like fronds with a golden hue on the underside, which become more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are short and produce a dense, mat-forming growth habit. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
