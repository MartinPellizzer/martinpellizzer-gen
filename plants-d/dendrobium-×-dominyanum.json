    "intro": "Dendrobium \u00d7 dominyanum, commonly known as the Dominyan orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, pendant-like inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated for horticultural purposes."
