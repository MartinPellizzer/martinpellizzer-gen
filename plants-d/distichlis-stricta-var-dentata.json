    "intro": "Distichlis stricta var. dentata, commonly known as the saltgrass or saltbush, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive serrated edge. The plant is highly salt-tolerant and thrives in sandy or saline soils, making it well-suited for coastal dunes and wetlands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
