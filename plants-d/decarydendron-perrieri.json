    "intro": "Decarydendron perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's tamarind, is a species of flowering plant in the Fabaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. The seeds are enclosed within the fruit and are often dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
