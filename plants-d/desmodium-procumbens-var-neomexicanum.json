    "intro": "Desmodium procumbens var. neomexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican desmodium, is a low-growing, herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. The species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
