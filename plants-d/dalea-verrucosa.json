It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a shallow root system and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Dalea verrucosa plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native range."
