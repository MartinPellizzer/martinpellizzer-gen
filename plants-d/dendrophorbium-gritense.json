    "intro": "Dendrophorbium gritense, commonly known as the Gritten Rock-rose, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with succulent stems that store water, aiding survival in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Dendrophorbium gritense is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall."
