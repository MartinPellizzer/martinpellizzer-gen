    "intro": "Dryopteris gemmulifera, commonly known as the gemmiferous wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces spores in compact, club-like structures called gemmae, which are borne on the underside of its fertile fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in temperate climates."
