    "intro": "Duvigneaudia inopinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a rare aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by tiny, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
