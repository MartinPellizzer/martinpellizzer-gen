    "intro": "Disparago gongylodes, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like compound leaves and showy, white flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant can grow up to 5 meters tall, making it one of the tallest members of the Apiaceae family. Its stems are covered in reddish-purple spots and have coarse hairs, while its roots are thick and fleshy. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
