    "intro": "Duschekia viridis subsp. brembana, commonly known as the Bremban green bellflower, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, bell-shaped green flowers that bloom in late summer. This subspecies thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous environments. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
