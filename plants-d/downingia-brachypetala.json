It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
