    "intro": "Dryopteris sprengelii var. mollipilosa, commonly known as the soft-hairy wood fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in soft, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
