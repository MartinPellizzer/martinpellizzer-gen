    "intro": "Dendromecon, commonly known as the devil's Trumpet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Papaveraceae. It is native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in dry, open habitats. The plant is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers, which are often clustered in racemes at the ends of its stems. Dendromecon species are shrubs or subshrubs with woody stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value but can be invasive in certain regions."
