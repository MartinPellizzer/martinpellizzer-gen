    "intro": "Dryopteris doiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a fine, rusty-brown marginal fringe. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right growing conditions."
