    "intro": "Dendrobium brachycentrum, commonly known as the short-stemmed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces racemes of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in two rows along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
