    "intro": "Dryopteris reptans, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with dark, leathery fronds that are divided into lance-shaped pinnae. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing year-round interest in garden settings."
