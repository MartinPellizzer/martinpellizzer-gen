    "intro": "Dendrobium \u00d7 wiganiae, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with dense, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, typically during the late winter to early spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Dendrobium \u00d7 wiganiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for indoor and greenhouse displays."
