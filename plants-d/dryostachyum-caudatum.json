    "intro": "Dryostachyum caudatum, commonly known as the panicle grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, branching panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to saturated soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces wind-pollinated flowers that contribute to its ecological role in supporting local wildlife. Dryostachyum caudatum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial species."
