    "intro": "Delissea calycina, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its fruits are berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. Delissea calycina is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem."
