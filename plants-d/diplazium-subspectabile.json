    "intro": "Diplazium subspectabile, commonly known as the slender sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are bipinnate, with closely spaced, narrow pinnae that give it a finely divided appearance. Diplazium subspectabile thrives in humid, shaded habitats such as forest undergrowth and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
