    "intro": "Dryopteris laxa, commonly known as the loose fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green and have a slightly curled appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris laxa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of garden settings."
