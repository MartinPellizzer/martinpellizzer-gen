    "intro": "Diplazium subpolypodioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a member of the family Dryopteridaceae. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, elongated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a soft, leathery texture and a distinct, intricate pattern of pinnae."
