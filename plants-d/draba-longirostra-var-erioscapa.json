    "intro": "Draba longirostra var. erioscapa, commonly known as the long-beaked rock-cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats on soil or among stones. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of hair, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is distinguished by its elongated flowering stems and hairy leaf bases, adaptations that contribute to its survival in arctic and subarctic regions."
