    "intro": "Desmodium microcarpum, commonly known as small-fruited burr medic, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in groups of three. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Desmodium microcarpum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and forage production."
