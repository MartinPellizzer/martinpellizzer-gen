    "intro": "Dracula lowii, commonly known as the \"Venus' tears\" orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescence that bears clusters of pale pink to white flowers with intricate, almost translucent petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture. Dracula lowii is also notable for its conservation status, being listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and over-collection."
