It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly folded. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is used in ecological restoration projects and as a ornamental plant in some regions."
