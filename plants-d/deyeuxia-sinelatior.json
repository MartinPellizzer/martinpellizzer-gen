It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along stream banks or in swampy areas. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, usually greenish or brownish in color. Deyeuxia sinelatior plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
