It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of spurred blue or violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its striking floral display and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens and alpine gardens."
