    "intro": "Dryopteris eriocaulis, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and establish itself in suitable habitats. The fronds are biennial, with the fiddleheads emerging in the spring and unfurling throughout the growing season."
