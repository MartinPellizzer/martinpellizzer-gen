    "intro": "Dolichos uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower dolichos, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, hairy stems that twine around supports, and its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Dolichos uniflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
