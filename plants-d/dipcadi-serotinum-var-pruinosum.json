    "intro": "Dipcadi serotinum var. pruinosum, commonly known as the sticky squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy, sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and can remain dormant for extended periods. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
