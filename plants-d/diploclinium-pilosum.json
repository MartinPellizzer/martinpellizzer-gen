    "intro": "Diploclinium pilosum, commonly known as the hairy diploclinium, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadside verges and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warmer climates."
