    "intro": "Drymoglossum confertum, commonly known as the dense-leaf fern, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, overlapping leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette form. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. Drymoglossum confertum is well-adapted to withstand desiccation, making it a common sight in dry, rocky habitats."
