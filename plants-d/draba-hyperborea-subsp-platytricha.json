    "intro": "Draba hyperborea subsp. platytricha, commonly known as the broadleaf sandstone mustard, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches heights of 5\u201320 cm and features basal leaves that are broad and fleshy, adapted to cold and nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant relies on wind dispersal for its seeds. Draba hyperborea subsp. platytricha is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in mountainous and tundra habitats."
