    "intro": "Drimia trichophylla, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that bears the showy blooms, which typically appear in late winter to early spring. Its bulbs are fleshy and store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Drimia trichophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
