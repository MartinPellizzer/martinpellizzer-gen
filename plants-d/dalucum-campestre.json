    "intro": "Dalucum campestre, commonly known as field spurge, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Dalucum campestre is known for its latex-containing sap, which can cause skin irritation."
