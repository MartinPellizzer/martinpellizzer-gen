    "intro": "Dioscorea maynensis, commonly known as the Mayan yam, is a member of the Dioscoreaceae family and is native to Central America. It is a climbing vine that produces tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. Its leaves are heart-shaped and large, with a rough texture, while its flowers are typically white or pale green. The tubers of D. maynensis are rich in starch and have been traditionally used in indigenous cultures for food and traditional medicine."
