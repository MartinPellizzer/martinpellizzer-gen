    "intro": "Duranta erecta var. domingensis, commonly known as the yellow duranta, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It features showy, tubular flowers that range from yellow to orange, often with a red throat, which attract hummingbirds and other pollinators. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in warm climates."
