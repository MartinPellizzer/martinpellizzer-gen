It typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas, characterized by its upright stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers in racemes, followed by distinctive bur-like seed pods that aid in seed dispersal. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought-resistant features. Its botanical structure reflects its role as a pioneer species in disturbed soils."
