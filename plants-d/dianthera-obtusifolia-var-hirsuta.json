It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors or rocky outcrops. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
