    "intro": "Dioon strobilaceum, commonly known as the Mexican mountain cycad, is a species of cycad native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, dry climate. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
