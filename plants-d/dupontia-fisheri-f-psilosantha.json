    "intro": "Dupontia fisheri f. psilosantha, commonly known as the dwarf sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal dunes of California. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in stabilized dune environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
