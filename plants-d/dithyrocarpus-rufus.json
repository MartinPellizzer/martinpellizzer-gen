    "intro": "Dithyrocarpus rufus, commonly known as the red-leafed ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and striking red foliage, which becomes more vibrant during the dry season. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. Due to its ornamental value and durable timber, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and for reforestation projects."
