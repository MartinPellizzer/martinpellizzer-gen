    "intro": "Dryopteris maximowiczii, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
