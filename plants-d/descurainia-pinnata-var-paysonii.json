    "intro": "Descurainia pinnata var. paysonii, commonly known as Payson's tansy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, yellow flowers and slender, branching stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has compound leaves with pinnate arrangements. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Payson's tansy is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
