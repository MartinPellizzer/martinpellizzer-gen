It features compact, lance-shaped leaves and produces tiny, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically blooms during the summer months, and its growth is slow, making it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or under controlled conditions."
