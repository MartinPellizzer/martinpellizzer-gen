    "intro": "Dendrochilum latilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed tree orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, airy substrates for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
