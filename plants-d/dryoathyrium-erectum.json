    "intro": "Dryoathyrium erectum, commonly known as the erect fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright, slender fronds that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryoathyrium erectum plays an important ecological role by contributing to forest floor cover and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
