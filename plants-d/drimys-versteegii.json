    "intro": "Drimys versteegii, commonly known as the Chilean wax tree, is a slow-growing evergreen tree native to central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
