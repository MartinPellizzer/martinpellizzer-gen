    "intro": "Draba aurea f. decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate goldcup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often carpeting the ground in rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is distinguished by its prostrate form, which differs from the upright growth of the typical Draba aurea."
