    "intro": "Draba dubia var. laevipes, commonly known as the smoothleaf whitlowgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bright yellow flowers during the spring, which are arranged in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
