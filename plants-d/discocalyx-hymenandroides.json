    "intro": "Discocalyx hymenandroides, commonly known as the white-flowered sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in dense, terminal spikes, which bloom during the summer months. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
