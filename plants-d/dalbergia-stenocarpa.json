    "intro": "Dalbergia stenocarpa, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces hard, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its density and fine grain. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland areas. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
