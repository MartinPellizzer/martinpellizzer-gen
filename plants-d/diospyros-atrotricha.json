    "intro": "Diospyros atrotricha, commonly known as the black ebony tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Ebenaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania. The tree is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, often with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round berries that are typically red when mature."
