It is characterized by its distinctive two-jointed stem and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its root system is fibrous and has been historically used in traditional medicine. Dicerma biarticulatum thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded environments."
