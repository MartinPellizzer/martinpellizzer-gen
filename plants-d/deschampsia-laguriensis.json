    "intro": "Deschampsia laguriensis, commonly known as the Laguriens grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant typically forms dense mats or clumps, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
