    "intro": "Damnacanthus indicus var. giganteus, commonly known as giant flame acanthus, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, red-orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant has a woody stem with a distinctive, zigzagging pattern and can grow up to several meters in height. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a velvety texture, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting floral display."
