    "intro": "Diaperia drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's diaperwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and compound umbels of small white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Diaperia drummondii is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in Native American herbal practices."
