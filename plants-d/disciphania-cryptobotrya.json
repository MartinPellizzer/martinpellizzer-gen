    "intro": "Disciphania cryptobotrya, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
