    "intro": "Dendrobium polyphyllum, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features long, segmented stems that can be evergreen or deciduous depending on the environment. Its flowers are usually yellow or golden in color, with a distinctive lip-shaped petal that is often more vividly colored. Dendrobium polyphyllum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its striking floral display."
