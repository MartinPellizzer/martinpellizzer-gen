    "intro": "Dendrophylax funalis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces striking white or pale green flowers with a distinct, hood-like structure. Its leaves are typically small and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
