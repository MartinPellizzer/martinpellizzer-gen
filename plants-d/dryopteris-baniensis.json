    "intro": "Dryopteris baniensis, commonly known as the Baniense Shield Fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically leathery and dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
