    "intro": "Decaloba retusa, commonly known as the smoothleaf arrowroot, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Araceae family, which includes plants like taro and calla lilies. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and glossy, often with a waxy texture. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant is valued for its starchy rhizomes, which are used in traditional cuisine and as a thickening agent in cooking."
