    "intro": "Dracaena senegambica, commonly known as the African dragon tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and long, strap-like leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy sheen. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters at the tips of the stems. Dracaena senegambica thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
