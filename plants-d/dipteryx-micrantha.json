It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by specific insects. The tree's most notable feature is its heavy, woody pods that contain the edible Brazil nuts. It thrives in humid tropical climates and requires a long growing season. Due to its ecological and economic importance, it is a key species in rainforest conservation efforts."
