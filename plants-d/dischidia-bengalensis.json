    "intro": "Dischidia bengalensis, commonly known as the Bengal fig or climbing fig, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often hidden within the leaf axils, followed by fig-like structures that contain its true fruits. Dischidia bengalensis is often used in horticulture as a trailing plant due to its ability to climb and its attractive foliage. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
