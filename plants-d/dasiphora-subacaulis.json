    "intro": "Dasiphora subacaulis, commonly known as the creeping fireweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit, with numerous slender stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often harsh habitat. Dasiphora subacaulis is adapted to rocky and disturbed soils, making it a common sight in alpine and arctic environments."
