    "intro": "Danthonia antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southern hemisphere. It thrives in cold, temperate climates and is particularly adapted to high-altitude and alpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in rocky soils and is a key component of alpine vegetation in regions such as New Zealand and southern South America. Its hardy nature makes it an important plant for stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
