    "intro": "Dendrobium vanderwateri, commonly known as the Vanderwater's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
