It features showy, fragrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of yellow to orange. The leaves are opposite, hence the varietal name, and are heart-shaped with a smooth texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
