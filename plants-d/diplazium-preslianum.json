    "intro": "Diplazium preslianum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a smooth, glossy surface, with sporangia clustered in sori along the margins of the leaflets. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides, and it plays a role in maintaining soil stability in its habitat. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important component of the understory vegetation in tropical regions."
