    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 thwaitesii, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis. It is a robust evergreen fern characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish or golden hue on the underside. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, which are typically found in the upper part of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage. This fern is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and has been cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes."
