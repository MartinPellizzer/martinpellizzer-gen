    "intro": "Decaspora involucrata, commonly known as the clustered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its reproductive structures include small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Decaspora involucrata plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to harsh climates."
