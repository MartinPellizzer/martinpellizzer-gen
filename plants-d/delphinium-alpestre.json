    "intro": "Delphinium alpestre, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture that helps it withstand cold and arid conditions. Delphinium alpestre is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
