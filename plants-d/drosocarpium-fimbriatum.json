    "intro": "Drosocarpium fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed cup lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its cup-shaped thallus with a smooth, often reddish or orange-colored surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is typically found on decaying wood in temperate regions. Its fringed margins and distinctive coloration make it easily identifiable among other lichen species."
