It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers with distinctive hairy structures around the base. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and biodiversity."
