    "intro": "Dracula \u00d7 pinasensis, commonly known as the hybrid vampire orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dracula tricarinata and Dracula pinzari. It is native to the cloud forests of Ecuador and is characterized by its striking, velvety dark red petals and sepals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures. Its flowers are typically small and bloom in late winter or early spring, adding a dramatic and exotic touch to orchid collections. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
