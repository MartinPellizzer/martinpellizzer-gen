    "intro": "Dendrobium pedilochilum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, often in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the dry season. Its stems are typically clustered and can be quite long, sometimes reaching several feet in length. Dendrobium pedilochilum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
