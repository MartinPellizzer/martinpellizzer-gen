    "intro": "Dendrobium metachilinum, commonly known as the orchid bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are often yellow or orange with red markings, attracting specific pollinators. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. Dendrobium metachilinum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
