It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Its ecological importance includes serving as a food source for native pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat."
