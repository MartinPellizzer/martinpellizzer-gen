    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa subsp. holciformis, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures on its leaves. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as wet meadows and marshes, and is often found in areas with poor to moderately fertile soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
