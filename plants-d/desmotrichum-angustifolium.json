    "intro": "Desmotrichum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf desert aster, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions, with small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss. It produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its resilience and ecological importance, it is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
