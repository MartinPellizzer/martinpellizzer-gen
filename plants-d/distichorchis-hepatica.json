    "intro": "Distichorchis hepatica, commonly known as the liverleaf orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial herb with a distinctive rosette of dark green, ovate leaves that resemble the shape of a liver, hence its common name. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear small, pale green to white flowers arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, often growing near streams or in swampy areas. The species is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and specialized flowering structure, which are adaptations to its specific ecological niche."
