    "intro": "Diarina sylvatica, commonly known as the forest diarina, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale purple flowers bloom in clusters during late spring to early summer. Diarina sylvatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
