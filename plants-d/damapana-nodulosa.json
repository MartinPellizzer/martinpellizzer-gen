It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, attracting various pollinators. Its unique nodular growth patterns on the stems make it easily identifiable and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
