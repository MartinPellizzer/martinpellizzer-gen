It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, seed-filled capsules at the base of its flowers. Dianthera virgata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections."
