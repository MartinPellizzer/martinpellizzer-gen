    "intro": "Deparia petersenii subsp. petersenii, commonly known as the Petersen's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a typical feature of ferns."
