    "intro": "Dalbergia dyeriana, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood with a rich, aromatic scent. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by legume-like pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
