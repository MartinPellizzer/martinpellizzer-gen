    "intro": "Damasonium polyspermum var. minimum, commonly known as the lesser water shield, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, floating just above the water surface. Its flowers are small and white, clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its delicate structure, it is often found in still or slow-moving waters with soft, muddy substrates."
