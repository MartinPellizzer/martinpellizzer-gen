These plants are typically herbaceous and produce small, bell-shaped flowers that are often white or pale blue in color. Drabopsis species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe and Asia. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The flowers are usually clustered in umbels or racemes, and the plants are known for their delicate appearance and early spring blooming period."
