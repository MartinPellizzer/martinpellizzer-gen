    "intro": "Decarydendron helenae, commonly known as Helen's hibiscus, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forests. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
