    "intro": "Dieteria canescens var. nebraskana, commonly known as the Nebraska bluestem, is a native grass species found primarily in the central United States. It is characterized by its bluish-gray foliage and is typically found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant has a clump-forming growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive silver-gray appearance due to dense pubescence. This variety is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions and plays an important role in stabilizing soil in native grassland ecosystems."
