It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, succulent leaves and produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a valuable species for ecological studies in Mediterranean-type climates."
