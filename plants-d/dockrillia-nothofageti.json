It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat."
