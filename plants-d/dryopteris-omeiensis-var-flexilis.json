    "intro": "Dryopteris omeiensis var. flexilis, commonly known as the flexible wood fern, is a variant of the Omei wood fern native to China. It is a perennial fern characterized by its distinctive fronds that are often curved and have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the Dryopteris genus. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
