    "intro": "Drimycarpus racemosus var. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved drimycarpus, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically longer than they are wide. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its potential use in traditional medicine."
