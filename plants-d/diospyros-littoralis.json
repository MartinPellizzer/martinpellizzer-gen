    "intro": "Diospyros littoralis, commonly known as the coastal persimmon, is a small evergreen tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-gray bark and elliptical, glossy leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red berries that are edible when ripe. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in mangrove or coastal forest ecosystems. Due to its adaptability to brackish conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal environments."
