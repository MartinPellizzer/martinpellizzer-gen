It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, typically white and purple. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its growth is slow, and it requires specific conditions to flourish, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some areas."
