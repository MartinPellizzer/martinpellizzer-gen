    "intro": "Drymaria longepedunculata, commonly known as the long peduncle sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white to pink flowers that bloom in summer, often arranged in elongated clusters. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in dry environments. Drymaria longepedunculata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
