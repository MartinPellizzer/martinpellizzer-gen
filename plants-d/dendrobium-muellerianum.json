    "intro": "Dendrobium muellerianum, commonly known as the Mueller's orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, branched stem system with numerous pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and lavender, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are strap-like, fleshy, and arranged in two rows along the stem. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
