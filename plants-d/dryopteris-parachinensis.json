    "intro": "Dryopteris parachinensis, commonly known as the Chinese wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant features a creeping rhizome with numerous fiddlehead-like buds that unfurl into compound leaves. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks."
