    "intro": "Desideria mirabilis, commonly known as the celestial flame orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its vibrant, bi-color petals that range from deep crimson to soft gold, creating an eye-catching display. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its blooming season occurs during the late spring and early summer, producing clusters of fragrant flowers that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, Desideria mirabilis is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
