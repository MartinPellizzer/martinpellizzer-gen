It is typically found growing in moist, sandy or gravelly soils along riverbanks and stream edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in fine hairs. Draba rivularis is adapted to harsh, wet environments and is often an indicator of stable, nutrient-poor soils."
