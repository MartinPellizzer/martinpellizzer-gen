    "intro": "Desmodium duclouxii, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by oblong, flat pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Desmodium duclouxii is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a useful plant in soil enrichment."
