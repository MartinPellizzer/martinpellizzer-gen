    "intro": "Dioscorea melanophyma, commonly known as the dark-skinned yam, is a perennial vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its hairy, tuberous roots that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, green, heart-shaped leaves and bears yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its tubers are valued for their starchy content and have been used in various culinary and medicinal applications. However, the plant contains toxic compounds and requires careful preparation before consumption."
