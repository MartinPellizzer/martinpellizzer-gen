    "intro": "Dendrocnide vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis stinging tree, is a member of the Dendrocnidinae subfamily within the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of the Pacific, including parts of Australia and New Guinea. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive, glandular hairs that release a potent irritant when touched. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a dense, bushy structure. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems and has been the subject of botanical studies due to its unique defensive mechanisms."
