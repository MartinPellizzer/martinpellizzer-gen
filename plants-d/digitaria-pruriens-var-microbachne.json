    "intro": "Digitaria pruriens var. microbachne, commonly known as sand grass or itchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs, which can cause skin irritation in some individuals. It is adapted to thrive in environments with low soil fertility and high sunlight exposure. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important plant in certain ecological contexts."
