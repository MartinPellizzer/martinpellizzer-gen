    "intro": "Dendrobium aridum, commonly known as the desert orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to arid regions of Australia. It has a unique growth habit, with a rhizome that produces a cluster of fleshy, green pseudobulbs. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months. It is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, dry soils and can go through periods of dormancy. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xerophytic environments and a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardening."
