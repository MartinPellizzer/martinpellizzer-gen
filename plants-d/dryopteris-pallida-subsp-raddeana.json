    "intro": "Dryopteris pallida subsp. raddeana, commonly known as the pink fern, is a perennial fern native to parts of Asia and North America. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often tinged with a pale pink or reddish hue, especially when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
