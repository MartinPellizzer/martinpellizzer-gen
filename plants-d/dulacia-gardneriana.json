    "intro": "Dulacia gardneriana, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, violet-pink bracts that surround its small, yellow flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruit, though they are not related to the common starfruit. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Dulacia gardneriana is also valued for its ability to adapt to various soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
