    "intro": "Digitaria badia, commonly known as the silvergrass or whitegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Digitaria badia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland ecosystems."
