    "intro": "Duvalia caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered duvalia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with small, narrow leaves arranged in a rosette. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is cultivated in gardens as a low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plant."
