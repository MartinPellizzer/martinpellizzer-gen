    "intro": "Daphne papyracea var. xichouensis, commonly known as the Xichou daphne, is a rare evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, papery leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist climates and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. It is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
