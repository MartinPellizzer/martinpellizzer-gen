It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its compact rosette of basal leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils in alpine or arctic environments. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh climates. This subspecies is notable for its ability to survive in extreme conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
