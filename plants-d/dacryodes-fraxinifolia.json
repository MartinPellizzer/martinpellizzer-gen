    "intro": "Dacryodes fraxinifolia, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It typically grows up to 15 meters tall with a dense, rounded crown and smooth, dark grey bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic, with a leathery texture and a glossy surface. Its small, fragrant flowers are white or pale yellow and are borne in clusters, followed by small, round, yellowish fruits. The wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it useful in furniture and carpentry."
