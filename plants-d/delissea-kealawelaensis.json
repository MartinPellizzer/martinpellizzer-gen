    "intro": "Delissea kealawelaensis, commonly known as the Kealawela fern, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the tropical rainforests of Hawaii. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in the undergrowth of dense vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Delissea kealawelaensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
