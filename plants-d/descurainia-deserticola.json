It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its yellow flowers bloom in early summer, and it produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. Descurainia deserticola is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
