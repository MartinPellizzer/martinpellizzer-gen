    "intro": "Dryopteris hirtisora, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The hairy wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
