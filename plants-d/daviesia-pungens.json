    "intro": "Daviesia pungens, commonly known as the sticky devil, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a sticky, resinous substance from its stems, which gives it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Daviesia pungens is a hardy species that is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment."
