    "intro": "Distictis racemosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and fragrant, small white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous coating. It is valued for its hard, dark wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and musical instruments. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
