    "intro": "Dalbergiella welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia tree, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia. It is characterized by its two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant has a woody stem that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, with a distinctive branching pattern. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Dalbergiella welwitschii is adapted to survive in arid conditions, with a deep root system that helps it access underground water sources."
