    "intro": "Dactylorhiza smolikana, commonly known as the Smolik's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a pseudobulb-like structure and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. The species is relatively rare and is often found in habitats with high humidity and moderate temperatures."
