    "intro": "Dryopteris meridionalis, commonly known as the southern wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It features a robust rhizome system that supports its growth in moist, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, compound leaves that are divided into narrow, serrated segments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to woodland gardens."
