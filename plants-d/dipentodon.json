    "intro": "Dipentodon, commonly known as the stone pine, is a genus of evergreen trees belonging to the family Pinaceae. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure, typical of coniferous plants. The genus includes several species, such as Dipentodon macrocarpus, which is native to Southeast Asia. These trees can grow quite tall, often reaching heights of up to 30 meters, and are valued for their ornamental and ecological significance. Their cones contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to their role in forest ecosystems."
