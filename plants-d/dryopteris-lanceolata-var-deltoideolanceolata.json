    "intro": "Dryopteris lanceolata var. deltoideolanceolata, commonly known as the deltoid lanceleaf wood fern, is a variant of the lanceleaf wood fern native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, deltoid-shaped fronds that are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, lanceolate shape. The fronds are typically green and can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
