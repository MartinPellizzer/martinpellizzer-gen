    "intro": "Dactylis hispanica, commonly known as Spanish needle or goatweed, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in panicles. The plant produces tiny, barbed seeds that are easily dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny habitats. Dactylis hispanica is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in pastures."
