It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry roots that help anchor it in its habitat. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. This variety is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
