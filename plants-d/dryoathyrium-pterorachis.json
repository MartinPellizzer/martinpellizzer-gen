    "intro": "Dryoathyrium pterorachis, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome and produces small, fertile fronds with spore-producing structures called sori. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The botanical features of Dryoathyrium pterorachis make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecology."
