    "intro": "Dischidia dolichantha, commonly known as the long-stemmed air plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink. The plant is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in hanging baskets or as a climbing plant."
