    "intro": "Delphinium decorum var. gracilentum, commonly known as the slender larkspur, is a striking perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of cobalt-blue to violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain poisonous alkaloids."
