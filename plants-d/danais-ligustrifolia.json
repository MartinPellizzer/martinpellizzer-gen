    "intro": "Danais ligustrifolia, commonly known as the white-flowered danais, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting well to moist, well-drained soils. Danais ligustrifolia is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
