    "intro": "Draba glabella var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-seeded whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a small, mat-forming perennial with hairy, fleshy leaves that help it survive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by short, rounded seed pods. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, compact inflorescences, and it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. This variety is distinguished by its shorter seed capsules compared to other forms of Draba glabella."
