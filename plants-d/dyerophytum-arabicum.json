    "intro": "Dyerophytum arabicum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and distinctive yellow-orange flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, hard seeds. Dyerophytum arabicum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant landscaping."
