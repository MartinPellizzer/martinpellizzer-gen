    "intro": "Draba lasiocarpa var. bosniaca, commonly known as the Bosnian rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pungent aroma. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are basal, lobed, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas."
