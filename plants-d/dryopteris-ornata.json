It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are adorned with golden to brown spore cases along the margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments, creating a distinctive, elegant appearance. Dryopteris ornata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in partial to full shade."
