    "intro": "Danthonia angulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
