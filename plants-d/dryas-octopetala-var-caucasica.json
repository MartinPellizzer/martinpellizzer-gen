    "intro": "Dryas octopetala var. caucasica, commonly known as Caucasian dryas, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variety is adapted to rocky and alpine conditions, making it a hardy species found in high-altitude areas."
