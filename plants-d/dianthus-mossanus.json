    "intro": "Dianthus mossanus, commonly known as the mossy carnation, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other well-known species like carnations and pinks. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, moss-like coating, giving it its common name. Dianthus mossanus thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
