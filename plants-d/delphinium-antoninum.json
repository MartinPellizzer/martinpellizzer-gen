    "intro": "Delphinium antoninum, commonly known as Antonin's larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring tall, unbranched stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Delphinium antoninum is valued in gardens for its vibrant blooms and is also noted for its ecological importance to pollinators."
