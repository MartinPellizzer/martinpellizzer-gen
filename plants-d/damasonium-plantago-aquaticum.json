    "intro": "Damasonium plantago-aquaticum, commonly known as water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow water, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in spikes and are pollinated by insects. The plant is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality in aquatic ecosystems."
