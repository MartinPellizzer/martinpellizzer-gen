    "intro": "Dubautia laevigata, commonly known as the smooth Dubautia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. Dubautia laevigata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mesic habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
