    "intro": "Doronicum laevifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leaved leopard's bane, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth, slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers with dark purple centers, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Doronicum laevifolium is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
