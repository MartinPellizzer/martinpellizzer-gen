It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, elliptic leaves with slightly toothed margins. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in racemes, followed by edible, dark purple to black berries. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
