    "intro": "Doraena, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that seem to shimmer in the sunlight, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically between late autumn and early spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly serrated, adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, Doraena is highly sought after by botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
