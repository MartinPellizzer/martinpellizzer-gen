    "intro": "Digitaria pennata var. pilosa, commonly known as hairy digitaria, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it both a weed in agricultural settings and a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
