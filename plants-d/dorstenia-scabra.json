It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its fibrous, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces unique, spiral-shaped inflorescences that bear tiny, yellowish flowers. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
