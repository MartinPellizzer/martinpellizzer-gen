    "intro": "Dryopteris wolfii, commonly known as the Wolf's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, narrow, and elongated shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
