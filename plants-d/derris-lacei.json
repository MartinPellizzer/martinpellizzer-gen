It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their potential medicinal properties. Derris lacei is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its ecological role in humid forest ecosystems."
