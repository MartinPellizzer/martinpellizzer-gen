    "intro": "Delosperma repens, commonly known as ice plant, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange, typically blooming in spring and summer. It spreads rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Delosperma repens is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
