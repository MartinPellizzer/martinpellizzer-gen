    "intro": "Dendrobium huntianum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. Dendrobium huntianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ease of cultivation."
