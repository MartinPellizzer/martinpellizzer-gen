    "intro": "Dendrobium assamicum, commonly known as the Assam orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the northeastern regions of India. It is characterized by its erect, often branched stems that are covered with a thick layer of white to yellowish bark. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with rich organic soil. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
