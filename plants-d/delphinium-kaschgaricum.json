    "intro": "Delphinium kaschgaricum, commonly known as the Karakorum larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in raceme clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. Due to its habitat in high-altitude environments, it is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
