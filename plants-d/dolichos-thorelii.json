It produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is adapted to poor soil conditions. Dolichos thorelii is valued for its nutritional seeds and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
