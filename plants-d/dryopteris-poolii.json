    "intro": "Dryopteris poolii, commonly known as the Pool's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas with well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris poolii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
