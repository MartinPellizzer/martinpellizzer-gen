    "intro": "Dicliptera grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered dicliptera, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth surface and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its flowering period usually occurs during the wet season, attracting various pollinators. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense ground covers in its natural habitat."
