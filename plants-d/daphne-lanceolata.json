    "intro": "Daphne lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Daphne lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden landscapes for its seasonal interest."
