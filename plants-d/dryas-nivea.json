    "intro": "Dryas nivea, commonly known as the snow buttercup, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its white, cup-shaped flowers and silver-green foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and conserve heat in cold environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in conditions of low temperatures and high UV exposure. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Dryas nivea plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization."
