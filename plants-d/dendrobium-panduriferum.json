    "intro": "Dendrobium panduriferum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium panduriferum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil for optimal growth."
