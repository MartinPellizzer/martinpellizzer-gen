    "intro": "Danthonia collina, commonly known as narrowleaf hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that produce dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes more pronounced in the summer months. Danthonia collina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
