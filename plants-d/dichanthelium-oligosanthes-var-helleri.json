    "intro": "Dichanthelium oligosanthes var. helleri, commonly known as Heller's false brome, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and roadside ditches. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and taxonomic research."
