    "intro": "Diplazium bonincola, commonly known as the Bonin cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the Bonin Islands. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant grows in rocky, coastal habitats, often on cliffs or steep slopes where it can anchor itself in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the fern family. Diplazium bonincola is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray, making it a hardy plant in its native environment."
