    "intro": "Dendrobium bigibbum var. albomarginatum, commonly known as the white-margin orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with numerous pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with distinctive white margins on the petals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
