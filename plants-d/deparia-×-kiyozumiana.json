    "intro": "Deparia \u00d7 kiyozumiana, commonly known as the Japanese forest fern, is a hybrid species within the Dryopteris genus. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that exhibit a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands and forest floors. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
