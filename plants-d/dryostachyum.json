    "intro": "Dryostachyum, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a genus of grasses native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. These plants are characterized by their tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. Dryostachyum species are typically perennial, with rhizomatous growth habits that allow them to form dense mats or clumps. They prefer well-drained soils and are often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its architectural form and drought tolerance."
