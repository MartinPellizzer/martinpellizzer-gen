    "intro": "Dendrobium roseoflavidum, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Dendrobium roseoflavidum is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
