    "intro": "Disporum sessile f. minus, commonly known as the lesser sessile disporum, is a rare variant of the disporum genus native to the western United States. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered white flowers. The foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically evergreen. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
