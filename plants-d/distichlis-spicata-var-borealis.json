    "intro": "Distichlis spicata var. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic glasswheat, is a perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal and tundra soils and providing habitat for arctic wildlife."
