    "intro": "Dendrobium appendiculoides, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid that grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant features long, cane-like stems with clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to yellow and orange. Its flowers are typically borne in racemes and bloom during the warmer months. Dendrobium appendiculoides is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
