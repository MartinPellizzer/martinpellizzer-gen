    "intro": "Digitaria basaltica, commonly known as basalt grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
