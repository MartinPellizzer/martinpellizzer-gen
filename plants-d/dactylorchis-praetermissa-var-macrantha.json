    "intro": "Dactylorchis praetermissa var. macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, grass-like foliage and its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, with each flower having three petals and three sepals that are often adorned with intricate markings. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
