    "intro": "Dischidia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fig. It is a climbing or trailing plant native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and aerial roots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically hidden among the foliage. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Dischidia angustifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its trailing growth habit."
