    "intro": "Deyeuxia fiebrigii, commonly known as the narrowleaf false panic grass, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and marshy areas. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and rhizomes that help it spread vegetatively. Deyeuxia fiebrigii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
