    "intro": "Dalbergia verrucosa, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to central and southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a fine grain. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by flat, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its high value for furniture and musical instruments, it is also a species of concern for conservation."
