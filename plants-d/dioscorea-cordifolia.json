It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and cylindrical, tuberous roots that are often used in traditional medicine. Its growth habit involves twining around supports, and it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The tubers of Dioscorea cordifolia are sometimes cultivated for their nutritional value and medicinal properties."
