    "intro": "Dryopteris xiangxinensis, commonly known as the Xiangxinensh mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
