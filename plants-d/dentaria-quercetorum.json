    "intro": "Dentaria quercetorum, commonly known as the oakleaf dentaria, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, toothed leaves that resemble oak leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Dentaria quercetorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and providing habitat for various insects."
