    "intro": "Diplotaxis saharensis, commonly known as the Saharan mustard, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many mustard species, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its resilience, it is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability."
