    "intro": "Diplachne domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
