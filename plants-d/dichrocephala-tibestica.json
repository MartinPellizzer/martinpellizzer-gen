    "intro": "Dichrocephala tibestica, commonly known as the Tibesti dichrocephala, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Tibesti Mountains in Chad. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow, with ray florets that may change color depending on light exposure, giving it its common name. Dichrocephala tibestica is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it an important component of the local flora."
