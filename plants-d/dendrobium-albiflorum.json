    "intro": "Dendrobium albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its stems are typically cane-like and can grow up to several feet in length. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
