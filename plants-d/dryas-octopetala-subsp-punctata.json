    "intro": "Dryas octopetala subsp. punctata, commonly known as the punctate mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically basal, rounded, and covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, cold environments and often grows in rocky or gravelly soils. It plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various invertebrates and small mammals."
