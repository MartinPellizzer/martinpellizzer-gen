    "intro": "Darwinia fascicularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Darwinia, is an evergreen shrub native to south-eastern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Darwinia fascicularis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract native pollinators."
