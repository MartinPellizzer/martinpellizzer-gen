It consists of several species that are typically found in alpine and arctic regions, thriving in cold, rocky environments. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and small, clustered flowers that often have five petals. Donnellia species are known for their ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions, making them resilient inhabitants of high-altitude ecosystems. Their botanical features make them important components of mountain flora and subjects of study in ecological and botanical research."
