It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with silver or white on the underside. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. Its evergreen foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, especially in shaded areas. The plant is also noted for its slow growth and adaptability to moist, well-drained soils."
