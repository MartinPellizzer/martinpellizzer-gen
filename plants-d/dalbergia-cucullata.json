    "intro": "Dalbergia cucullata, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces pods that contain flat, dark brown seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich color, making it a sought-after material in woodworking. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as critically endangered."
