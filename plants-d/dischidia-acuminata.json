    "intro": "Dischidia acuminata, commonly known as the warty fig or climbing dischidia, is a tropical vine belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered with small, warty bumps. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers, followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid environments. Dischidia acuminata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
