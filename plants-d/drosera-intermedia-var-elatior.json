    "intro": "Drosera intermedia var. elatior, commonly known as the tall common sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems with small, white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in wet, boggy environments and requires consistent moisture and acidic soil. This variant is notable for its increased height compared to the standard Drosera intermedia."
