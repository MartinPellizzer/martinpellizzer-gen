    "intro": "Drypis spinosa subsp. linneana, commonly known as the Linnean drypis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
