    "intro": "Draba borealis var. arctoborealis, commonly known as the Arctic draba, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its compact rosette of basal leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single cluster at the top of the stem. The species is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season, relying on rapid growth and reproduction to survive in harsh environments."
