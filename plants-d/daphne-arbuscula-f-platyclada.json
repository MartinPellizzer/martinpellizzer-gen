    "intro": "Daphne arbuscula f. platyclada, commonly known as the flat-leaf daphne, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are broader and flatter than those of the typical species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during late winter to early spring. Its foliage remains dense and glossy throughout the year, making it an attractive ornamental plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established."
