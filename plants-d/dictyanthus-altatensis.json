    "intro": "Dictyanthus altatensis, commonly known as the highland bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude ecosystems and its potential role in local biodiversity."
