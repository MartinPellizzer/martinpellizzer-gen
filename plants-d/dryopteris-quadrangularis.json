    "intro": "Dryopteris quadrangularis, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. Native to East Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fronds are typically leathery and have a quadrangular cross-section, giving the plant its scientific name. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
