    "intro": "Dyckia hassleri var. montana, commonly known as the Montana Dyckia, is a bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a powdery coating. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
