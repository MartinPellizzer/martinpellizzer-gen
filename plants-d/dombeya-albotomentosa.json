It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular, leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Dombeya albotomentosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
