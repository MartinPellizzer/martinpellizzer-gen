    "intro": "Dichrostachys dumetaria, commonly known as the small-leaved burr legume, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant bears small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. Dichrostachys dumetaria is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
