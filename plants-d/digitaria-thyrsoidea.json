    "intro": "Digitaria thyrsoidea, commonly known as silverhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, silver-haired inflorescence and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are wind-pollinated. Digitaria thyrsoidea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
