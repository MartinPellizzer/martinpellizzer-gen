    "intro": "Dalea verbenacea var. sericea, commonly known as silky prairie clover, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has finely hairy foliage, which gives it a silvery appearance, and its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in native plant gardens."
