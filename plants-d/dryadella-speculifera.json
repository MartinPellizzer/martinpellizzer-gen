    "intro": "Dryadella speculifera, commonly known as the silverleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It forms a thin, leathery crust on tree bark, rocks, and soil, often appearing as a silvery-gray or pale greenish layer. The plant's structure consists of a fungal matrix interspersed with algae or cyanobacteria, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is particularly sensitive to air pollution, making it an indicator species for environmental health. Due to its delicate nature, it is rarely found in urban areas but is common in undisturbed forest ecosystems."
