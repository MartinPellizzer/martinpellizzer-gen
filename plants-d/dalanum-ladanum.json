    "intro": "Dalanum ladanum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Dalanum ladanum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
