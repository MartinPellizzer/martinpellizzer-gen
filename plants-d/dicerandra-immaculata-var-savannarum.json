    "intro": "Dicerandra immaculata var. savannarum, commonly known as the Florida dicerandra, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy, well-drained soils in open, sunny habitats such as scrublands and pine flatwoods. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is known for its medicinal properties, including use in traditional herbal remedies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
