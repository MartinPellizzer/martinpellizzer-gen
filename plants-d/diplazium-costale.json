    "intro": "Diplazium costale, commonly known as the veined brake, is a fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are divided into two rows of pinnae, giving it a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered along the margins of the pinnae. Diplazium costale is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in various regions across Asia and Africa."
