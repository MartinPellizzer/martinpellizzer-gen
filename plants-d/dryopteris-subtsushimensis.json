    "intro": "Dryopteris subtsushimensis, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are typically divided into segments with a serrated edge."
