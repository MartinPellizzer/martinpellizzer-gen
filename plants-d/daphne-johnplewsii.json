    "intro": "Daphne johnplewsii, commonly known as the Johnplews' daphne, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant has elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Daphne johnplewsii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
