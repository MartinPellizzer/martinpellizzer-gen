    "intro": "Dendrobium aporoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and captivating epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking white or pale green flowers and its unique, leafless appearance, which gives it its ethereal reputation. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer, and are known for their delicate, waxy texture. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Dendrobium aporoides is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
