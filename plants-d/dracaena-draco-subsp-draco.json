    "intro": "Dracaena draco subsp. draco, commonly known as the dragon tree, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a thick, woody trunk that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with dense, dark green, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its sap, known as dragon's blood, is a deep red resin used historically in medicine and dyes. The plant is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
