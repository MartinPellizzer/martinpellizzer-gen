    "intro": "Delphinium pseudocandelabrum, commonly known as the slender larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, supporting clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant produces small, spurred flowers that are typically arranged in dense, terminal spikes, a feature common among the Delphinium genus. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Delphinium pseudocandelabrum is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
