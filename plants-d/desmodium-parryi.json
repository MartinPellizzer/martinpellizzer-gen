It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Desmodium parryi is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
