It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact, branching structure with clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in its natural habitat. Dendrobium taiwanianum blooms during the winter months, adding a unique ornamental value to its environment."
