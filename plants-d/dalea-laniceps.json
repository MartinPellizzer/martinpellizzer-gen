    "intro": "Dalea laniceps, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of pink to purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Dalea laniceps plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
