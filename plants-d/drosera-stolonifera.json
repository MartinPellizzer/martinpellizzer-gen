    "intro": "Drosera stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and produces small, sticky glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically covered in red or orange-colored glands that secrete a mucilaginous substance. It thrives in wet, acidic environments and is often found in marshy or boggy areas. Drosera stolonifera reproduces through both sexual means and vegetative propagation via stolons."
