    "intro": "Delphinium apiculatum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers with spurred petals, which are typical features of the Delphinium genus. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Delphinium apiculatum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens."
