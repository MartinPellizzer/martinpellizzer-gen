    "intro": "Discocactus heptacanthus var. semicampaniflorus, commonly known as the seven-spined discocactus, is a unique cactus species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed stem that develops a flattened, disc-like shape as it matures. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
