    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 prochazkana, commonly known as the Prochazkana marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale to dark purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and requires consistently moist conditions to thrive. It has a complex root system that includes both rhizomes and mycorrhizal associations, which aid in nutrient uptake. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
