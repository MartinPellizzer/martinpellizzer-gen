    "intro": "Diospyros benghalensis, commonly known as Indian persimmon, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange to red berries. Its fruits are edible, though they are typically consumed when fully ripe, and the tree is valued for its wood, which is hard and durable. Diospyros benghalensis is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
