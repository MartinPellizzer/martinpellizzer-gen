    "intro": "Dryopteris bangii, commonly known as the Bangii wood fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Dryopteris bangii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
