    "intro": "Delphinium pentagynum var. heterotrichum, commonly known as the heterotrichous delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, often with a bluish-green hue. This variety is notable for its distinct floral morphology, which sets it apart from other delphinium species."
