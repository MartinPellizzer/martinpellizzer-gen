    "intro": "Dryas octopetala var. minor, commonly known as the lesser white avens, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or barren habitats. Its leaves are typically basal, with a thick, leathery texture, and the stems are often prostrate or semi-upright. The species is adapted to cold climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value in rock gardens."
