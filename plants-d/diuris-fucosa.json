    "intro": "Diuris fucosa, commonly known as the black-leafed spider-orchid, is an Australian native orchid species characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance. It typically grows in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant features elongated, dark green leaves and produces striking, pale green or cream-colored flowers with intricate patterns. Diuris fucosa is a perennial herb that blooms during the cooler months, usually between July and October. Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
