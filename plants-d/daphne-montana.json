    "intro": "Daphne montana, commonly known as the mountain daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in late spring, typically in shades of pink, white, and red. Its leaves are dark green and elliptical, providing an attractive evergreen appearance in winter. Daphne montana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in cooler climates."
