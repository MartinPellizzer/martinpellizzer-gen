    "intro": "Draba frigida var. ramosa, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to cold, alpine environments. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, dark green leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers during the short growing season of summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Draba frigida var. ramosa plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing food for herbivores and supporting local biodiversity."
