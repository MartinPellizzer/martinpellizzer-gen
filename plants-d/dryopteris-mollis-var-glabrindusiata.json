    "intro": "Dryopteris mollis var. glabrindusiata, commonly known as the silky fern, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a delicate, almost silky appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
