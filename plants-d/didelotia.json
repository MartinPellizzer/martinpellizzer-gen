    "intro": "Didelotia, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It consists of several species, predominantly found in southern Africa, with a few extending into tropical regions of Asia. The plants are characterized by their large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Didelotia species typically have hairy stems and leaves, and their flowers often emit a strong, sweet fragrance. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
