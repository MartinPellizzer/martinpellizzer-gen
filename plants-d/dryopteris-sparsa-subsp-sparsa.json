    "intro": "Dryopteris sparsa subsp. sparsa, commonly known as the sparse fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread gradually across forest floors. Its leaves are bipinnate, with closely spaced, narrow pinnae that give it a finely textured appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
