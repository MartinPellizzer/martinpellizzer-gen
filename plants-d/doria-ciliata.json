    "intro": "Doria ciliata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by elliptical, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Doria ciliata is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
