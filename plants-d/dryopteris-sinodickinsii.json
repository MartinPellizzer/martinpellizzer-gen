    "intro": "Dryopteris sinodickinsii, commonly known as the Chinese wood fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fiddleheads emerging in the spring and unfurling throughout the growing season."
