    "intro": "Dendromyza salomonia, commonly known as the Salomonia tree, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has a woody stem with a smooth, grayish bark that becomes more textured with age. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss, Dendromyza salomonia is now classified as an endangered species."
