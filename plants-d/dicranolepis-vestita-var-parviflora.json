    "intro": "Dicranolepis vestita var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered velvet fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, silky-hairy fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that are clustered along the stems, contributing to its unique ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or clay-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
