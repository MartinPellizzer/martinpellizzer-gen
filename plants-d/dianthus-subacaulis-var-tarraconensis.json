It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant features small, pink or red flowers that bloom in early spring, typically on slender stems. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, adapting to its harsh, dry habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
