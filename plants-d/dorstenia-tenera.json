    "intro": "Dorstenia tenera, commonly known as the velvetleaf or forest star, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Dorstenia tenera is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental foliage. Its growth habit and unique leaf structure make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
