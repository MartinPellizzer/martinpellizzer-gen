    "intro": "Diosma strumosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, purple-blue flowers. The plant is known for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in construction and furniture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in some regions."
