    "intro": "Dorstenia poinsettiifolia var. glabrescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf strobilanthes, is a unique member of the Moraceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its striking, velvety, and often colorful leaves. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with a fibrous root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are usually large, heart-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs. While it does not produce showy flowers, it is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
