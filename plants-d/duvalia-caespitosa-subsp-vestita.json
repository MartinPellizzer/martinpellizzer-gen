    "intro": "Duvalia caespitosa subsp. vestita, commonly known as the velvet duvalia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
