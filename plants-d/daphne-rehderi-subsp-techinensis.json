    "intro": "Daphne rehderi subsp. techinensis, commonly known as the Ethiopian daphne, is a rare and endemic species native to Ethiopia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and distinctive, fragrant flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine, white pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
