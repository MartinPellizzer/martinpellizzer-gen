    "intro": "Dipteracanthus repens, commonly known as the creeping dipteracanthus, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or swampy areas."
