    "intro": "Daphne oleoides subsp. kurdica, commonly known as Kurdish spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features compact, evergreen foliage with glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant for rock gardens and borders. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
