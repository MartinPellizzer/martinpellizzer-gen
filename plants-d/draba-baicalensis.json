    "intro": "Draba baicalensis, commonly known as the Baikal Draba, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, particularly in Russia and Mongolia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces delicate white or pale yellow flowers during the late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in its harsh habitat. Draba baicalensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
