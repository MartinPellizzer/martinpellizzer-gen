    "intro": "Dimeria ornithopoda subvar. microchaeta, commonly known as the small-hair dimeria, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible seeds. The subvariety is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. This plant is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, drought-prone habitats."
