    "intro": "Dichopsis pustulata, commonly known as the swollen bulbous cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in small, white, waxy tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, lateral branches. Its ability to store water in its stems makes it well adapted to arid environments. Dichopsis pustulata is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
