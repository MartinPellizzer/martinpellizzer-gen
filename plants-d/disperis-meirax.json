    "intro": "Disperis meirax, commonly known as the Meirax orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
