    "intro": "Diplazium stipitipinnula, commonly known as the slender-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water bodies. Its rhizomes are short and produce a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
