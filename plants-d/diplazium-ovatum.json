    "intro": "Diplazium ovatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, ovate-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of its fronds, typical of many fern species."
