    "intro": "Delphinium spurium, commonly known as the slender larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. Delphinium spurium is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
