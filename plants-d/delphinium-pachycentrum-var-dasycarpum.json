    "intro": "Delphinium pachycentrum var. dasycarpum, commonly known as the dense-fruited delphinium, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant features palmate leaves with a velvety texture, and its unique variation, dasycarpum, is distinguished by its dense, hairy fruiting structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
