    "intro": "Diospyros virginiana var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive orange to reddish-orange fruit that is typically larger than the typical species. The fruit has a thick, leathery skin and is edible when fully ripe, containing a sweet, mealy pulp. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in bottomlands."
