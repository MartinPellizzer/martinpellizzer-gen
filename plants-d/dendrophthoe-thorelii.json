    "intro": "Dendrophthoe thorelii, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant forms a dense, spherical growth that can weigh several kilograms, often leading to the weakening or death of the host tree. Its berries are small, red, and contain toxic compounds, making them unpalatable to most animals. Dendrophthoe thorelii is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested areas where its host trees thrive."
