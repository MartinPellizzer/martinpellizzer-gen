    "intro": "Dryopteris lobata, commonly known as the lady fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically arching and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing sporangia are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds."
