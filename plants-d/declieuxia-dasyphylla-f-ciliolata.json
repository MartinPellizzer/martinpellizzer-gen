    "intro": "Declieuxia dasyphylla f. ciliolata, commonly known as the ciliate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, triangular leaves with finely ciliate margins, giving it its specific epithet. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of tiny, three-lobed flowers. This variant is particularly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
