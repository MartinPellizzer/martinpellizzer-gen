    "intro": "Dryopteris tonduzii, commonly known as the Tonduz's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that sets it apart from other Dryopteris species. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the margins of the fronds, a common feature among many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
