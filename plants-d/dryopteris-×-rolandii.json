    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 rolandii, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a hybrid fern that results from the cross between Dryopteris affinis and Dryopteris carpathica. It is characterized by its lush, bright green fronds that often display a golden or yellowish hue on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. It has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive success in suitable habitats."
