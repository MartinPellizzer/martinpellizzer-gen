It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by long, slender pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant is valued for its forage potential and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
