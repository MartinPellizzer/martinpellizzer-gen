    "intro": "Dryopteris azorica, commonly known as the Azorean wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Azores, an archipelago in the North Atlantic. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are distinguishable by their darker coloration. The Azorean wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
