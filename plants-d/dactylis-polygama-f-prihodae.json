    "intro": "Dactylis polygama f. prihodae, commonly known as the Prihodae's dactylis, is a botanical variant of the genus Dactylis, characterized by its unique morphological traits. It is a perennial grass species native to specific regions of Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin. The plant exhibits a tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and pastures. Its genetic distinctiveness makes it an important subject in studies of plant taxonomy and evolutionary botany."
