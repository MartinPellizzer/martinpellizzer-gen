    "intro": "Dendropanax tessmannii, commonly known as the Tasmanian devil plant, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the southeastern regions of Australia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by black, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
