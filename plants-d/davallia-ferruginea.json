    "intro": "Davallia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, clumping growth habit and dark green fronds with a rusty-colored underside. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Davallia ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
