It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Davilla strigosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
