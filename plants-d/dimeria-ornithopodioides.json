It is a small, perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in spring and are often arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water in its native dry environment. Dimeria ornithopodioides is well-suited to rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
