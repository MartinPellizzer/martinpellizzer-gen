    "intro": "Doryopteris lonchophora, commonly known as the long-veined shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are bi-lobed and have long, parallel veins that give the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in both wild and cultivated settings."
