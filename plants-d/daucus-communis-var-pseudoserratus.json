    "intro": "Daucus communis var. pseudoserratus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wild carrot, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, and appear in umbrella-like clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a dry, ridged schizocarp that splits into two parts when mature, dispersing seeds by wind."
