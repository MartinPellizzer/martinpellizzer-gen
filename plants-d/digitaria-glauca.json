    "intro": "Digitaria glauca, commonly known as bluegrass panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Digitaria glauca is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas."
