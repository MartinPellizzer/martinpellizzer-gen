    "intro": "Drymonia tenuis, commonly known as the slender drymonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and swamps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
