    "intro": "Dichrocephala, commonly known as the two-headed plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive two-headed inflorescence, which consists of two different types of flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in wetland or marshy environments. Dichrocephala species have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often arranged in a compact cluster. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
