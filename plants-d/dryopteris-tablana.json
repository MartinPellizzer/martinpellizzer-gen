    "intro": "Dryopteris tablana, commonly known as the Tablan fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
