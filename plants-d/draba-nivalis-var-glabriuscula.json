    "intro": "Draba nivalis var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the glabrous snowweed, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other varieties of Draba nivalis. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variant is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
