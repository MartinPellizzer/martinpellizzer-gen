    "intro": "Diemisa rosea, commonly known as the pink sandalwood, is a rare and striking plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late winter or early spring. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with slender, branching stems covered in fine, silvery hairs. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Diemisa rosea is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
