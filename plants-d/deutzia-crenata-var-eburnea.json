    "intro": "Deutzia crenata var. eburnea, commonly known as silver lace deutzia, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its finely cut, white to pale green leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are often followed by red or purple berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its compact growth habit and seasonal interest make it a versatile addition to landscape designs."
