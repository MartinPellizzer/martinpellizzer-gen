    "intro": "Dryopteris jiangshanensis, commonly known as the Jiangshan shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a shield-shaped structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with rich soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
