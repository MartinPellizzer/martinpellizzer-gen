It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring tall, spindly stems covered in dense, soft hairs. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are compound, with elongated, serrated leaflets that are arranged alternately along the stem. Delphinium liangshanense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties."
