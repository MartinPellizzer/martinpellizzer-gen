    "intro": "Dendrobium subelobatum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cane-like stems that often bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in summer, producing white or pale yellow flowers with intricate, lip-shaped petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium subelobatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
