It exhibits a dual life cycle, transitioning between vegetative and reproductive phases in response to environmental cues. The plant's botanical features include a fibrous root system and lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Its flowers, which appear in clusters, are small and inconspicuous, typically blooming in late spring."
