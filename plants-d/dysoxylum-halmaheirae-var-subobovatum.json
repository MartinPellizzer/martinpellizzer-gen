    "intro": "Dysoxylum halmaheirae var. subobovatum, commonly known as the narrow-ovate dysoxylum, is a tropical tree species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
