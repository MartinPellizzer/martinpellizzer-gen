    "intro": "Dinochloa sipitangensis, commonly known as the Sipitang grass, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Malaysia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface, while its inflorescence consists of spikelets that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
