It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, and its small, yellowish flowers are borne in dense clusters. It has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soils and dry conditions. Desmodium rufihirsutum is also known for its potential use in soil nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria."
