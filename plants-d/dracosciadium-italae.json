    "intro": "Dracosciadium italae, commonly known as the Italian dragon's blood plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its striking red, gelatinous seeds that resemble dried blood. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its unique seed structure has led to its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
