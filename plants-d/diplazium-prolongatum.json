    "intro": "Diplazium prolongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Diplazium prolongatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
