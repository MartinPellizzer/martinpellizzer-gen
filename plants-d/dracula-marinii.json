    "intro": "Dracula marinii, commonly known as the \"Marin's vampire orchid,\" is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its dark, velvety petals that resemble the appearance of a vampire's face, giving it its dramatic common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are typically violet or purple in color and emit a faint fragrance. Dracula marinii is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and challenging cultivation requirements."
