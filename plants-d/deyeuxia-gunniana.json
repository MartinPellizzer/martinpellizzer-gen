    "intro": "Deyeuxia gunniana, commonly known as the mountain couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern and eastern Africa. It typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, often forming dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to cool, temperate climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Deyeuxia gunniana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native range."
