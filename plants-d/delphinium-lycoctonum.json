    "intro": "Delphinium lycoctonum, commonly known as the meadow larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in raceme inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture, and its root system consists of thick, fleshy rhizomes. Delphinium lycoctonum is noted for its ornamental value in gardens but is also toxic to livestock and humans due to the presence of alkaloids."
