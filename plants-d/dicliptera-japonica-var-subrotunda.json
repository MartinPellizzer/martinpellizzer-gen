    "intro": "Dicliptera japonica var. subrotunda, commonly known as Japanese sedge or Japanese sedges, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, three-angled berries. This variety is distinguished by its slightly rounded leaf bases, which give it its specific epithet *subrotunda*."
