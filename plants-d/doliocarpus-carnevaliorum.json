    "intro": "Doliocarpus carnevaliorum, commonly known as the Carnevali's doliocarpus, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its fruit is a follicle that contains several seeds, and it plays a minor role in local ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
