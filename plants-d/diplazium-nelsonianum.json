It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into lobes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds.
