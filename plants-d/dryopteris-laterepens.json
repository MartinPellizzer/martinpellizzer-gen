    "intro": "Dryopteris laterepens, commonly known as the rusty shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are often covered in a rusty-colored bloom, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually over time. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
