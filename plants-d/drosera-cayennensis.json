    "intro": "Drosera cayennensis, commonly known as the Cayenne sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sweet-smelling nectar to lure and trap insect prey. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, wet environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are usually small and rosette-shaped, with the glands concentrated along the leaf surface. Drosera cayennensis is known for its ability to digest captured insects, providing it with essential nutrients in its harsh habitat."
