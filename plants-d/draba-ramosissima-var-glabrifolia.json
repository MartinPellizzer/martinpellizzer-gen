    "intro": "Draba ramosissima var. glabrifolia, commonly known as the glabrous sandwort, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of slender, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is characterized by its reduced leaf pubescence, distinguishing it from other varieties of Draba ramosissima."
