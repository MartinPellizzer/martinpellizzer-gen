    "intro": "Dolicholus balansae, commonly known as the Balansae dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its lack of leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its slender, thread-like stems allow it to attach to various host plants, often causing significant damage to agricultural crops. Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in some regions and poses challenges for crop management."
