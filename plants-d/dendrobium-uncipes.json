    "intro": "Dendrobium uncipes, commonly known as the orchid with the unique floral structure, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a pseudobulb system that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to cream-colored flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Dendrobium uncipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
