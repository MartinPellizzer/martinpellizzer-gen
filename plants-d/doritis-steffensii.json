    "intro": "Doritis steffensii, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique appearance, featuring a single, fleshy stem and a cluster of pale, ghostly white flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often growing near water sources. Its flowers are small and delicate, typically blooming in late summer or early autumn. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Doritis steffensii is considered a vulnerable species."
