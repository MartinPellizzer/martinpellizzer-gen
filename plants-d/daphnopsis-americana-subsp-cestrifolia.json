    "intro": "Daphnopsis americana subsp. cestrifolia, commonly known as the creeping daphnopsis, is a member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodland understories. This subspecies is notable for its horticultural value and ability to form dense ground cover in suitable conditions."
