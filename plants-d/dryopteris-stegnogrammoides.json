    "intro": "Dryopteris stegnogrammoides, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the Dryopteris genus. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like China, India, and Myanmar. The plant features a dense, leathery frond with a distinctive shield-like shape, which gives it its common name. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies in shaded, moist environments. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing a lush green appearance throughout the year."
