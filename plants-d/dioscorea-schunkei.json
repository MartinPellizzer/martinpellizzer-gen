    "intro": "Dioscorea schunkei, commonly known as Schunk's yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, green, heart-shaped leaves and bears yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits. Its tubers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits, though they contain toxic compounds that require careful preparation."
