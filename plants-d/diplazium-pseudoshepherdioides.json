It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Diplazium pseudoshepherdioides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
