    "intro": "Dryopteris caeca, commonly known as the barren wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically unbranched and have a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. Dryopteris caeca is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
