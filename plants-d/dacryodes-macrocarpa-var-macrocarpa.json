    "intro": "Dacryodes macrocarpa var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the African snow apple, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and simple, alternate leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that are yellow to orange in color. Its fruit is edible, though often used in traditional medicine, and the tree is valued for its hard, durable wood. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks."
