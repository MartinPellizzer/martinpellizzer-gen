    "intro": "Dendrobium maguanense, commonly known as the Maguanense orchid, is a species of orchid native to China, particularly in the Yunnan province. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium maguanense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
