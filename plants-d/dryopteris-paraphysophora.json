    "intro": "Dryopteris paraphysophora, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a species of polypody fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
