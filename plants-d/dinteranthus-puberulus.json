It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its dry habitat. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
