    "intro": "Dicksonia sparmanniana, commonly known as the Sparrmann's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of fertile fronds that bear spores, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and enabling it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. This species is often found in forest understories, where it plays a role in maintaining ecological balance."
