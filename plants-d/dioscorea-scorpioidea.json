It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, serpentine-shaped leaves that resemble a scorpion's tail. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by tuberous roots that are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth habit and unique foliage make it a notable species in botanical studies and horticulture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
