    "intro": "Diasperus heterodoxus, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with hairy, blue-green leaves. It produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the spurge family. Diasperus heterodoxus is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and a capacity to store water in its succulent stems."
