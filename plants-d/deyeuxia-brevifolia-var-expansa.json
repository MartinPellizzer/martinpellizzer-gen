    "intro": "Deyeuxia brevifolia var. expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually flat and slightly broader than the typical variety of Deyeuxia brevifolia. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers. This variant is notable for its distinctive leaf morphology and ecological adaptability in moist environments."
