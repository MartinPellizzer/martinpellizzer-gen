    "intro": "Digitaria tenuispica, commonly known as slender digitgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open areas, such as fields and disturbed soils, and is often found in the Americas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Digitaria tenuispica is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its invasive growth habits."
