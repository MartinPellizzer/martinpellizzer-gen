    "intro": "Dryopteris hypophlebia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
