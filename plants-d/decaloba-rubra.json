    "intro": "Decaloba rubra, commonly known as the red-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white in color, arranged in clustered inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of rare orchids."
