    "intro": "Danthonia borussica, commonly known as the slender field grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
