    "intro": "Deyeuxia sylvatica var. inaequata, commonly known as the unequal sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is often used in wetland restoration projects."
