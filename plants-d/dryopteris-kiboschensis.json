    "intro": "Dryopteris kiboschensis, commonly known as the Kibosch fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central Africa. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
