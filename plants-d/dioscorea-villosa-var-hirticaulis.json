    "intro": "Dioscorea villosa var. hirticaulis, commonly known as wild yam, is a perennial vine native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically alternate along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by tuberous roots that are used in traditional medicine. These tubers are also a source of diosgenin, a compound used in the synthesis of hormonal medications. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
