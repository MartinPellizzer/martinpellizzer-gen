    "intro": "Dennstaedtia cicutaria var. cornuta, commonly known as the horned water fern, is a variant of the water fern native to wetland and marsh habitats. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that often bear spore-bearing structures called sporangia. The plant thrives in shallow, still water and is often found in temperate regions. Its fronds are typically divided into smaller, finger-like segments, giving it a lacy appearance. This fern plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
