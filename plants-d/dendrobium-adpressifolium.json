    "intro": "Dendrobium adpressifolium, commonly known as the flat-leaf dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can reach several feet in length. Its leaves are flat and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Dendrobium adpressifolium blooms with clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months."
