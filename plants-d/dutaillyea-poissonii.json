    "intro": "Dutaillyea poissonii, commonly known as the Poisson's Dutaillyea, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to the island of R\u00e9union in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in rocky or coastal areas. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited study, much about its ecological role and reproductive habits remains undocumented."
