    "intro": "Draba pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean whitlowgrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and the Pyrenees. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Draba pyrenaica is an herbaceous perennial that produces a basal rosette of leaves and has a short, flowering stem. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous environment."
