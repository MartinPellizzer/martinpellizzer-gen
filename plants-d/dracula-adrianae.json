    "intro": "Dracula adrianae, commonly known as the Adriana's vampire orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark, velvety petals that resemble a vampire's cloak. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
