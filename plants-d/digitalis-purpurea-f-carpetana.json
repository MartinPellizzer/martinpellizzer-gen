    "intro": "Digitalis purpurea f. carpetana, commonly known as the purple foxglove, is a striking perennial plant native to the British Isles. It features tall, spires of bell-shaped flowers that range from deep purple to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The foliage consists of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It is also noted for its historical use in medicine, though it contains toxic cardiac glycosides."
