    "intro": "Draba cuzcoensis, commonly known as the Cuzco sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of southern Peru. It is a small, herbaceous species that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments. The plant has basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, and its flowers are small, white to pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences. Draba cuzcoensis is adapted to cold, arid conditions and is often found at elevations above 4,000 meters. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
