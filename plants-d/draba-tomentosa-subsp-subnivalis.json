    "intro": "Draba tomentosa subsp. subnivalis, commonly known as the snowdrift whitlow, is a flowering plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy, compact foliage that helps insulate it against cold temperatures. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically blooming before the snow has fully melted. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high altitudes. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species, often requiring specific environmental conditions to survive."
