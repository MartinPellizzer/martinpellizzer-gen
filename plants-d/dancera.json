It is characterized by its striking, fiery red flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has palmately compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and it can grow as a tree or shrub depending on the species. Dancera thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and public landscapes."
