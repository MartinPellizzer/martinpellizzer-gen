    "intro": "Dryopteris intermedia f. concordiana, commonly known as the Concordiana Shield Fern, is a varietal form of the shield fern, characterized by its distinctive, broad, and leathery fronds. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly thriving in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's fronds are typically dark green and have a slightly curled appearance, with a robust, upright growth habit. It is a perennial herb that reproduces through spores, and its rhizomes contribute to its ability to spread and form dense colonies. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
