It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the late afternoon and close by morning. The plant produces spiny, egg-shaped fruits that contain numerous seeds. Datura praecox is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
