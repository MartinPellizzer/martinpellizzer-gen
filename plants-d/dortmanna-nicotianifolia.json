    "intro": "Dortmanna nicotianifolia, commonly known as the tobacco-leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive appearance with a greenish-gray thallus and a leathery texture. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
