    "intro": "Draba deserticola, commonly known as the desert sandcress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a small, annual or biennial plant with a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with four petals, and bloom in early spring. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. This plant is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations."
