    "intro": "Dorstenia caudata, commonly known as the curly willow or whipstick, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, serpentine stems that coil and twist, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a faint fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dorstenia caudata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking visual appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
