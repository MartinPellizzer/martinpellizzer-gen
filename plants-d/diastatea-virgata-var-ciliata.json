    "intro": "Diastatea virgata var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy leaf fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical significance lies in its morphology and ecological role. The varietal name *ciliata* refers to the ciliated margins of its leaves, a key identifying feature."
