    "intro": "Dianella sparsiflora, commonly known as the slender flax lily, is a striking evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in summer, which are followed by blue berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Dianella sparsiflora is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps."
