    "intro": "Dryopteris laoshanensis, commonly known as the Laoshan shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into numerous pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in groups called sorus. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
