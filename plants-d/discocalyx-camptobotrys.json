    "intro": "Discocalyx camptobotrys, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern characterized by its floating fronds. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it in shallow water, with fronds that spread out to form a dense, floating mat. Its leaves are typically broad and have a distinctive, slightly curled margin. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
