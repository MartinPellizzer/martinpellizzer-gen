    "intro": "Drynaria iteophylla, commonly known as the tree fern, is a member of the Drynariaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its fronds are typically evergreen, providing year-round foliage. Drynaria iteophylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant form and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
