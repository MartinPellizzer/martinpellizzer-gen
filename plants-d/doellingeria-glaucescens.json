    "intro": "Doellingeria glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green sedge, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a bluish-green hue, giving it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. Doellingeria glaucescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
