    "intro": "Dortmanna bicalcarata, commonly known as the two-ribbed liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its flattened, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and photosynthetic. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, called archegonia, are located on the underside of the thallus. Dortmanna bicalcarata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
