    "intro": "Dianthus kremeri, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and clusters of pink or white flowers with prominent, showy petals. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Dianthus kremeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
