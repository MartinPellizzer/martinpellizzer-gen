    "intro": "Ditassa foldatsii, commonly known as the Foldats' dittany, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous roots. The plant is notable for its small, yellowish flowers and its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists. Its botanical study contributes to understanding the adaptive strategies of alpine flora."
