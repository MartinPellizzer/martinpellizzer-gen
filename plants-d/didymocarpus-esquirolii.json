    "intro": "Didymocarpus esquirolii, commonly known as the Kew's wax tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels. The plant is notable for its unique, waxy, red or orange fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
