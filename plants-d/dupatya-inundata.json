    "intro": "Dupatya inundata, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, floating fronds that are usually divided into small, lance-shaped segments. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, helping to stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Dupatya inundata plays a role in water filtration and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
