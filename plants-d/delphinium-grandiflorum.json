    "intro": "Delphinium grandiflorum, commonly known as the larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, topped with dense clusters of blue, purple, or white flowers. The flowers are spurred at the base, a distinctive feature that gives the plant its scientific name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, often with a rough texture. Delphinium grandiflorum prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and alpine gardens."
