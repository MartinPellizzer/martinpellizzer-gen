    "intro": "Dendrobium theionochilum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive golden hue, which bloom during the dry season. It has long, wiry stems that can store water, aiding its survival in arid environments. The leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss and thrive in its natural habitat."
