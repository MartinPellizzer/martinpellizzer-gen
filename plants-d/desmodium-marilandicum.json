    "intro": "Desmodium marilandicum, commonly known as Carolina brier, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It has trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria, enriching the soil. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover and a valuable plant for erosion control."
