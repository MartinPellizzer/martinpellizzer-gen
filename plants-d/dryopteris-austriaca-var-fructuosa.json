    "intro": "Dryopteris austriaca var. fructuosa, commonly known as the Austrian wood fern, is a variant of the European wood fern native to central and southeastern Europe. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features fronds that are pinnate, with a distinctive, upright growth habit and a dark green coloration. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
