    "intro": "Dulichium arundinaceum var. boreale, commonly known as northern reed, is a perennial grass species native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often used as reeds, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
