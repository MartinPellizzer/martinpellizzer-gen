    "intro": "Draba matangensis, commonly known as the Matangens mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops and weeds. The plant is characterized by its small, basal rosette of leaves and produces clusters of tiny white or yellow flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
