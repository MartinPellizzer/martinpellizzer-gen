    "intro": "Deparia petersenii subsp. congrua, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile fronds in the second."
