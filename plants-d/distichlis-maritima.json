    "intro": "Distichlis maritima, commonly known as saltgrass, is a halophyte native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, such as salt marshes and dunes, due to its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Distichlis maritima plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
