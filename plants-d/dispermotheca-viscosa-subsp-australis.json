    "intro": "Dispermotheca viscosa subsp. australis, commonly known as the sticky dispermotheca, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its sticky surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the dry and sometimes harsh conditions of its native habitat."
