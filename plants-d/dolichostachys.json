    "intro": "Dolichostachys, commonly known as the long-stemmed grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. These plants are characterized by their tall, slender stems and narrow leaves, often growing in tropical and subtropical regions. Dolichostachys species typically produce panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. They are adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making them common in open habitats. Due to their ornamental value and ecological importance, some species are cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
