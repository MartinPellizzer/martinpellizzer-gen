    "intro": "Dipsacus fullonum var. comosus, commonly known as the common teasel, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of purple to brown bracts that resemble a crown, which are used in traditional crafts and historically for making cloth. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in waste areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
