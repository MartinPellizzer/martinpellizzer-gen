    "intro": "Dalbergia bequaertii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces hard, dark timber that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
