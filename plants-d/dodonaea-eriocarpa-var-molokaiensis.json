    "intro": "Dodonaea eriocarpa var. molokaiensis, commonly known as Molokai Dodonaea, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in coastal and dry woodland habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
