    "intro": "Davallia retusa, commonly known as the serrate huperzia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, evergreen leaves that are deeply serrated along the margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
