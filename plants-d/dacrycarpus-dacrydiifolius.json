    "intro": "Dacrycarpus dacrydiifolius, commonly known as the silver pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are often silver-white in color due to a waxy coating. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in coastal and lowland forest environments, often forming dense stands. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and historical significance in M\u0101ori culture."
