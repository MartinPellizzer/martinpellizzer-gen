    "intro": "Dendrobium chrysographatum, commonly known as the golden-veined orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like stems and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with distinctive golden veins. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for climbing or epiphytic growth on trees. Dendrobium chrysographatum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
