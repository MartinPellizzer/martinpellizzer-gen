It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It blooms during the warmer months, typically from spring to early summer. Drosanthemum duplessiae is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
