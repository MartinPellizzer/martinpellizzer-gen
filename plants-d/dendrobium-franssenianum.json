    "intro": "Dendrobium franssenianum, commonly known as the Franssen's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid genera. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Dendrobium franssenianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
