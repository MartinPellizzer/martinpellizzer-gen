    "intro": "Dryopteris pallida subsp. balearica, commonly known as the Balearic lady fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to the Balearic Islands. It is characterized by its finely divided, pale green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
