    "intro": "Dolichos pruriens, commonly known as the cowpea or velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its climbing habit, trifoliate leaves, and distinctive yellow flowers. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain edible seeds, which are rich in protein and used in various cuisines. Its seeds also contain alkaloids, which can have medicinal properties but are toxic in high doses. Dolichos pruriens is often cultivated for both its nutritional value and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
