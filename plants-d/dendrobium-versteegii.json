    "intro": "Dendrobium versteegii, commonly known as the Versteeg's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, cane-like growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms during the dry season, which is an adaptation to its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in environments with irregular rainfall. Dendrobium versteegii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
