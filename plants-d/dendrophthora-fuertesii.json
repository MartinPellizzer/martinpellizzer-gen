    "intro": "Dendrophthora fuertesii, commonly known as the Fuertes' mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white, fleshy berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is native to parts of Central America and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ecological role includes providing food for birds and insects, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
