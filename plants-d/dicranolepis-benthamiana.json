It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, forming dense clusters. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Dicranolepis benthamiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical botanical gardens."
