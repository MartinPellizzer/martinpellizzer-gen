    "intro": "Digitaria gallaensis, commonly known as the Galician digitaria, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
