    "intro": "Drosera rosulata, commonly known as the Rosulate Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern, with numerous hair-like structures called tentacles that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically covered in red-tipped glands that aid in attracting and digesting prey. It thrives in moist, acidic environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique appearance and predatory nature, it is a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
