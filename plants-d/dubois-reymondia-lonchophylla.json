    "intro": "Dubois-reymondia lonchophylla, commonly known as the spiky leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often spiky leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
