    "intro": "Drymophila, commonly known as the dwarf heather, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ericaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their evergreen leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. Drymophila species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe, Asia, and North America. They thrive in acidic, well-drained soils and are often found in mountainous or woodland areas. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to form dense, attractive groundcovers."
