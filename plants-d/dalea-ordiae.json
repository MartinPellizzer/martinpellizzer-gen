    "intro": "Dalea ordiae, commonly known as the Ord's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Dalea ordiae is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, which benefits surrounding vegetation. It is often found in the Great Basin and adjacent regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
