    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 shibipedis, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid fern that results from the cross between Dryopteris japonica and Dryopteris affinis. It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and shaded landscapes."
