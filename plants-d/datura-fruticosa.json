    "intro": "Datura fruticosa, commonly known as the angel's trumpet, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, and it produces a distinctive, showy inflorescence. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it a common sight in desert landscapes. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a rough texture, and it has a strong, often unpleasant odor. Datura fruticosa contains toxic alkaloids, which make it dangerous to both animals and humans if ingested."
