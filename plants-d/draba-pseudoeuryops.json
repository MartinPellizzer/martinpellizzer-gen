    "intro": "Draba pseudoeuryops, commonly known as the false broadleafed whitlow, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Draba pseudoeuryops produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, contributing to its role in pollinator support in high-altitude ecosystems."
