    "intro": "Didymopanax calvus, commonly known as the smooth-leafed banyan, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbellate inflorescences, followed by berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The tree is notable for its ability to form aerial roots, which can eventually reach the ground and support the plant as a buttressed tree."
