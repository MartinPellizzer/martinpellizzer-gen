    "intro": "Digitaria sanguinalis var. multinervis, commonly known as the hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its fibrous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a common weed and a resilient forage plant."
