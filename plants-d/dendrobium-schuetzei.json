    "intro": "Dendrobium schuetzei, commonly known as the Schuetze's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom during the wet season. Dendrobium schuetzei is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions."
