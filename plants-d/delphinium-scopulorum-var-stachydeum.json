    "intro": "Delphinium scopulorum var. stachydeum, commonly known as the Alpine larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in racemes along the stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments."
