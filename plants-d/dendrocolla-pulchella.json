    "intro": "Dendrocolla pulchella, commonly known as the beautiful tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a unique ability to form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aids in nutrient absorption. Its fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a rare trait among ferns. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
