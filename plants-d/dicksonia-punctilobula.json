    "intro": "Dicksonia punctilobula, commonly known as the serrated tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that are distinctly serrated. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its fronds can grow up to 3 meters in length, contributing to its dramatic appearance. Dicksonia punctilobula plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various native animals."
