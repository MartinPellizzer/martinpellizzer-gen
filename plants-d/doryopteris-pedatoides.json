    "intro": "Doryopteris pedatoides, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to the Americas. It is characterized by its floating, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Doryopteris pedatoides plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic ecosystems."
