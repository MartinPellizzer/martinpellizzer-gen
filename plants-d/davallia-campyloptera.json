    "intro": "Davallia campyloptera, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, horizontal stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its leaves are usually leathery and dark green, with a serrated or lobed margin. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest undergrowth."
