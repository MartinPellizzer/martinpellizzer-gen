    "intro": "Daviesia virgata, commonly known as the pink-flowered daviesia, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking pink or red flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Daviesia virgata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
