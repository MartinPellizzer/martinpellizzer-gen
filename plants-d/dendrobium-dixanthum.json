    "intro": "Dendrobium dixanthum, commonly known as the yellow-lipped orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers with distinctive red lips. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in conservation programs."
