    "intro": "Dipodium roseum, commonly known as the pink fern, is a striking ornamental plant characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. Native to tropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with consistently moist soil. The plant features small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Its foliage displays a unique pinkish hue, especially when young, adding a soft, ethereal appearance to gardens. Due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
