    "intro": "Damapana welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia mirabilis, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia. It is one of the oldest living seed plant species, with a lineage dating back over 140 million years. The plant is characterized by its two large, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 4 meters in length. It also has a thick, woody trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in the arid environment. Its ability to thrive in extreme conditions makes it a remarkable example of adaptation in desert ecosystems."
