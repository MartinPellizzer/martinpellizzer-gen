    "intro": "Dendrobium kiamfeeanum, commonly known as the Kiamfeean orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, pendant-like inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or white in color. Its leaves are long and strap-like, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in its natural habitat. Dendrobium kiamfeeanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its delicate floral display."
