    "intro": "Draba lactea f. glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the glabrata form lacks these hairs, giving it a smoother appearance. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. The species is notable for its ability to survive in harsh, cold climates due to its compact growth habit and frost-resistant foliage."
