It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in racemose inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated margins, and it prefers well-drained, rocky soils. Delphinium kansuense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, although it contains toxic alkaloids."
