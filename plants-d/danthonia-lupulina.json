    "intro": "Danthonia lupulina, commonly known as the purple grass or slender danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and forms dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green hue. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets, and it is primarily wind-pollinated."
