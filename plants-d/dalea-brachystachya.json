    "intro": "Dalea brachystachya, commonly known as the short-stalked milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Dalea brachystachya plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
