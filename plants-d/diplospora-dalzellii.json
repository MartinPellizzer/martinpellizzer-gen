    "intro": "Diplospora dalzellii, commonly known as the Dalzell's diplospora, is a rare and intriguing member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with small, leathery leaves that have a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a delicate ornamental value. Its fruits are small, dark berries that contain seeds with a unique morphology. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
