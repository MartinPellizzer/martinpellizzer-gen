    "intro": "Deyeuxia rigida, commonly known as rigid false rice, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Deyeuxia rigida plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
