    "intro": "Dalibarda geoides, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northeastern United States. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in early spring. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats in moist, shaded habitats. Dalibarda geoides is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
