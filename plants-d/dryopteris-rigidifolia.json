    "intro": "Dryopteris rigidifolia, commonly known as the hard fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright, rigid fronds that are often deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in damp, nutrient-rich soils. Dryopteris rigidifolia is known for its ornamental value and is often used in horticulture for its attractive, feathery foliage."
