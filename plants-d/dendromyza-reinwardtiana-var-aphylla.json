    "intro": "Dendromyza reinwardtiana var. aphylla, commonly known as the leafless banyan, is a variant of the banyan tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves on the aerial roots, which distinguish it from other banyan species. The plant has a large, sprawling canopy supported by numerous prop roots that descend from its main trunk. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in the axils of the branches. This variant is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ability to create dense shade in tropical environments."
