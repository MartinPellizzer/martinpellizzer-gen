    "intro": "Dacryodes peruviana var. caroniensis, commonly known as the Caronensis ironwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, lowland tropical forests and is often found in secondary growth areas. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
