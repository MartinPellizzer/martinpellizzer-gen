    "intro": "Dendrobium muscicola, commonly known as the moss orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique growth habit, with stems that often grow close to the ground and covered in a dense layer of moss-like growth. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
