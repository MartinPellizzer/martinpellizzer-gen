    "intro": "Diplazium petrii, commonly known as the broadleaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive, broad, and often serrated shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting pollinators."
