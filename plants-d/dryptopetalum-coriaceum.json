    "intro": "Dryptopetalum coriaceum, commonly known as the thick-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or purple. The leaves are thick and leathery, which helps the plant retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. The plant's unique morphology and adaptive features make it a notable species in its native ecosystem."
