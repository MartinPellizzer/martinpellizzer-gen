    "intro": "Didissandra serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated sandstone plant, is a unique species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its root system is adapted to anchor it in rocky soils, and it is often found growing on sandstone outcrops. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
