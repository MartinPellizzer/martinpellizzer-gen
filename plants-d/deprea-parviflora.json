    "intro": "Deprea parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered deprea, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact growth habit with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
