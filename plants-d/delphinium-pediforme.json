    "intro": "Delphinium pediforme, commonly known as the creeping larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features tall, unbranched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with blue to purple flowers arranged in dense spikes. The plant has lance-shaped, basal leaves that are often hairy and can grow up to 20 centimeters in length. Its flowers are characterized by their spurred petals, which are a key feature of the delphinium genus. Delphinium pediforme is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
