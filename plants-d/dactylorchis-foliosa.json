    "intro": "Dactylorchis foliosa, commonly known as the leafy twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial orchid characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and delicate, pale greenish-yellow flowers. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a short, fleshy rhizome and produces tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its woodland habitat, with reduced leaves and specialized root systems for nutrient absorption."
