It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
