    "intro": "Dryopteris sheareri, commonly known as the Shear's wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, arching shape and serrated leaflets. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
