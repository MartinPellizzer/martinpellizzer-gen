    "intro": "Diploblechnum fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are divided into small, serrated segments, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
