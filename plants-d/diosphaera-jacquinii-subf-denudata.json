It is characterized by its small, simple leaves and unique floral structures. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent stems. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female parts, a common feature in the Euphorbiaceae family. The subshrub is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xerophytic landscapes."
