    "intro": "Diasperus frondosus, commonly known as the fronded spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its stems are often branched and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Diasperus frondosus is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
