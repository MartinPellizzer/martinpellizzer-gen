    "intro": "Diplopappus cornifolius, commonly known as the horned goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, sharply toothed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its fruit is a two-part capsule that releases seeds when mature, aiding in its dispersal. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
