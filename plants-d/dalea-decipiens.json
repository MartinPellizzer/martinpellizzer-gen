    "intro": "Dalea decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive dalea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Dalea decipiens plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
