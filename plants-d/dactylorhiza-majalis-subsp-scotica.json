    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis subsp. scotica, commonly known as the Scottish marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Scottish Highlands and parts of northern England. It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems that bear small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, calcareous habitats such as peat bogs and damp grasslands. Its roots are specialized for mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for nutrient uptake. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller stature and narrower leaves compared to other Dactylorhiza species."
