    "intro": "Dendrobium hillii, commonly known as the Hill's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive, intricate pattern on the petals and sepals. Dendrobium hillii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
