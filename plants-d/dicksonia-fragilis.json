    "intro": "Dicksonia fragilis, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 5 meters. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores on the underside of its fronds rather than flowers. Its trunk is composed of a central vascular cylinder surrounded by layers of dead, fibrous tissue. Dicksonia fragilis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
