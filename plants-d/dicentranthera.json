    "intro": "Dicentranthera, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display a vibrant yellow or golden color. The plants are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or other structures without being parasitic. Dicentranthera species are native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. Their intricate floral structures and ecological adaptations make them a subject of interest in botanical research and horticulture."
