    "intro": "Dryopteris wurunuran, commonly known as the Wurunuran shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical rainforests of Australia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into several segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in dense undergrowth. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. The Wurunuran shield fern plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
