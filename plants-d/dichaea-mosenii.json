    "intro": "Dichaea mosenii, commonly known as the Mosenii air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that collect and store water. The plant produces small, colorful inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water absorption and protection from intense sunlight. Dichaea mosenii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
