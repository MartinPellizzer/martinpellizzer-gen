    "intro": "Dryopteris ruiziana, commonly known as the Ruiz's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to two meters in length, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
