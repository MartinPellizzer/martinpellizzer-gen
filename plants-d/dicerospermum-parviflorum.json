    "intro": "Dicerospermum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered dicerospermum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and mango trees. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and palm-like leaves. It typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
