    "intro": "Dockrillia wassellii, commonly known as the Wessel's dockrillia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
