    "intro": "Diplazium repandum, commonly known as the common button fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce erect, branched fronds. The fronds are typically bi-pinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental foliage and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
