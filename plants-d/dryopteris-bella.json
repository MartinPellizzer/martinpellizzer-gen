    "intro": "Dryopteris bella, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-drained soil. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies over time. Dryopteris bella is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
