    "intro": "Delphinium neowentsaii, commonly known as the Neowentsaii larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
