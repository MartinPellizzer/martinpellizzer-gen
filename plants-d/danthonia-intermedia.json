    "intro": "Danthonia intermedia, commonly known as the common danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides. Danthonia intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
