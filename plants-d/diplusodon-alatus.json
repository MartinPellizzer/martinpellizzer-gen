    "intro": "Diplusodon alatus, commonly known as the winged lichen, is a unique lichen species that exhibits a distinctive botanical structure. It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its foliose thallus with a leathery texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which contributes to its growth and survival in various environments. Its morphology includes a central axis with lateral branches, giving it a branching, tree-like appearance. Diplusodon alatus is often found on rock surfaces in temperate regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling."
