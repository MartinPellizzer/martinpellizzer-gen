    "intro": "Desmodium pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest clover, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. This characteristic makes it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
