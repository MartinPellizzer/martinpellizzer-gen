    "intro": "Daemonorops intermedia, commonly known as the cycad tree or the sago palm, is a member of the cycad family (Zamiaceae). It is a tropical plant characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines, and thrives in humid, warm climates. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
