    "intro": "Diplazium mutabile, commonly known as the variable fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are bipinnate and often have a distinctive, variable appearance. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. The plant's adaptability and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
