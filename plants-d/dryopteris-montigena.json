    "intro": "Dryopteris montigena, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in rocky or shaded forest areas. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor firmly in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give the plant a lush, feathery appearance."
