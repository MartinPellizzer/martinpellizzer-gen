    "intro": "Danthoniopsis multinodis, commonly known as the nodding danthoniopsis, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to South Africa. It features slender, wiry stems that often curl upward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to blue-green spikelets that are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to full sun conditions. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
