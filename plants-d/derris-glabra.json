    "intro": "Derris glabra, commonly known as the white spurge, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers, which are often hidden within a fleshy, green cupular structure called a cyathium. Derris glabra is known for its latex sap, which contains toxic compounds and is used in traditional medicine. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats."
