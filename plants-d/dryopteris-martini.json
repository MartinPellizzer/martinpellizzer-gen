    "intro": "Dryopteris martini, commonly known as the Martini wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and wiry, supporting the growth of its foliage. The fronds are usually dark green and have a rugged texture, making it a striking addition to woodland gardens."
