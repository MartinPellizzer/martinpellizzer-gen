    "intro": "Delphinium pseudograndiflorum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, adorned with large, showy blue to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, with a rough texture due to the presence of glandular hairs. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense spikes, and the plant is known for its striking appearance and ornamental value in gardens. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens and rockeries."
