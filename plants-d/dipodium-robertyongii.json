    "intro": "Dipodium robertyongii, commonly known as the Robert's dipodium, is a rare fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dipodium robertyongii is considered a species of conservation concern."
