    "intro": "Dryopteris genuflexa, commonly known as the bent frond wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, drooping fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors, preferring rich, well-drained soils. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Dryopteris genuflexa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to woodland gardens."
