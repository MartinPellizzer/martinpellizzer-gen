    "intro": "Doryopteris deltoidea, commonly known as the delta fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, triangular-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, feather-like segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for propagation. Doryopteris deltoidea plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms."
