    "intro": "Digitaria obtusa, commonly known as broadleaf signalgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Digitaria obtusa is notable for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural settings."
