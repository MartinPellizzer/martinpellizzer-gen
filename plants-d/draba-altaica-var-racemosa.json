    "intro": "Draba altaica var. racemosa, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. It produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
