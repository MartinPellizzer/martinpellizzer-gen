It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, hard seeds. Diastema tenerrimum is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
