    "intro": "Dipterocarpus rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leaf dipterocarp, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and heavy, aromatic wood. The plant is often found in lowland rainforests and plays a significant role in the ecological structure of these habitats. It produces small, yellowish flowers and is pollinated by insects, with its fruits developing into woody capsules that release seeds. This species is also valued for its timber and has been traditionally used in local construction and crafts."
