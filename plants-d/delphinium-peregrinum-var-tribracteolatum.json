The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowers are typically arranged in dense, terminal spikes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
