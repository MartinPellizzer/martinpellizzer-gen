    "intro": "Dactyloides, commonly known as prickly pear cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. It is characterized by its spine-covered stems and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is native to the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. It has adapted to survive in harsh environments through its succulent stems, which store water. Dactyloides species are also known for their edible fruits, which are often used in culinary and medicinal applications."
