    "intro": "Diplazium bicuspe, commonly known as the two-spined shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The fronds are bipinnate, with pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
