It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture. Dichoglottis muralis is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
