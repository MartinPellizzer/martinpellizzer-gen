    "intro": "Dieffenbachia \u00d7 splendens, commonly known as the Leopard Plant or Snake Plant, is a hybrid houseplant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, oval-shaped leaves with striking white and green variegation. The plant is a member of the Araceae family, which includes plants with a spadix and spathe structure. It thrives in low to moderate light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is toxic if ingested, making it important to keep it away from pets and children."
