    "intro": "Dendrobium nieuwenhuisii, commonly known as the Nieuwenhuis's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with numerous fragrant, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and serve as storage organs for water and nutrients. Dendrobium nieuwenhuisii prefers bright, indirect light and is relatively easy to care for in a suitable tropical environment."
