It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically small, yellow, and clustered in axillary inflorescences. The plant produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Dolichos axilliflorus is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and potential use in agricultural systems."
