    "intro": "Dracaena terniflora var. thwaitesii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dracaena, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow, dark green leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow streaks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
