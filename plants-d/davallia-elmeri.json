    "intro": "Davallia elmeri, commonly known as the Elmer's hartioglossum, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green and finely divided. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in small, round structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Davallia elmeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
