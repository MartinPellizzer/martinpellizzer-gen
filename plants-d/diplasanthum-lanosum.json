    "intro": "Diplasanthum lanosum, commonly known as the woolly diplasanthum, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The woolly texture of its leaves is a distinctive botanical feature that aids in moisture retention and protection from herbivores."
