    "intro": "Dipterostele, commonly known as the \"two-stemmed\" plant, is a unique type of vascular plant structure found in certain ferns and their relatives. It consists of two distinct vascular systems: an outer phloem and an inner xylem, which are separated by a layer of parenchyma cells. This arrangement allows for efficient transport of water and nutrients throughout the plant. The dipterostele is a key feature in the evolution of more complex vascular systems in plants. It is most commonly observed in the order Cyatheales, which includes tree ferns."
