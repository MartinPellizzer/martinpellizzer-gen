    "intro": "Dryopteris hobdyana, commonly known as Hobdy's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a soft, feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
