    "intro": "Draba cemileae, commonly known as the Cemile's rockcress, is a flowering plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are often lobed. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically blooming before the snow has fully melted. Draba cemileae is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes and gravelly soils."
