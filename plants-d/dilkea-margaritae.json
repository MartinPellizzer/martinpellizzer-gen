    "intro": "Dilkea margaritae, commonly known as the Margarita Dilkea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has finely divided, grass-like leaves. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, producing a subtle white or pale yellow color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dilkea margaritae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
