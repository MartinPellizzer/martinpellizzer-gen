    "intro": "Daphne lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a soft, woolly texture. Daphne lanuginosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
