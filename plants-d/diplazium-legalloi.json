    "intro": "Diplazium legalloi, commonly known as the golden chain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that often form a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor the plant while spreading vegetatively. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, tropical climates."
