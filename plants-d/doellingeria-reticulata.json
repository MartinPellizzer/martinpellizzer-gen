    "intro": "Doellingeria reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often floating or submersed, with a distinctive net-like vein pattern on the underside. Its small, white flowers appear in late summer and are arranged in a spike-like cluster. Doellingeria reticulata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and waterfowl."
