It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, with five petals that may be pink, red, or white. Diploclisia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. They are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and flowering habits."
