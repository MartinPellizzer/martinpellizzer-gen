    "intro": "Dryopteris decomposita var. glabella, commonly known as the glabrous wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated fronds that are typically shorter and more compact compared to the typical variety. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and have a smooth, glabrous surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
