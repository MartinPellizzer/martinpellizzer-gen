    "intro": "Dactylis woronowii, commonly known as woolly cocksfoot, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Dactylis woronowii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in some regions for forage and erosion control."
