    "intro": "Dianthus gerundensis, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and vibrant pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Dianthus gerundensis is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
