    "intro": "Decateles, commonly known as the \"false indigo\" or \"Mexican blueweed,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plants are characterized by their showy, blue or purple flower clusters that bloom in spring or early summer. Decateles species typically have compound leaves and produce small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. These plants are often used in ornamental gardening due to their attractive appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
