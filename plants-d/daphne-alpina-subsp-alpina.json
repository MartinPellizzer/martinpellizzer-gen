    "intro": "Daphne alpina subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine daphne, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, compact foliage composed of dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, typically appearing in late winter or early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with cold climates."
