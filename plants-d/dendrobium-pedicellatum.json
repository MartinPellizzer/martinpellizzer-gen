    "intro": "Dendrobium pedicellatum, commonly known as the orchid with clustered flowers, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems that grow horizontally and produce clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in variable environmental conditions. The flowers are usually yellow or orange with red or purple markings, making it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation."
