    "intro": "Diospyros inhacaensis, commonly known as the Inhaca persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the island of Inhaca off the coast of Mozambique. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family, which includes ebony and persimmon trees. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, oval-shaped berry that turns from green to yellow when mature, and it is edible when fully ripe. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited commercial use due to its restricted geographic distribution."
