    "intro": "Duosperma eremophilum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows from 6 to 12 inches tall, featuring slender stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water. Duosperma eremophilum is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
