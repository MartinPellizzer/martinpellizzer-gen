    "intro": "Dryandra sclerophylla, commonly known as the dryandra leafless grevillea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native region. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
