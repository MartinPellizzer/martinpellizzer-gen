    "intro": "Dryopteris paraguayensis, commonly known as the Paraguay shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in specialized structures called sorus."
