    "intro": "Decaneuropsis philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its yellowish-green leaves and small, white flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria. It produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
