    "intro": "Diporidium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf lichen, is a small, crustose lichen that thrives on bare rock surfaces in arid environments. It has a pale green to yellowish coloration, with a dense, tightly packed thallus that helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients from the substrate. It is often found in regions with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure, such as deserts and rocky outcrops. Due to its small size and specialized habitat, it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for other organisms."
