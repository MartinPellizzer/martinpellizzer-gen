    "intro": "Dicorypha, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in southern Africa. They are characterized by their small, often clustered flowers and succulent leaves that help them conserve water. Dicorypha species are often shrubs or herbs, with some species growing as perennial plants. Their botanical features make them well-adapted to harsh, dry environments."
