    "intro": "Didymocheton setosus, commonly known as the hairy sago palm, is a member of the Arecaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of pinnately arranged, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spadices, followed by dark blue to black berries. Its leaves are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it the \"hairy\" descriptor in its common name. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
