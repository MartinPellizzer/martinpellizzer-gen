    "intro": "Douglasia laevigata var. ciliolata, commonly known as the ciliated douglasia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, ciliate (fringed) hairs, giving the plant its varietal name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
