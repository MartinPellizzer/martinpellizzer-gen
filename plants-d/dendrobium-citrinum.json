    "intro": "Dendrobium citrinum, commonly known as the citron orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, giving it its common name. Its pseudobulbs are segmented and covered in a dense layer of white or pale green velvety fur. Dendrobium citrinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
