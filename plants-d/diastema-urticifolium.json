    "intro": "Diastema urticifolium, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. These trichomes secrete a mild irritant, causing a stinging sensation when the plant is touched. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in umbels, which are pollinated by wind. Diastema urticifolium is an important plant in both ecological and historical contexts, having been used for various medicinal and practical purposes throughout history."
