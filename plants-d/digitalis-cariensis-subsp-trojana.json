    "intro": "Digitalis cariensis subsp. trojana, commonly known as the Trojan foxglove, is a rare and striking member of the Plantaginaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, this species thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
