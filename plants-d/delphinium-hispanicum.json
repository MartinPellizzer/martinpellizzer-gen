    "intro": "Delphinium hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in whorls along the stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, with a distinctive hairy texture. Delphinium hispanicum prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
