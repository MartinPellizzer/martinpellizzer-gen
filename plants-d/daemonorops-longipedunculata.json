    "intro": "Daemonorops longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-stalked cycad, is a member of the Arecaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces distinctive, cone-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
