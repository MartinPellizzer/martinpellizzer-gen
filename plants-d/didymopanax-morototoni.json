    "intro": "Didymopanax morototoni, commonly known as the giant arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a large shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant features palmate leaves with long, narrow segments that are often used in traditional medicine. Its roots are valued for their starchy properties, similar to those of arrowroot. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
