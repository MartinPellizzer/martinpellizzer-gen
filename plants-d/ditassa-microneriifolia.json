    "intro": "Ditassa microneriifolia, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to tropical regions. It features finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a soft, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies. Its leaves are usually a deep green, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
