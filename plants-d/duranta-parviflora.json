    "intro": "Duranta parviflora, commonly known as the littleflower trumpetvine, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale blue flowers that are tubular in shape, typical of the Verbenaceae family. These flowers are followed by blue or purple berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
