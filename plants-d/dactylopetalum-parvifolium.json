It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when mature. It is often found in forested areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
