    "intro": "Dalbergia iquitosensis, commonly known as Iquitos rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its beauty and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. It produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to its ecological importance and the demand for its wood, it is classified as endangered and is protected in several countries."
