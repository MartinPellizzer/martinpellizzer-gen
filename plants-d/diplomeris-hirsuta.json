    "intro": "Diplomeris hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy diplomeris, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to reduce water loss in arid environments. Diplomeris hirsuta produces small yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
