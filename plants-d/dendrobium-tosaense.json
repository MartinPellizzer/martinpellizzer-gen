    "intro": "Dendrobium tosaense, commonly known as the Tosa orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan. It is an epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks in humid, tropical climates. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs covered in dense, leathery leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow or green with a distinctive red or purple lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
