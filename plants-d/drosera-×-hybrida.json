    "intro": "Drosera \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the sundew hybrid, is a carnivorous plant that belongs to the Droseraceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Drosera binata and Drosera rotundifolia, combining traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden dew to trap insects. It typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its unique morphology and adaptive carnivorous behavior make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
