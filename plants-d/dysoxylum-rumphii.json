It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild.
