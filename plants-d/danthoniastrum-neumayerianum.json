    "intro": "Danthoniastrum neumayerianum, commonly known as the Neumayer's grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
