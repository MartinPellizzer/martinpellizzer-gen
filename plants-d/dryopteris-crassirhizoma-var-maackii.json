    "intro": "Dryopteris crassirhizoma var. maackii, commonly known as the Maack's sword fern, is a variant of the broad-rhizome wood fern. It is a perennial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant features large, lance-shaped fronds that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps over time. This variety is valued in horticulture for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
