    "intro": "Dortmanna mucronata, commonly known as the small-lobed liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a leafy, flattened body that is often covered in small, rounded lobes. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are borne on the thallus, and it relies on water for fertilization. Dortmanna mucronata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
