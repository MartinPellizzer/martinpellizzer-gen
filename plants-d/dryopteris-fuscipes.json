    "intro": "Dryopteris fuscipes, commonly known as the black-stemmed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, often rusty-colored stems and its lance-shaped, deeply divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands, where it thrives in rich, organic soils. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are typically arranged in a loose, feathery pattern. Dryopteris fuscipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
