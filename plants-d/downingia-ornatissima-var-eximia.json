    "intro": "Downingia ornatissima var. eximia, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada pincushion flower, is a delicate annual plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, alpine conditions of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species is considered vulnerable and is often found in conservation programs."
