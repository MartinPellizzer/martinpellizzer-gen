It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive pattern of veins. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or on rocky slopes. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora."
