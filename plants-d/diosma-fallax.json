    "intro": "Diosma fallax, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial vine characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and twining. Diosma fallax is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
