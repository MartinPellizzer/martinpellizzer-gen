    "intro": "Daviesia incrassata var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved daviesia, is a shrub native to south-eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract native pollinators."
