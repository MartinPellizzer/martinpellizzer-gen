    "intro": "Digitalis, commonly known as foxglove, is a genus of about 20 species of flowering plants in the family Plantaginaceae. These plants are characterized by their tall, erect stems and distinctive bell-shaped flowers that come in shades of purple, pink, and white. Native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa, Digitalis species are often found in woodland areas and meadows. The plant contains cardiac glycosides, which have been used in medicine to treat heart conditions. However, all parts of the plant are toxic and should be handled with care."
