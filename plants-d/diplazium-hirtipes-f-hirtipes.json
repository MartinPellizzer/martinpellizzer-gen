    "intro": "Diplazium hirtipes f. hirtipes, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds with a hairy texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this feature may vary among different forms."
