    "intro": "Dicranolepis laciniata, commonly known as the fringed rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky or wooded substrates. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a common feature among ferns. Dicranolepis laciniata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
