    "intro": "Drosera muscipula, commonly known as the sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sweet-smelling mucilage to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically rosette-shaped and covered in these adhesive structures. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Drosera muscipula is a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and fascinating trapping mechanism."
