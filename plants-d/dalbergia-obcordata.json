    "intro": "Dalbergia obcordata, commonly known as rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and acoustic properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often followed by elongated pods. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its slow growth and high demand, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
