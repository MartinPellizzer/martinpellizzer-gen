    "intro": "Dalea hypoglottidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It has small, compound leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits. Dalea hypoglottidea is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility in its native range."
