    "intro": "Draba martinsiana, commonly known as the Martins' whitlowgrass, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Draba martinsiana is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils."
