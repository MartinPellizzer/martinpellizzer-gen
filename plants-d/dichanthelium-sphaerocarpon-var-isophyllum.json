    "intro": "Dichanthelium sphaerocarpon var. isophyllum, commonly known as the narrowleaf panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant typically grows in wetland or moist soil environments, such as swamps and marshes. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are covered in short, fine hairs. The leaves are narrow and have a distinctive blue-green color, making it visually distinct from other grasses in its habitat."
