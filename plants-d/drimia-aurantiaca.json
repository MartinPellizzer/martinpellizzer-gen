    "intro": "Drimia aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange bulbous plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy bulbs that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright orange flowers during the summer months, which are typically tubular and arranged in inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Drimia aurantiaca is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and drought tolerance."
