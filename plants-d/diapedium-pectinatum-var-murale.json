    "intro": "Diapedium pectinatum var. murale, commonly known as the wall diapedium, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is well adapted to grow on rocky or shaded walls, where it can anchor itself using its aerial roots."
