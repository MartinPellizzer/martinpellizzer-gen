    "intro": "Dianthus absconditus, commonly known as the hidden carnation, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
