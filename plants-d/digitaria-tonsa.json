    "intro": "Digitaria tonsa, commonly known as slender bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of South America. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often blue-green in color. It is drought-tolerant and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Digitaria tonsa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
