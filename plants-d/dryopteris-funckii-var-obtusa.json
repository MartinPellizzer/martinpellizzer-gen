    "intro": "Dryopteris funckii var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that are typically broad and slightly curled at the tips. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This variety is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other varieties within the Dryopteris genus."
