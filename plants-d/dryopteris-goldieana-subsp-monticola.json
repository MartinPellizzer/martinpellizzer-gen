    "intro": "Dryopteris goldieana subsp. monticola, commonly known as the mountain wood fern, is a fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
