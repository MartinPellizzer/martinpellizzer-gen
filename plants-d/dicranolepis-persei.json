    "intro": "Dicranolepis persei, commonly known as the Persian rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on rock surfaces or tree trunks in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into small, linear segments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds. Dicranolepis persei is adapted to survive in harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water conservation mechanisms."
