    "intro": "Dissanthelium pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf grass or small-flowered grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with slender, wiry stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are often clustered in loose, open panicles. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it blend into its natural habitat. Dissanthelium pygmaeum is adapted to wetland and marsh environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
