    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 renzii, commonly known as the hybrid lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dactylorhiza lapponica and Dactylorhiza maculata. The plant produces tall, spike-like inflorescences with numerous small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a dense, trichasial pattern. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor habitats such as bogs and fens, often growing in dense colonies. The orchid has a rhizomatous root system and is adapted to cool, temperate climates."
