    "intro": "Davallia solida var. fejeensis, commonly known as the Fejeensis water fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and often curled or twisted. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistently moist soil to flourish. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or moist substrates. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
