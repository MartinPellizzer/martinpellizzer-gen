    "intro": "Dryopteris abrupta, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, wiry fronds that are often folded and have a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often growing on cliffs or in crevices where moisture is retained. Its rhizomes are short and stout, and it produces small, pale green to yellowish spore-bearing structures called soruses. Dryopteris abrupta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to challenging growing conditions."
