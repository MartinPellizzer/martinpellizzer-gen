    "intro": "Digitalis viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered foxglove, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features tall, erect stems that bear whorled, lance-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking bell-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which is a distinguishing feature from other Digitalis species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This species is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
