    "intro": "Dryopteris neopodophylla, commonly known as the New Zealand sword fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, lanceolate shape and a serrated margin."
