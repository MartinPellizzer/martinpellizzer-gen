    "intro": "Dryopteris petrophila, commonly known as the alpine wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. This plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky substrates. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
