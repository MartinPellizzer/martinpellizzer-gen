    "intro": "Dalbergia lacei, commonly known as the Vietnamese rosewood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The tree produces hard, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in its native range."
