    "intro": "Dryopteris guineensis, commonly known as the African wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other parts of the world for horticultural purposes."
