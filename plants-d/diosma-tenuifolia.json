It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and used in traditional medicine. Diosma tenuifolia is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
