It is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
