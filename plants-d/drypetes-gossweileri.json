    "intro": "Drypetes gossweileri, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its hard, heavy wood, it has been historically valued for its use in furniture and construction."
