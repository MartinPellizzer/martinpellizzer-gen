    "intro": "Dipterocarpus orbicularis, commonly known as the round-leaf dipterocarp, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, orbicular-shaped leaves and can grow up to 40 meters tall. The plant produces heavy, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common trait among dipterocarps. It thrives in humid, lowland rainforests and plays a significant role in the ecological structure of these ecosystems. Its wood is valued for its strength and durability, making it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
