    "intro": "Deckera racemosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, round, yellowish fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and durability, though it is also listed as an endangered species due to overharvesting. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas."
