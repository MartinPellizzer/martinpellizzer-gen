    "intro": "Dicliptera trianae, commonly known as the Tepui grass, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its erect, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found on tepuis, which are isolated table-top mountains. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
