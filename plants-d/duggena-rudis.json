    "intro": "Duggena rudis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-blue foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its salty, windy environment. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and cliffs. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Duggena rudis is a hardy perennial that is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in coastal ecosystems."
