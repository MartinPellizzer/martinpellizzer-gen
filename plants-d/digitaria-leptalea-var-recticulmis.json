    "intro": "Digitaria leptalea var. recticulmis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stargrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, thriving in areas with high humidity and saturated soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle with small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This species plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by stabilizing soil and providing food for various wildlife species."
