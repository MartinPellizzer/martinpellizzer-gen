It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Dichelachne procera is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it can form dense stands."
