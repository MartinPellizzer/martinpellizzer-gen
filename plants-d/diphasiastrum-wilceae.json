    "intro": "Diphasiastrum wilceae, commonly known as the Wilce's clubmoss, is a species of small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that form a cushion-like structure. Native to the moist, shaded environments of the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States, it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically located at the base of the foliage. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is considered a valuable indicator species for undisturbed forest ecosystems."
