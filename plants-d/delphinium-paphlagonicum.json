    "intro": "Delphinium paphlagonicum, commonly known as the Paphlagonian larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountains of Turkey. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers, which are characteristic of the delphinium genus. The plant has palmate leaves composed of several lobes, and it thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. It is often found in alpine or subalpine regions, where it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
