    "intro": "Dalea peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Dalea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or purple streak. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and are often hairy. Dalea peninsularis thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments."
