    "intro": "Dombeya tremula, commonly known as the trembling dombeya, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and clusters of fluffy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a fine layer of silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant flowers and delicate, fern-like foliage."
