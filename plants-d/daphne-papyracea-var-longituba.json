    "intro": "Daphne papyracea var. longituba, commonly known as the long-stemmed daphne, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in early spring. Its botanical name reflects its papery, delicate foliage, while the variety name alludes to its elongated stems. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and botanic collections."
