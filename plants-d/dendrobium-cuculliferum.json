    "intro": "Dendrobium cuculliferum, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to greenish-white, with a distinctive helmet-shaped lip. Dendrobium cuculliferum thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
