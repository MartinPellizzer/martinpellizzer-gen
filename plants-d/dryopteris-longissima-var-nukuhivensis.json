    "intro": "Dryopteris longissima var. nukuhivensis, commonly known as the Nukuhiva shield fern, is a variant of the long-leaf wood fern. It is native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a tall, upright rhizome with long, leathery, dark green fronds that can reach up to two meters in length. Its fronds are divided into lance-shaped pinnae, which are often curled and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
