    "intro": "Dendrobium beckleri var. racemosum, commonly known as the racemosum orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its leaves are usually linear and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted for efficient water retention. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
