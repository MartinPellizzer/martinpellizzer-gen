It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its attractive, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and orange. The plant is shrub-like, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often pubescent. It thrives in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, typically between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
