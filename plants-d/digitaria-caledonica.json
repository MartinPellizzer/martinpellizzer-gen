    "intro": "Digitaria caledonica, commonly known as the Caledonian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Scotland and other parts of the British Isles. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Digitaria caledonica plays an important ecological role in supporting local insect and bird populations in its native habitat."
