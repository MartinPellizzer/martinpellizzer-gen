    "intro": "Dryopteris diacalpe, commonly known as the Jamaican shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive shield-like structure on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the undersides."
