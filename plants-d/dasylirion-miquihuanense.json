    "intro": "Dasylirion miquihuanense, commonly known as the Miquihuanense sotol, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of stiff, blue-gray leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, white to pale purple flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall. Its structure and growth habits make it an important species in desert ecosystems."
