    "intro": "Dortmanna rhytidosperma, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The species is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
