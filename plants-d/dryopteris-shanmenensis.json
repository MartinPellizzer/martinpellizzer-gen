    "intro": "Dryopteris shanmenensis, commonly known as the Shanmen fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, acidic soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
