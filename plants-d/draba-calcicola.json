    "intro": "Draba calcicola, commonly known as the limestone draba, is a small flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. This species is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Draba calcicola thrives in calcareous soils, often found on rocky slopes and alpine meadows. Its ability to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments makes it an important indicator species for limestone habitats."
