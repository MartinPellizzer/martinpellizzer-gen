    "intro": "Dichanthelium spretum, commonly known as the rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and floodplain forests. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. Dichanthelium spretum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
