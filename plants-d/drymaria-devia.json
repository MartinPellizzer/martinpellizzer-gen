It typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. The plant has small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Drymaria devia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
