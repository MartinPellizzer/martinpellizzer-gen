    "intro": "Deschampsia chrysantha, commonly known as golden tuftgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and bright yellow inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Deschampsia chrysantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
