    "intro": "Dactylostemon estrellensis, commonly known as the Estrellan star-leaf, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to a small area in Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in specific microhabitats with limited sunlight. Due to habitat loss and limited seed dispersal, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival. Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on plant adaptation and biodiversity."
