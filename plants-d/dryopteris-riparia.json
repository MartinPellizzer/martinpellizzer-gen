    "intro": "Dryopteris riparia, commonly known as the Eastern wood fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a tall, slender rhizome with bipinnate fronds that are dark green and often have a distinctive, slightly curled appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
