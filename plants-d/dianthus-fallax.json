    "intro": "Dianthus fallax, commonly known as the rock campion, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Dianthus fallax is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
