    "intro": "Dendrobium secundum f. album, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces long, drooping inflorescences with numerous blooms, making it a popular choice for ornamental purposes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is valued for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
