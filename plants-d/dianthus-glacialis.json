    "intro": "Dianthus glacialis, commonly known as the glacier pink, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, helping to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Dianthus glacialis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
