    "intro": "Dendrobium vulcanicum, commonly known as the Vulcan orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the volcanic regions of Indonesia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are fleshy and often arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Dendrobium vulcanicum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
