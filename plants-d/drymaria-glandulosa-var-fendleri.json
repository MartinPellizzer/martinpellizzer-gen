    "intro": "Drymaria glandulosa var. fendleri, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss, reflecting its drought-tolerant nature. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing desert soils."
