It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, woody stems and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant contains psychoactive alkaloids, including dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which contribute to its traditional use in shamanic rituals. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-yellow in color, while the fruit is a small, fleshy berry. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a significant role in both ecological and cultural contexts."
