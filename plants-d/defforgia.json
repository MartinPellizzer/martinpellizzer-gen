    "intro": "Defforgia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer in the dappled light of the forest understory. The plant produces striking, bioluminescent flowers that glow faintly at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its roots are known to secrete a mild hallucinogenic substance, which has been studied for its potential medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Defforgia is now classified as an endangered species."
