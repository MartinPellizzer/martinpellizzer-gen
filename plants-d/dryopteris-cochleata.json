    "intro": "Dryopteris cochleata, commonly known as the curled shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, tightly curled fronds that unfurl as they mature. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
