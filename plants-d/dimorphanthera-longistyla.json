    "intro": "Dimorphanthera longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled dimorphanthera, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plant has two distinct floral morphs, a feature that contributes to its pollination strategy. Its flowers typically have long styles and are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
