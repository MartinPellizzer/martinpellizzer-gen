    "intro": "Dryopteris hostmannii, commonly known as the Hostmann's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely divided, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus."
