    "intro": "Duguetia paraensis, commonly known as the Amazonian bellflower, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Its leaves are typically alternate and palmately lobed, with a rough texture. Duguetia paraensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense rainforest canopies."
