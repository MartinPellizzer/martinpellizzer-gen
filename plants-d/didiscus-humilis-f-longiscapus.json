    "intro": "Didiscus humilis f. longiscapus, commonly known as the long-stalked didiscus, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or containers. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular ornamental plant among succulent enthusiasts."
