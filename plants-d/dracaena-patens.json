    "intro": "Dracaena patens, commonly known as the \"Red-edge Dracaena,\" is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Africa. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are bright green with striking red or orange margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Dracaena patens thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive indoors with minimal care."
