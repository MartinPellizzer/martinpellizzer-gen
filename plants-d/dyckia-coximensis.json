    "intro": "Dyckia coximensis, commonly known as the Rio das Ostras bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The leaves are typically stiff and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. It produces vibrant red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding to its ornamental value. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience."
