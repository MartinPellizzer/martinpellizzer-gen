    "intro": "Dennstaedtia smithii, commonly known as the common sword fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that resemble a sword. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture and a dark green color."
