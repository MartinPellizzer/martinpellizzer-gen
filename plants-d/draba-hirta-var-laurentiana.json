    "intro": "Draba hirta var. laurentiana, commonly known as Laurentian draba, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States and parts of Canada. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky, open habitats such as alpine meadows and forest edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Its leaves are usually basal, with a hairy texture, and the plant is often found in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
