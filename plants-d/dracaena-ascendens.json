    "intro": "Dracaena ascendens, commonly known as the ribbon plant, is a striking evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its long, narrow, dark green leaves that grow in a rosette pattern, giving it a unique and elegant appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate to bright indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Dracaena ascendens is also known for its air-purifying qualities, contributing to improved indoor air quality."
