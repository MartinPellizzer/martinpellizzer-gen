    "intro": "Dendrobium lompobatangense, commonly known as the Lompobatang orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Philippines. It is an epiphytic orchid that thrives in humid, tropical environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant features long, cane-like stems covered with clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that help it conserve moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
