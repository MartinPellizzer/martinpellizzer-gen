    "intro": "Dryas grandis, commonly known as the mountain avens, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herb that thrives in cold, rocky environments, often growing at high elevations or in tundra habitats. The plant features a rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Its flowers are typically white or pink, with five petals, and bloom in late summer. Dryas grandis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for pollinators in its native habitats."
