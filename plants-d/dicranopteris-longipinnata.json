    "intro": "Dicranopteris longipinnata, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It has large, floating fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length, with a distinctive pinnate structure. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are covered in small, scale-like structures that help reduce water loss and provide a habitat for microorganisms."
