    "intro": "Diplazium hirtipes f. nigropaleaceum, commonly known as the black-veined fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive foliage. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a dark green coloration and prominent, often blackish veins that contrast sharply with the lighter leaflets. It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Indonesia and the Philippines, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's morphology includes a short, creeping rhizome and sterile fronds that are often shorter than the fertile ones. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical collections."
