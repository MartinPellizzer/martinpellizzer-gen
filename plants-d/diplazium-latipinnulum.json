    "intro": "Diplazium latipinnulum, commonly known as the broad-pinnate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are divided into broad, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, allowing it to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the water. Diplazium latipinnulum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
