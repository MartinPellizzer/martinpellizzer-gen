    "intro": "Diplazium calogramma, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds with a bright yellow-green color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce upright, lanceolate leaves. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Diplazium calogramma is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
