    "intro": "Dryopteris rojasii, commonly known as the Rojas' wood fern, is a species of fern native to the cloud forests of central and southern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sorus. Dryopteris rojasii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
