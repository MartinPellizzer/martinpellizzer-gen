It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and striking, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in association with other epiphytic orchids. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are highly fragrant and bloom during the spring and early summer. Dendrolirium latilabellum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
