    "intro": "Deschampsia flexuosa f. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bentgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass that thrives in moist, acidic soils. It features slender, creeping stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers. It is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
