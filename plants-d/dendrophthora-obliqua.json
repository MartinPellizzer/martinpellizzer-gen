    "intro": "Dendrophthora obliqua, commonly known as the oblique bracket fungus, is a basidiomycete fungus that primarily grows on decaying hardwoods. It is characterized by its bracket-like fruiting bodies, which are typically brown to reddish-brown in color. This fungus is saprophytic, meaning it decomposes dead organic matter, playing a vital role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems. It is often found on the trunks and branches of trees such as oaks and maples. Its presence is an indicator of mature, undisturbed forest environments."
