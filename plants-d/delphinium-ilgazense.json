    "intro": "Delphinium ilgazense, commonly known as the Ilgaz delphinium, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Ilgaz Mountains in Turkey. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided lobes, and it produces showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
