    "intro": "Desmodium nemorosum var. simplex, commonly known as smallleaf burrweed, is a perennial legume native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters. Its seed pods are hairy and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
