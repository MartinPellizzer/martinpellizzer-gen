    "intro": "Dryopteris crenulans, commonly known as the Boston fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its long, arching fronds that are covered in small, rounded leaflets. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, moist soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps. Dryopteris crenulans is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its lush, feathery appearance."
