    "intro": "Drymoglossum obovatum var. lutchuense, commonly known as the Lutchuense moss, is a variant of the broad-leafed moss species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its obovate, closely spaced leaves that are typically pale green to dark green in color. The plant forms dense, cushion-like growths, often found on shaded, moist soil or rock surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including capsules, are typically borne on short, erect stalks. This moss is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing soil in humid environments."
