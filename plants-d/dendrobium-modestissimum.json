    "intro": "Dendrobium modestissimum, commonly known as the modest dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical or subtropical climates. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in environments where soil is not always available. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink and purple. Dendrobium modestissimum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
