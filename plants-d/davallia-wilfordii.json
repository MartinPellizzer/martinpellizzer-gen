    "intro": "Davallia wilfordii, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive, lace-like appearance, often resembling the foliage of the traditional maidenhair fern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil to flourish. Its rhizomes grow horizontally, allowing it to spread and form dense mats over time. Davallia wilfordii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
