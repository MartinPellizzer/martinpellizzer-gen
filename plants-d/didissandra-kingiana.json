    "intro": "Didissandra kingiana, commonly known as the King's sandalwood, is a rare and critically endangered plant native to the island of Madagascar. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces unique, fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is highly threatened in the wild. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this rare botanical species."
