    "intro": "Daphne \u00d7 lepida, commonly known as the winter daphne, is a hybrid shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, evergreen foliage that remains vibrant throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, waxy flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring careful handling and placement."
