    "intro": "Dendrobium giluwense, commonly known as the Giluwense orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Indonesia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its blooms typically appear in shades of white, yellow, and orange, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. Dendrobium giluwense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
