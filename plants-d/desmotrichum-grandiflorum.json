    "intro": "Desmotrichum grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of tubular and ray florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It produces showy yellow flowers that are often visited by pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions."
