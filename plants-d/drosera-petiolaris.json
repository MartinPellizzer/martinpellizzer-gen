    "intro": "Drosera petiolaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are covered in sticky, glandular hairs which trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. The species is known for its ability to digest trapped prey using enzymes, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils."
