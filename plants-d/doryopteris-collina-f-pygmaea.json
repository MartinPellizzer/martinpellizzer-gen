    "intro": "Doryopteris collina f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf cliff fern, is a compact, low-growing fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 15 centimeters in length, giving it a soft, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are short and stout, anchoring it to the substrate while supporting its growth. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a ground cover."
