    "intro": "Dendrobium randaiense, commonly known as the Shikoku orchid, is a species of orchid native to Japan. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and it blooms with striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its flowers typically appear in summer and are arranged in racemes, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Dendrobium randaiense is valued for its beauty and is often cultivated for its decorative appeal in gardens and as a houseplant."
