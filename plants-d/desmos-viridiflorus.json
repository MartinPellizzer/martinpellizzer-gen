It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its bright green flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a striking contrast against its broad, waxy leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
