    "intro": "Dendrobium microglossum, commonly known as the miniature lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and typically attaches itself to trees or rocks. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Dendrobium microglossum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral structure."
