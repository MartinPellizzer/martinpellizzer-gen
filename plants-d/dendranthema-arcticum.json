    "intro": "Dendranthema arcticum, commonly known as Arctic chamomile, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It features small, yellow flower heads surrounded by white to pale blue ray florets, resembling those of chamomile. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. Dendranthema arcticum plays a role in pollination and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
