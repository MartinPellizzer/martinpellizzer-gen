It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain several small, rounded seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas."
