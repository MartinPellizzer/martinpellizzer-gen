    "intro": "Durabaculum bandaense, commonly known as the Banda Island rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Banda Islands in Indonesia. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Durabaculum bandaense is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited geographic distribution."
