    "intro": "Ditaxis haitiensis, commonly known as the Haitian ditaxis, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
