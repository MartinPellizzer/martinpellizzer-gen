    "intro": "Dryopteris alata var. irregularis, commonly known as the variable lady fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate fronds that are often asymmetrical, giving it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are typically gray-green in color and have a wavy or undulating margin. This variety thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
