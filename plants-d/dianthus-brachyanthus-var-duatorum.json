    "intro": "Dianthus brachyanthus var. duatorum, commonly known as the two-colored carnation, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its showy, bicolor flowers that typically feature a pink or red center surrounded by white petals. The plant grows as a compact, bushy perennial with dense foliage and is well-suited for rock gardens or containers. It prefers full sun and well-drained soil, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The flowers bloom in spring and early summer, adding vibrant color to gardens with their striking color contrast."
