    "intro": "Dunbaria latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf dunbaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright, branching stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a slightly wavy margin, and are arranged alternately along the stems. Dunbaria latifolia prefers well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and woodland borders."
