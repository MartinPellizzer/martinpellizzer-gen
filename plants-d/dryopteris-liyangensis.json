    "intro": "Dryopteris liyangensis, commonly known as the Liyang water fern, is a rare species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the undersides of its fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
