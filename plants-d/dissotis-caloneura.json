    "intro": "Dissotis caloneura, commonly known as the narrow-veined dissotis, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, which are a defining feature of the grass family. Dissotis caloneura is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or wetlands. Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to humid, tropical climates and its role in local ecosystems."
