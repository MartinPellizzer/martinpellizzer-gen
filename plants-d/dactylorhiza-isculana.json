    "intro": "Dactylorhiza isculana, commonly known as the Sardinian marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sardinia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces spikes of fragrant, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in wet, calcareous soils and is often found in marshy or boggy habitats. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several European countries."
