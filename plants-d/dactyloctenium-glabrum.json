    "intro": "Dactyloctenium glabrum, commonly known as smooth fingergrass, is a low-growing annual grass native to the southeastern United States. It has slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
