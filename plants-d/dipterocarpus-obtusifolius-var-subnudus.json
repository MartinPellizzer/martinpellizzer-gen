    "intro": "Dipterocarpus obtusifolius var. subnudus, commonly known as the glossy ironwood, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, hard, and durable wood, which is highly valued for construction and furniture. The leaves are typically elliptical and glossy, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in humid environments. This variant differs from the typical form by having fewer leaf hairs, giving it a smoother appearance. It thrives in lowland rainforests and plays an important role in the ecological structure of these habitats."
