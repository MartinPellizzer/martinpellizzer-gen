    "intro": "Dischidia thaithongiae, commonly known as the Thai bubble vine, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its distinctive swollen, bubble-like stems that store water. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by berries that are typically red or orange when mature. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
