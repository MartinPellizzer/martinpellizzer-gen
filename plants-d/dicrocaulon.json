    "intro": "Dicrocaulon, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its milky sap, which is a distinguishing botanical feature. The plants typically have opposite, ovate leaves and produce showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange. Dicrocaulon species are often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. They play an important role in supporting pollinators, including butterflies and bees."
