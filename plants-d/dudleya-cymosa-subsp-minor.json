    "intro": "Dudleya cymosa subsp. minor, commonly known as the Coast Dudleya, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
