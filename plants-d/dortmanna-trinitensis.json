    "intro": "Dortmanna trinitensis, commonly known as the Trinidad lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid tropical environments. It is characterized by its greenish to yellowish thallus, which is often covered in a fine layer of powdery bloom. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found growing on tree trunks and branches in the Caribbean region. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
