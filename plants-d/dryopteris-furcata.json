    "intro": "Dryopteris furcata, commonly known as the Boston fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its feathery, arching fronds that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense clumps. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as an ornamental plant in gardens and indoor settings."
