    "intro": "Desmodium hjalmarsonii, commonly known as Hjalmarson's burrweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by hairy, three-lobed pods that contain several seeds. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or ascending, often forming dense mats in disturbed soils. The species is known for its ability to thrive in dry, sandy environments, making it an important pioneer plant in ecological succession."
