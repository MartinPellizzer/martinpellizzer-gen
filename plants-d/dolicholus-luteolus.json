    "intro": "Dolicholus luteolus, commonly known as the yellow-tailed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and its striking yellow and green floral structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive yellowish hue that attracts specific pollinators. The botanical features of Dolicholus luteolus make it an important subject in studies of orchid ecology and evolution."
