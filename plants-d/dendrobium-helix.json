    "intro": "Dendrobium helix, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive spiral pattern on the petals. Dendrobium helix is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
