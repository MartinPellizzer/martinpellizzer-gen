    "intro": "Diplazium swartzii, commonly known as the slender chain fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that form a dense, cascading appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and colonize shaded forest floors. Its fronds are bi-pinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give it a delicate, lacy texture. Diplazium swartzii thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
