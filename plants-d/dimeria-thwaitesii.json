    "intro": "Dimeria thwaitesii, commonly known as the sand dune daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure adapted to sandy environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it conserve water in harsh conditions. Dimeria thwaitesii is often found growing on coastal dunes and in sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing the environment."
