    "intro": "Didymocarpus simplex, commonly known as the slender spurge or slender false spurge, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, with yellow petals that attract insects for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
