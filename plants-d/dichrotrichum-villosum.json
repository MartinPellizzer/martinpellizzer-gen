    "intro": "Dichrotrichum villosum, commonly known as the silky hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes and ecological restoration projects."
