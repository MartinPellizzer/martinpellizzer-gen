    "intro": "Dunalia senticosa, commonly known as the sensitive dunalia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring compound leaves and pods that contain its seeds. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine. The name \"sensitive\" likely refers to its responsiveness to environmental stimuli, though this aspect is less documented in scientific literature."
