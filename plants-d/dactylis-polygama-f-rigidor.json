    "intro": "Dactylis polygama f. rigidor, commonly known as rigid dactylis, is a variant of the meadow grass species characterized by its stiff, upright growth habit. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate climates, often found in meadows and along roadsides. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to grazing and is sometimes used in pastureland due to its hardy nature. The rigid form of this plant is distinguished by its more compact and sturdy structure compared to the typical form."
