    "intro": "Dampiera reinwardtii, commonly known as the coastal dampiera, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white to pale blue flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Dampiera reinwardtii is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands, playing a role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
