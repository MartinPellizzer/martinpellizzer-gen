    "intro": "Delphinium linearilobum var. crispulum, commonly known as the crested larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the western United States. It features tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers with long, narrow petals. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is notable for its finely frilled or crinkled leaf margins, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
