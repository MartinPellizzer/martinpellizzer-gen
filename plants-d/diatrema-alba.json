    "intro": "Diatrema alba, commonly known as the white coral mushroom, is a species of fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its pale, coral-like appearance with a fleshy, gelatinous cap and stem. The mushroom typically grows in association with decaying wood, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are released from a central stem, and the fruiting body is usually small, measuring up to 5 centimeters in height. Diatrema alba is not considered edible and is sometimes mistaken for other coral-like fungi due to its similar appearance."
