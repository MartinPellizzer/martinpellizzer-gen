    "intro": "Diospyros, commonly known as persimmon, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ebenaceae. It includes around 400 species, many of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plants are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. Many species produce edible fruits that are rich in nutrients and have a sweet, sometimes astringent flavor. The wood of some species is highly valued for its density and durability, making it useful in furniture and tool-making."
