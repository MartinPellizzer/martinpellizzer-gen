    "intro": "Dendrochilum ambangense, commonly known as the Ambangense tree orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to the humid, shaded environment of the forest canopy. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
