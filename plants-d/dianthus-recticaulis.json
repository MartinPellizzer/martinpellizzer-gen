    "intro": "Dianthus recticaulis, commonly known as the upright carnation, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine layer of hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Its flowers have five petals arranged in a star shape, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
