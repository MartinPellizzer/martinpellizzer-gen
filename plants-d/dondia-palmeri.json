    "intro": "Dondia palmeri, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Dondia palmeri is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in sandy or rocky soils."
