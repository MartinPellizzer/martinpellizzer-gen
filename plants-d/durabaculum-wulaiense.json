    "intro": "Durabaculum wulaiense, commonly known as the Wulai rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a unique, spurred lip that is a key identifying feature. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in humid, shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
