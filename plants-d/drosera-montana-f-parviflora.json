    "intro": "Drosera montana f. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered mountain sundew, is a variant of the mountain sundew, characterized by its diminutive, pinkish-white flowers. It is a carnivorous plant native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. Its compact growth habit and unique morphology make it a striking addition to both natural and cultivated environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled conditions to ensure its survival."
