    "intro": "Dicksonia plumieri var. heteroloba, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its massive, tree-like trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a dense, fibrous mass, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments. It thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often found in forest understories. The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, making it a unique and striking plant in its natural habitat."
