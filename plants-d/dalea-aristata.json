    "intro": "Dalea aristata, commonly known as the prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny pods and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Dalea aristata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
