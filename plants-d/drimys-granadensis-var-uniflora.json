    "intro": "Drimys granadensis var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower drimys, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with lanceolate leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and it is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
