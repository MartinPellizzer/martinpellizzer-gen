    "intro": "Dianthera viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered dianthera, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Dianthera viridiflora is often found in shaded forest understories, where it forms dense mats of foliage. Its unique coloration and habitat make it a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
