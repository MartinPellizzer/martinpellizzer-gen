    "intro": "Dimocarpus confinis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tamarind, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces oval, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are encased in a hard, acidic pulp. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland areas near rivers. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some regions for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
