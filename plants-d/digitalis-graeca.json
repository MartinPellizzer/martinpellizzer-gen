    "intro": "Digitalis graeca, commonly known as the Greek foxglove, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, sparsely hairy stems that bear whorled, violet-purple flowers with spurred petals. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive, waxy texture. Digitalis graeca is closely related to other foxglove species and contains cardiac glycosides, which have historically been used in medicine."
