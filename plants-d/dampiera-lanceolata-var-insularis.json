    "intro": "Dampiera lanceolata var. insularis, commonly known as the island dampiera, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in dune environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale blue or violet in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing nectar for native pollinators."
