    "intro": "Dendrothrix multiglandulosa, commonly known as the many-glandular tree, is a rare and unique member of the Santalaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and the presence of numerous glandular structures on its stems and leaves. The plant is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it grows as an epiphyte or in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually small, lance-shaped, and have a smooth surface with prominent veins. The plant's ability to form symbiotic relationships with fungi enhances its nutrient absorption, contributing to its survival in nutrient-poor soils."
