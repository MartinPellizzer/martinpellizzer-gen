    "intro": "Dalbergia stuhlmannii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has bipinnate leaves, and its flowers are typically small and clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
