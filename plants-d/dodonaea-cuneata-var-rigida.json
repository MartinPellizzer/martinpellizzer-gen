It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
