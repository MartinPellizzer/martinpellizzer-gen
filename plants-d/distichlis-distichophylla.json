    "intro": "Distichlis distichophylla, commonly known as the saltbush or glassworts, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of the Middle East. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, and its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in dense spikes. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms. Distichlis distichophylla is also valued for its ability to tolerate extreme environmental conditions, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
