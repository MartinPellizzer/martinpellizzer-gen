    "intro": "Diplachne spicata, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that often form dense stands, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib. Its inflorescence consists of spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Diplachne spicata is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
