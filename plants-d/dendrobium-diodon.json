    "intro": "Dendrobium diodon, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, arranged along the stems, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Dendrobium diodon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its delicate floral display."
