    "intro": "Dalbergia tsiandalana, commonly known as the Madagascar rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark timber that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species."
