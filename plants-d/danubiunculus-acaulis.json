    "intro": "Danubiunculus acaulis, commonly known as the Danube stalkless plant, is a unique species of aquatic plant characterized by its absence of stems. It is native to the Danube River basin and thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant's leaves are typically elongated and float on the water surface, facilitating photosynthesis. Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal through water currents. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
