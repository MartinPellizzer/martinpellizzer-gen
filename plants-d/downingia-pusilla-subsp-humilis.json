    "intro": "Downingia pusilla subsp. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf Downingia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically reaches heights of only a few centimeters, with dense clusters of tiny, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas and streamside habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a compact rosette near the ground. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and light conditions."
