    "intro": "Doxantha unguis-cati var. exoleta, commonly known as the cat's claw vine, is a climbing plant native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and distinctive, claw-like tendrils that help it climb supports. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are small and yellow, often appearing in clusters. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative vine in gardens. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
