    "intro": "Daphne mezereum var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated mezereum, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage that features white and green patterns on its leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. These flowers are followed by small, orange-red berries that mature in late spring. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soils."
