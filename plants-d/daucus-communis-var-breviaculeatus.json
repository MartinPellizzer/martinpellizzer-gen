    "intro": "Daucus communis var. breviaculeatus, commonly known as the short-stalked wild carrot, is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white flowers that bloom in umbrella-shaped clusters. Its roots are slender and often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic properties. This variety is distinguished by its shorter petioles compared to other Daucus species, making it easily identifiable in the field."
