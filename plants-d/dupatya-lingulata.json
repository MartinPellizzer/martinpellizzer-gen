    "intro": "Dupatya lingulata, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped fronds that emit a faint golden hue under sunlight. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained, acidic soil. Its unique morphology makes it a sought-after species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss, Dupatya lingulata is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
