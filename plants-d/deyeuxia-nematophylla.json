    "intro": "Deyeuxia nematophylla, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in marshy areas, pond margins, and along streams, where it thrives in saturated soil conditions. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems. Deyeuxia nematophylla is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and poor soil nutrients."
