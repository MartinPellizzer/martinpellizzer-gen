    "intro": "Dendrosicus kennedyae, commonly known as Kennedy's tree-dweller, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its woody stem and dense, evergreen foliage, which allows it to thrive in the shaded understory of the forest canopy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dendrosicus kennedyae is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
