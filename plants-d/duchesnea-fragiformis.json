    "intro": "Duchesnea fragiformis, commonly known as the silverweed or creeping oxalis, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It has a low-growing, sprawling habit with runners that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant features trifoliate leaves that are typically silver-white underneath, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small, yellow, and borne in clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Duchesnea fragiformis thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and streambanks."
