    "intro": "Desmodium procumbens var. exiguum, commonly known as little desmodium, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that lie close to the ground and often root at the nodes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Its botanical structure supports its role as a ground cover plant, contributing to soil stabilization and ecological diversity."
