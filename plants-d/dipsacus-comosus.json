    "intro": "Dipsacus comosus, commonly known as the goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces distinctive, spiky seed heads that persist into winter, adding ornamental value to gardens. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its tactile texture. Dipsacus comosus is typically found in grasslands, woodlands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
