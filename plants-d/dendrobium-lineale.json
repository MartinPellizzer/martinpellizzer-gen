It is an epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its stems are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Dendrobium lineale is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
