It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are often borne in terminal panicles. It is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is particularly noticeable when the leaves are crushed. Dicliptera foetida var. foetida is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
