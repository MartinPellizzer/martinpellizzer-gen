    "intro": "Delphinium saxatile, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Delphinium saxatile is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like buttercups and anemones. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
