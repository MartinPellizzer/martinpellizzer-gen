    "intro": "Dryopteris abbottiana, commonly known as Abbott's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green and deeply divided. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in humid conditions."
