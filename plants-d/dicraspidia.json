    "intro": "Dicraspidia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are often clustered in racemate inflorescences. The leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Dicraspidia species are native to various regions in Africa, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. These plants are often valued for their hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in traditional crafts and construction."
