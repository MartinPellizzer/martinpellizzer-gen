    "intro": "Dennstaedtia resinifera, commonly known as the resinous shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often covered in a waxy, resinous substance, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream banks, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The plant's unique resinous coating may serve as a protective mechanism against desiccation and herbivory."
