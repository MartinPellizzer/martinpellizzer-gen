    "intro": "Diplatia maidenii, commonly known as the slender rock heath, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and is often found in coastal dunes or cliffs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
