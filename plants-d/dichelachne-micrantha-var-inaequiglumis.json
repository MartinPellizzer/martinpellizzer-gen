    "intro": "Dichelachne micrantha var. inaequiglumis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dichelachne, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with a distinct glabrous surface. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, with each containing two to three florets. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other grasses in the genus, particularly in the structure of its lemma and palea. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
