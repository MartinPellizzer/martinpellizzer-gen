    "intro": "Dioon edule subsp. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dioon, is a species of cycad native to parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that are narrow and strap-like. The plant produces large, spore-bearing cones, with the female cones being particularly showy and often used in traditional ceremonies. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its ornamental value and cultural significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
