    "intro": "Dasyphyllum diacanthoides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often fragrant, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid native environment. Dasyphyllum diacanthoides is also valued for its timber, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture."
