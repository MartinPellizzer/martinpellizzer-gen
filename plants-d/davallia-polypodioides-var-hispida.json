    "intro": "Davallia polypodioides var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a rosette of leathery, dark green fronds that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. It thrives in shady, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
