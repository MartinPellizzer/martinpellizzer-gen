    "intro": "Deschampsia multiflora, commonly known as bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green blades and forms dense, sod-like growth. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, prairies, and along stream banks. It produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Deschampsia multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in erosion control and landscaping."
