    "intro": "Dryopteris latibasis, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, triangular-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The broad-leaf wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
