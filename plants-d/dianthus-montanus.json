    "intro": "Dianthus montanus, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of pink or white flowers with five petals. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often surrounded by velvety, woolly leaves. Dianthus montanus thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to flourish in alpine gardens."
