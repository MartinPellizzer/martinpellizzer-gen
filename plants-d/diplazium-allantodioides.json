    "intro": "Diplazium allantodioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves."
