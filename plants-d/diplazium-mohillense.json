It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structure with a distinctive, segmented appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, typical of many fern species. Diplazium mohillense plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
