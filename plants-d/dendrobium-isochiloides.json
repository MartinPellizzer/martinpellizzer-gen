    "intro": "Dendrobium isochiloides, commonly known as the yellow-lipped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces striking yellow and green flowers with a distinctive lip that is often marked with a yellow stripe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
