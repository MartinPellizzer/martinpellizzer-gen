    "intro": "Dendrobium dantaniense, commonly known as the Dantaniense orchid, is a species native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its tropical habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to various growing conditions."
