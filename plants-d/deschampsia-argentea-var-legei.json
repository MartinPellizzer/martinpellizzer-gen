    "intro": "Deschampsia argentea var. legei, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and tufted growth habit, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used for soil stabilization in erosion-prone areas."
