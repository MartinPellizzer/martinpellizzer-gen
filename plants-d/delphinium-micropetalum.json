    "intro": "Delphinium micropetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. Delphinium micropetalum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers but is toxic to humans and livestock due to the presence of alkaloids."
