    "intro": "Duranta ilicifolia, commonly known as the golden dewdrop or glorybower, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy green surface and silver-white undersides. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that transition from white to yellow as they mature. These flowers are followed by bright blue or purple berries that are edible for humans and birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant foliage and showy blooms."
