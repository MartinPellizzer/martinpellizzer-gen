    "intro": "Drypetes burnleyae, commonly known as the Burnley's drypetes, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with unique latex-producing properties. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-yellow and are clustered in cup-shaped structures called cyathia. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
