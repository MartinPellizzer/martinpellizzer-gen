    "intro": "Dactyloctenium verticillatum, commonly known as the whorled grass or false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the warm temperate and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, whorled arrangement of leaves around the stem. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can dominate certain habitats. It is often found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks."
