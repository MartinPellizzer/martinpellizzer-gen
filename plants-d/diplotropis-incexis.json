    "intro": "Diplotropis incexis, commonly known as the narrowleaf false indigo, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soil conditions, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in woodland edges and dry habitats, and its seeds are dispersed by ants, a process known as myrmecochory. The plant's ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
