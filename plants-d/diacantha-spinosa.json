    "intro": "Diacantha spinosa, commonly known as the spiny diacantha, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
