    "intro": "Doronicum, commonly known as leopard's bane, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of about 15 species, most of which are native to Europe and western Asia. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are upright and hairy. The flowers are usually yellow with a distinctive purple or brown center, forming a composite flower head. Doronicum species are often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas, and they bloom from late spring to early summer."
