    "intro": "Dendrobium labangense, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in the humid, shaded environments of its habitat. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in the rainforest ecosystem. Dendrobium labangense is a popular species among orchid enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
