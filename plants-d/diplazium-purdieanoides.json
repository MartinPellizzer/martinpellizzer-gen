    "intro": "Diplazium purdieanoides, commonly known as the purple fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often tinged with purple hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. Diplazium purdieanoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
