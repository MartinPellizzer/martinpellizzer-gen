It features a robust root system and upright, branched stems that are often covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are usually hairy on the upper surface. Dorycnium calycinum is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it valuable in agricultural and ecological contexts."
