    "intro": "Duvaucellia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their erect, branching stems and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Duvaucellia species are typically drought-tolerant and have adapted to thrive in harsh desert environments. Their seeds are enclosed in pods and often dispersed by wind, contributing to their survival in challenging climates."
