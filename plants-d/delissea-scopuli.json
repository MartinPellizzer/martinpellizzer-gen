    "intro": "Delissea scopuli, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It thrives in rocky, arid environments, often found on limestone or granite surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and phototrophic partners. Delissea scopuli plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in harsh ecosystems. Its slow growth and resilience make it an indicator species for environmental conditions."
