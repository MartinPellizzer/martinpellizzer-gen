    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata subsp. nestorii, commonly known as the tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along coastal areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, including erosion control and forage production."
