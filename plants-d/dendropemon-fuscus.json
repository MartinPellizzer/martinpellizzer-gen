    "intro": "Dendropemon fuscus, commonly known as the darkwood orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the humid tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of purple and pink, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Dendropemon fuscus is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
