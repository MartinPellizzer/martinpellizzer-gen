    "intro": "Deyeuxia pallens, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, silver-tomentose leaves and panicle-like inflorescences that produce small, pale florets. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and stream banks, and is often found in wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. Deyeuxia pallens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity."
