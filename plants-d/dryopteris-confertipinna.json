    "intro": "Dryopteris confertipinna, commonly known as the dense-pinnate wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It features a short, stout rhizome with dense, dark brown, scaly roots. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, compact structure that gives the plant its common name. The leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
