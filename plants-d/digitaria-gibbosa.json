    "intro": "Digitaria gibbosa, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its common name. Digitaria gibbosa is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain environments."
