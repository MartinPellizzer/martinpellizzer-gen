    "intro": "Dryopteris laeta, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of polypody fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that often display a golden or bronze hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Dryopteris laeta is relatively hardy and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common sight in forested areas."
