    "intro": "Dryopteris khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply divided fronds that typically grow in a rosette formation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive shield-like shape, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
