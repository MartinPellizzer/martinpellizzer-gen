    "intro": "Diplopappus trichophyllus, commonly known as the hairy pappus plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, with bracts that are covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are typically narrow and alternate along the stem. The hairy pappus, a structure at the base of the flower, aids in seed dispersal by wind."
