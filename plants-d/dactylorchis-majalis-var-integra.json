    "intro": "Dactylorchis majalis var. integra, commonly known as the pink fairy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. It has a short-lived rhizome and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
