    "intro": "Darwinia speciosa, commonly known as the showy darwinia, is a striking perennial herb native to south-eastern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The flowers are typically pink or red and are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has fibrous roots and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
