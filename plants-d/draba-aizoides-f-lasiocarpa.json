    "intro": "Draba aizoides f. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, hairy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Native to rocky or alpine environments, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its hirsute leaves and compact growth form make it well adapted to harsh mountainous climates."
