    "intro": "Deschampsia parvula, commonly known as little blue grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America. It features fine, blue-green blades that are typically less than 10 cm tall, forming dense, mat-like growth. The plant produces slender spikes of pale blue or silver flowers in late summer, which are characteristic of the Deschampsia genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects."
