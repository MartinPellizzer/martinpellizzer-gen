    "intro": "Dicoma humilis, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure called a pappus. Dicoma humilis is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
