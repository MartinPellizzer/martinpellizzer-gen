    "intro": "Dendrobium katherinae, commonly known as the Katherinae orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its flowers typically bloom during the cooler months, adding a unique ornamental value to its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
