It features narrow, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant is noted for its clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring careful handling."
