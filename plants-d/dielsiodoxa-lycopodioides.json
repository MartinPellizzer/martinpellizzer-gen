    "intro": "Dielsiodoxa lycopodioides, commonly known as the New Zealand clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant forms dense mats on the forest floor, often in shaded, moist environments. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, with sporophylls bearing sporangia on the upper surface. Dielsiodoxa lycopodioides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
