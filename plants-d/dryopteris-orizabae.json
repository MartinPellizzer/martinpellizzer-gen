    "intro": "Dryopteris orizabae, commonly known as the Oaxaca water fern, is a species of fern native to Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble floating leaves, adapted for aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and colonize wetlands and marshy areas. Its fronds are typically bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. Dryopteris orizabae plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
