    "intro": "Drosera verrucata, commonly known as the cushion sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form composed of numerous small, sticky leaves. The leaves are covered in fine, glandular hairs that secrete a sweet-smelling mucilage to trap insects. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in wet, boggy environments. Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake by digesting captured prey."
