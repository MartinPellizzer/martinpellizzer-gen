    "intro": "Dracophyllum drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's draco, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces tiny, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in arid gardens for its ornamental value."
