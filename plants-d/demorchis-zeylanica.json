    "intro": "Demorchis zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood. The plant has smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange-red fruits containing three seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in its native habitat."
