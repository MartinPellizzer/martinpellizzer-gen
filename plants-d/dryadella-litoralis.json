    "intro": "Dryadella litoralis, commonly known as the coastal dryadella, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the western United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbel-like inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, demonstrating adaptability to saline and wind-swept environments. Its leaves are finely divided and often bluish-green, while its small white flowers bloom in late spring. Dryadella litoralis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
