    "intro": "Diplostephium spinulosum, commonly known as the spiny false arum, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix and a spathe. The plant features dark green, arrow-shaped leaves with prominent veins and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist, shady environments. The spiny structures on its stems and leaves serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
