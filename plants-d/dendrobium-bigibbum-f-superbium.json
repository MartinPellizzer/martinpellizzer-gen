    "intro": "Dendrobium bigibbum f. superbium, commonly known as the superb orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often in clusters. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and store water, helping it survive in its natural habitat. It is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
