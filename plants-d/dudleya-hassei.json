    "intro": "Dudleya hassei, commonly known as the coastal dudleya, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, often blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
