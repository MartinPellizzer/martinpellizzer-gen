    "intro": "Drosera whittakeri, commonly known as the Whittaker's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic soils and has a rosette structure with small, spoon-shaped leaves. It produces white flowers that are clustered in a dense inflorescence, and it is often found in swampy or boggy habitats. Drosera whittakeri is a rare and protected species, highlighting its ecological significance in its native environment."
