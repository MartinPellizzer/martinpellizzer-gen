    "intro": "Desmochaeta, commonly known as the silky nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or white, often blooming in late summer. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, turn from green to red as they mature. Desmochaeta is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats."
