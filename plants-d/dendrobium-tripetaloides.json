    "intro": "Dendrobium tripetaloides, commonly known as the three-petaled orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. Its leaves are usually long and strap-like, and it thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. It is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
