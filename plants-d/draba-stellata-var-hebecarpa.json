    "intro": "Draba stellata var. hebecarpa, commonly known as the slender starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically has a mat-forming habit with numerous slender stems and basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, appearing in early spring, and it thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth compared to the typical form of Draba stellata."
