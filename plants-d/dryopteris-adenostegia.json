    "intro": "Dryopteris adenostegia, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often golden-brown fronds that are densely covered with small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in humid conditions. The fronds are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a unique and ornamental appearance."
