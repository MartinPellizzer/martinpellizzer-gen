    "intro": "Dianella monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf flax lily, is a striking evergreen plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its single, sword-shaped leaf that can grow up to 1 meter in length, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, followed by dark blue berries that are a food source for native birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Dianella monophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
