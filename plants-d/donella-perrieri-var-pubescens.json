    "intro": "Donella perrieri var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent donella, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, pubescent leaves that give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
