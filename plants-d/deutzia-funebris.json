    "intro": "Deutzia funebris, commonly known as the weeping deutzia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its cascading clusters of white or pale pink flowers that appear in early summer. The plant has slender, arching branches that give it a graceful, weeping appearance. Its leaves are dark green and ovate, providing a striking contrast to the delicate blossoms. Deutzia funebris is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
