    "intro": "Dichaea echinocarpa var. lobata, commonly known as the lobate spikemoss, is a member of the family Lejeuneaceae and is characterized by its small, creeping stems and clustered, needle-like leaves. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain spores, which are dispersed by wind. Its morphology is adapted for epiphytic growth, allowing it to thrive on the surfaces of trees and rocks. This variety is distinguished by its lobed leaf shape, which sets it apart from other variants within the species."
