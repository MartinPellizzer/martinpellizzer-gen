    "intro": "Digitalis purpurea f. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada foxglove, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common foxglove. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which are tubular and arranged in a raceme. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Nevada, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. It is a perennial herb with lance-shaped leaves and a height ranging from 30 to 60 centimeters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
