    "intro": "Draconanthes chingazaense, commonly known as the Chingaza dragon orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Chingaza National Park in Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes and striking, violet-colored blooms. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this rare botanical treasure."
