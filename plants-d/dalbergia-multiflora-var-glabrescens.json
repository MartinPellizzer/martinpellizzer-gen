    "intro": "Dalbergia multiflora var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-flowered ironwood, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its dense, dark brown wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant features compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland forested areas. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
