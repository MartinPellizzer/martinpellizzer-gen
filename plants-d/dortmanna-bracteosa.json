    "intro": "Dortmanna bracteosa, commonly known as the bracteosa dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by triangular, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. Dortmanna bracteosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional herbal medicine."
