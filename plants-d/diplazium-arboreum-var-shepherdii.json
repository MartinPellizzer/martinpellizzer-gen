    "intro": "Diplazium arboreum var. shepherdii, commonly known as the tree fern, is a striking evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. The plant's rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its upright growth habit. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique feature makes it a fascinating subject for both botanical study and ecological observation."
