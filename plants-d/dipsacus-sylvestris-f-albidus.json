    "intro": "Dipsacus sylvestris f. albidus, commonly known as the white teasel, is a variant of the teasel plant characterized by its pale white bracts instead of the typical purple ones. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in disturbed soils and along woodland edges. The plant features a tall, spiny stem with large, heart-shaped leaves that are hairy and serrated. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, giving way to the distinctive, cone-like seed heads that are used in traditional herbal medicine. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for insects and birds."
