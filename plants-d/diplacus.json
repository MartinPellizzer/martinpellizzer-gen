    "intro": "Diplacus, commonly known as the monkeyflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. These plants typically have showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The leaves are usually alternate and can be either simple or lobed, depending on the species. Diplacus species are often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively easy to grow in gardens."
