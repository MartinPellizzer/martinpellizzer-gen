    "intro": "Diphyes montana, commonly known as the mountain diphyes, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which helps it survive in harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually broad and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Diphyes montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
