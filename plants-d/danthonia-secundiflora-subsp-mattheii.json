    "intro": "Danthonia secundiflora subsp. mattheii, commonly known as the Matthei's hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. This subspecies is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability."
