    "intro": "Dipsacus bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert's teasel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the burdock family (Araliaceae) and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive, bristled seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
