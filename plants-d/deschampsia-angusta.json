    "intro": "Deschampsia angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late summer. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as meadows, streambanks, and marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. Deschampsia angusta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
