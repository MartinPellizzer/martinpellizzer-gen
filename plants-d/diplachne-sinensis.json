    "intro": "Diplachne sinensis, commonly known as Chinese flat grass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flat leaves and dense growth habit, often forming a mat-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny environments such as wetlands and marshy areas. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, with small, two-lobed glumes. Diplachne sinensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
