    "intro": "Dryopteris tenuifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in distinct groups. Dryopteris tenuifrons is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
