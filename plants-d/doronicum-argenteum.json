    "intro": "Doronicum argenteum, commonly known as the silver leaved leopard's bane, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its silvery-white, hairy leaves and bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and long-lasting blooms, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Doronicum argenteum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
