    "intro": "Dianthus brevicaulis, commonly known as the cushion pink, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compact, succulent-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It is often found in rocky soils and coastal areas, thriving in full sun. Dianthus brevicaulis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
