    "intro": "Dendrobium schneiderae var. major, commonly known as the giant phalaenopsis, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in height, with clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, providing a lush, green appearance. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking floral display."
