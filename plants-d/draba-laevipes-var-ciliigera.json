    "intro": "Draba laevipes var. ciliigera, commonly known as the silkyleaf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features small, basal leaves that are densely hairy and often have ciliate margins, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are typically arranged in a loose panicle. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
