It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches a height of 5 to 15 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are usually lobed or divided, and it produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring.

Its ability to survive in harsh environments makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
