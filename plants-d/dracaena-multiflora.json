    "intro": "Dracaena multiflora, commonly known as the Madagascar dragon tree, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It features long, strap-like leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or bronze tint along the margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and ability to thrive in dry conditions. Dracaena multiflora is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ornamental appeal."
