    "intro": "Dictyoneura acuminata subsp. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited sandplain grass, is a member of the Poaceae family. It is a low-growing, perennial grass that typically forms dense mats on sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is found in coastal and inland sandplains, often in areas with low rainfall and high solar exposure."
