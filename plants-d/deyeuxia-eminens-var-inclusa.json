It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. This variant is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
