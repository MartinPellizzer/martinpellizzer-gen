    "intro": "Dubautia struthioloides, commonly known as the silverleaf dubautia, is a perennial shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and dry forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
