    "intro": "Dryopteris cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, shaggy fronds that resemble a cinnamon stick. It is native to North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a short, scaly rhizome that supports its upright, fertile fronds, which are typically longer than the sterile fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
