    "intro": "Dioscorea glomerulata var. mandonii, commonly known as the Mandon's yam, is a variant of the yam family native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of tuberous roots that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, green, heart-shaped leaves and bears clusters of yellowish-green flowers. Its tubers are typically elongated and have a rough, bark-like surface. The botanical interest in this variant lies in its potential medicinal properties and its role in local horticultural practices."
