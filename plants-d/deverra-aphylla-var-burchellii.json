    "intro": "Deverra aphylla var. burchellii, commonly known as the Burchell's devil's claw, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, claw-like seed pods that remain attached to the plant for an extended period. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its unique, woody fruit capsules. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. The species is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often found in regions with low rainfall."
