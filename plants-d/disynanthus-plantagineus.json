    "intro": "Disynanthus plantagineus, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, with leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
