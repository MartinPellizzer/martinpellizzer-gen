    "intro": "Dryopteris crassirhizoma, commonly known as the broad-rhizome wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bilobed fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, which help it survive in various soil conditions. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
