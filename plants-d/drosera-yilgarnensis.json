    "intro": "Drosera yilgarnensis, commonly known as the Yilgarn Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its flowers are small and usually pink or red, appearing on a spike above the leaves. Drosera yilgarnensis is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific conditions to thrive."
