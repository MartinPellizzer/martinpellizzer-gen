    "intro": "Dactylis brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved cat's-tail, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems with whorled leaves that are short and narrow. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, pale green to brownish flowers. Dactylis brevifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
