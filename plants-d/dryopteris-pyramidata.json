    "intro": "Dryopteris pyramidata, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, evergreen fronds that remain lush throughout the winter, giving it its common name. The fronds are lance-shaped with a serrated margin and a unique, pyramidal arrangement of pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds."
