    "intro": "Dendrium buxifolium, commonly known as the boxleaf dendrium, is a unique plant characterized by its foliage that resembles the leaves of boxwood. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in temperate climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. The plant's leaves are thick, waxy, and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in drier conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Dendrium buxifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of garden settings."
