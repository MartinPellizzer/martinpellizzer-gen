    "intro": "Dendrobium samoense, commonly known as the Samoan orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the islands of Samoa and nearby regions in the South Pacific. It features a sympodial growth habit with numerous cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically blooming during the wet season. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Dendrobium samoense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
