    "intro": "Draba asterophora, commonly known as the star-flowered rockcress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in alpine and arctic regions. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its flowering period occurs in early spring, and it is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Draba asterophora is often found in mountainous areas of Europe and Asia, where it contributes to the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems."
