    "intro": "Diplactis alpina, commonly known as the alpine diplactis, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth form and adaptations to cold, harsh environments. The plant typically features small, linear leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers during the short growing season. Diplactis alpina is often found in rocky or alpine meadows, where it relies on specific soil conditions and limited sunlight. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
