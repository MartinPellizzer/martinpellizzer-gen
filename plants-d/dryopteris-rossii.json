    "intro": "Dryopteris rossii, commonly known as the Ross's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features a robust rhizome system that supports its growth in shaded, moist environments. The plant has feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, elegant appearance. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
