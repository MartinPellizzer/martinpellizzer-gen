    "intro": "Didymocarpus frutescens, commonly known as the red sanders, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is highly valued in traditional medicine and ornamental horticulture."
