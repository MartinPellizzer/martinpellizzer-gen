    "intro": "Dianthus brachyanthus subsp. cantabricus, commonly known as the Cantabrian campion, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a perennial herb with erect, branched stems and basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers with five petals, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as cliffs and coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
