    "intro": "Dracaena novoguineensis, commonly known as the Guinean Dracaena, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the lowland rainforests of New Guinea. It features long, narrow, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the tips of its sturdy, upright stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
