    "intro": "Davallia grammatosora, commonly known as the feather-leaf hakea, is a rare and delicate fern native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and rocky outcrops. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
