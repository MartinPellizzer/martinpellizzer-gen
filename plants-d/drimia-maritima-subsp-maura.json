    "intro": "Drimia maritima subsp. maura, commonly known as sea onion or coastal onion, is a perennial bulbous plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and western Europe. It features strap-like, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments due to its tolerance for salt and wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
