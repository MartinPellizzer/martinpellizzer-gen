    "intro": "Diplostephium espinosae, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and are often used for ornamental purposes. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible fruits known as tunas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh desert conditions."
