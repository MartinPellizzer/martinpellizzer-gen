    "intro": "Draba stellata lusus traunsteineri, commonly known as the Traunsteiner's starweed, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cross-shaped flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically features basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
