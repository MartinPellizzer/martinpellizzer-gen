    "intro": "Doellingeria japonica, commonly known as Japanese bur reed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruit is a three-lobed achene enclosed in a persistent calyx, which aids in seed dispersal. Doellingeria japonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
