    "intro": "Dysoxylum siargaoense, commonly known as the Siargao ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hard, dense wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in lowland and montane rainforests. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable but endangered species."
