    "intro": "Durabaculum calophyllum, commonly known as the golden cupplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, arranged in cup-shaped clusters. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy rhizomes that help it survive in wetland environments. Durabaculum calophyllum is adapted to moist soils and is often found in swampy areas and along riverbanks."
