    "intro": "Dryopteris isabellina, commonly known as the Isabelline wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It features a distinctive, elegant frond structure with a narrow, elongated shape and a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The fronds are dark green and remain persistent through the winter, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
