    "intro": "Drymaria adiantoides, commonly known as the fern moss or false maidenhair, is a small, mat-forming plant that belongs to the family Drymariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps anchor it to substrates such as rocks or decaying wood. Drymaria adiantoides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
