    "intro": "Dendrobium crispatum, commonly known as the curly lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are covered in dense, dark green foliage. Its flowers are typically yellow or green with red or purple markings, and they bloom in clusters. Dendrobium crispatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
