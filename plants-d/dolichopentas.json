It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its striking, five-lobed leaves that resemble the shape of a pentagon. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by colorful bracts. Its foliage is thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.
