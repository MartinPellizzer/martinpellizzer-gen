    "intro": "Diplazium nipponicum, commonly known as Japanese basket fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with dense, compound fronds that are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is commonly found in forest understories. The fronds are typically divided into pinnae, giving the plant a lush, feathery appearance."
