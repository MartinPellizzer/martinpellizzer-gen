    "intro": "Drosera platystigma, commonly known as the broad-stemmed sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Droseraceae family and is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette and can vary in size depending on environmental conditions. Drosera platystigma is known for its ability to digest trapped prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils."
