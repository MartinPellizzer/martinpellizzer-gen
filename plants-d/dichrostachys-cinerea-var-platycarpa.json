    "intro": "Dichrostachys cinerea var. platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited burr legume, is a shrub native to tropical and southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, spiny, pod-like fruits. Its adaptability to poor soils and drought conditions makes it a common weed in disturbed areas. The variety platycarpa is distinguished by its broader, more rounded fruits compared to the typical form."
