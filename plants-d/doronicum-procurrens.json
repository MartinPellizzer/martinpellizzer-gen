    "intro": "Doronicum procurrens, commonly known as the creeping leopard's bane, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sunny to partially shaded soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms and ground-covering ability."
