    "intro": "Dracophyllum gracile, commonly known as the slender draco-berry, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and often consumed by birds and small mammals. Dracophyllum gracile thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
