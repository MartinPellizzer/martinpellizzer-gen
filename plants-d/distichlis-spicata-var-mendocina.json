    "intro": "Distichlis spicata var. mendocina, commonly known as the Mendocino saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal areas of California. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to coastal and dune environments. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and resilience to harsh conditions."
