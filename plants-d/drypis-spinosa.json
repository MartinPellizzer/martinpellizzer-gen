    "intro": "Drypis spinosa, commonly known as the spiny drypis, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features a short, thick stem with spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its adaptations make it well-suited for drought conditions. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
