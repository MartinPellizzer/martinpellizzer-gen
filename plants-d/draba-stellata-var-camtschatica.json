    "intro": "Draba stellata var. camtschatica, commonly known as the Kamchatka whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of the Russian Far East and parts of Siberia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a dense rosette of basal leaves and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic environments. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is closely related to other members of the Brassicaceae family, sharing similar floral structures and chemical compositions."
