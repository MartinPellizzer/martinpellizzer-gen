    "intro": "Drosera verticillata, commonly known as the spiral sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hair-like structures that secrete a sticky digestive fluid to trap insects. The plant's leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Drosera verticillata is known for its ability to photosynthesize during the day and digest captured prey at night."
