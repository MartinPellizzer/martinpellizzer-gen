    "intro": "Dracaena neobella, commonly known as the Madagascar dragon tree, is a striking evergreen plant native to Madagascar. It features tall, slender stems with long, narrow leaves that are typically dark green and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Dracaena neobella thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
