It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, erect stems with small, trifoliate leaves that have rounded or blunt tips. Its pea-like flowers are usually pink to purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. Dalea retusifolia plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
