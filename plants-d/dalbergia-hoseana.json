    "intro": "Dalbergia hoseana, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces hard, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
