    "intro": "Desmos verrucosus, commonly known as the warty desmos, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique warty texture on the leaves is a notable botanical feature. Desmos verrucosus is primarily of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unusual morphology and limited distribution."
