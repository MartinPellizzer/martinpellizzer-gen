    "intro": "Davallia hallbergii, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are covered with a dense layer of fine, golden hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the substrate. The fronds are evergreen, maintaining their color throughout the year, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
