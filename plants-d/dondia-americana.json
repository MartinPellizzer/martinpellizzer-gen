    "intro": "Dondia americana, commonly known as the American dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true roots and chlorophyll. It attaches itself to host plants through specialized structures called haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a slender, creeping stem. It is native to North America and often found in disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it can negatively impact the growth of the plants it parasitizes."
