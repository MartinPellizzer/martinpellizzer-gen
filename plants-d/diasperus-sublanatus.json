    "intro": "Diasperus sublanatus, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, waxy hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. Its succulent leaves help it store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Diasperus sublanatus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high sunlight exposure."
