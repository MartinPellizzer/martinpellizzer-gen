    "intro": "Dorstenia schulzii, commonly known as the Schultze's false arum, is a herbaceous plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Dorstenia schulzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
