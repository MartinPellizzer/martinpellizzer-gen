    "intro": "Dracula andreettae, commonly known as the Andreetta's vampire orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its dark, velvety petals and a unique, elongated labellum that resembles a bat's face, contributing to its mysterious appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Its flowers are typically pale pink to reddish in color, and it blooms infrequently, making it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Dracula andreettae is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and over-collection."
