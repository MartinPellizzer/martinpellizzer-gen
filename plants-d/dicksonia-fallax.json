    "intro": "Dicksonia fallax, commonly known as the mountain tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, hollow stem covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rhyzome. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a long, narrow shape and a silvery underside. Dicksonia fallax thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with high humidity."
