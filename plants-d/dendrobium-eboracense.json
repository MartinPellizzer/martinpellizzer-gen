    "intro": "Dendrobium eboracense, commonly known as the Eboracense Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a tall, branched stem with numerous pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Dendrobium eboracense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
