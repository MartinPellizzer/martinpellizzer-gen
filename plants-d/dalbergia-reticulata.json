    "intro": "Dalbergia reticulata, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The tree produces a distinctive, dark reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its density and fine grain. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
