    "intro": "Dryopteris matsumurae, commonly known as the Matsumura's wood fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a membranous indusium."
