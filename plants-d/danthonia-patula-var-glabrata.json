    "intro": "Danthonia patula var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth danthonia, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
