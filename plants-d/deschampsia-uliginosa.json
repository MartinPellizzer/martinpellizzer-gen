    "intro": "Deschampsia uliginosa, commonly known as bog grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to saturated soils, often found in bogs, fens, and marshes. The plant has slender, hairless stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
