    "intro": "Dendrophylax varius, commonly known as the variable orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in pine flatwoods and wetlands. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it has a rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in wet environments. This species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
