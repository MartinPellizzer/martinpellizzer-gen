    "intro": "Dissiliaria indistincta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. It has a short, creeping rhizome and produces erect flowering stems that are typically less than 30 cm in height. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
