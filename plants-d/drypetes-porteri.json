    "intro": "Drypetes porteri, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its attractive wood and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
