    "intro": "Dryopteris obliquata, commonly known as the oblique wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of Asia, North America, and Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
