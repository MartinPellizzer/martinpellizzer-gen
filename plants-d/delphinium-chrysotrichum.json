    "intro": "Delphinium chrysotrichum, commonly known as the golden hair vane larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers arranged in racemes, with distinctive golden bracts beneath the flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, contributing to its rugged appearance. Delphinium chrysotrichum thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
