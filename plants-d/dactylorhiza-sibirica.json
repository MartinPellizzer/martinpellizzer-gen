    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to cold climates of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and heaths. The plant has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with three petals and three sepals, forming a distinctive orchid shape. Dactylorhiza sibirica is known for its ability to survive harsh winters, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
