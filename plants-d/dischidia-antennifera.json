It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its aerial roots and dense, foliage that often forms a curtain-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, fig-like fruits. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a waxy texture. Dischidia antennifera is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid environments."
