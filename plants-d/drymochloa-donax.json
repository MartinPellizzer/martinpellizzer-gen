    "intro": "Drymochloa donax, commonly known as the giant bamboo or giant reed, is a tall, grass-like plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, clumping habit. It thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found near water bodies. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can become invasive in certain regions."
