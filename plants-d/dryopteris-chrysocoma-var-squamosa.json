    "intro": "Dryopteris chrysocoma var. squamosa, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a variant of the golden shield fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, triangular, and often golden-yellow fronds that are covered in a dense layer of pale, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests and high-altitude areas. Its fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, upright growth habit. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and light conditions."
