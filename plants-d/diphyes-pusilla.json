    "intro": "Diphyes pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various coniferous trees. It has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, white or pink berries that are toxic to animals. The plant relies on its host for nutrients and water, often causing stress or damage to the host tree. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species. Its life cycle involves both a seed and a root-like structure called a haustorium that attaches to the host."
