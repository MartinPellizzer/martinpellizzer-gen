    "intro": "Dryopteris plaschnickiana, commonly known as the Plaschnick's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, dark green fronds with a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sporangia that are clustered in sori."
