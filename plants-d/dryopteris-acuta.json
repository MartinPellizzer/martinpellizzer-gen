    "intro": "Dryopteris acuta, commonly known as the acute female fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The plant's rhizome is fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine."
