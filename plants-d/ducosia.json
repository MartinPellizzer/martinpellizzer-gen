The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, bark that can vary in color depending on the species. Its leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a glossy surface and a pointed tip. Ducosia flowers are small and fragrant, often appearing in clusters, and the plant produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind."
