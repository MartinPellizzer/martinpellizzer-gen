    "intro": "Dendrobium alderwereltianum, commonly known as the Alderwerelt's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical climates. Its flowers are typically showy, with a range of colors from white to pink, and are often fragrant. It thrives in high humidity and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
