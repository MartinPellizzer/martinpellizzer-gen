    "intro": "Dorcoceras, commonly known as the sea hare, is a marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Aplysiidae. It is characterized by its soft, fleshy body and a distinctive, often brightly colored mantle that can resemble a sea hare. Dorcoceras species are typically found in tropical and temperate coastal waters, where they graze on algae and other marine plants. Their anatomy includes a radula for feeding and a specialized respiratory system adapted to aquatic life. These organisms play an important role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for various marine predators."
