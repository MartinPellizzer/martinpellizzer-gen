    "intro": "Desmodium ghiesbreghtii, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in disturbed soils. Desmodium ghiesbreghtii is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural systems."
