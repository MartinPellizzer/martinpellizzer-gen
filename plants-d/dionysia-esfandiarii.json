    "intro": "Dionysia esfandiarii, commonly known as the Persian wine flower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Dionysia esfandiarii is adapted to arid and rocky environments, showcasing a compact growth habit and hairy foliage to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
