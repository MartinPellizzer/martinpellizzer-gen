    "intro": "Dahlia tamaulipana, commonly known as the Tamaulipan dahlia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Tamaulipan wetlands of southern Texas and northeastern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, single or double flowers that range in color from red to orange, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its tuberous roots are an important adaptation for surviving in the wetland environment. The flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
