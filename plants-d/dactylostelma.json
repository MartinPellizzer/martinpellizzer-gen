    "intro": "Dactylostelma, commonly known as the velvetleaf or horseweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular leaves and showy yellow flowers that typically bloom in the summer. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Dactylostelma species are often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
