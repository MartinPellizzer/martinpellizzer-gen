    "intro": "Drapetes multiflora, commonly known as the mountain flax, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist conditions. Drapetes multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
