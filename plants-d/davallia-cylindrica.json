It features slender, upright rhizomes and produces small, spindle-shaped spore-bearing structures called sorus. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a delicate, feathery appearance that gives it a graceful look. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The plant is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
