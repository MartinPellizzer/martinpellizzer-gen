    "intro": "Dupontia pelligera, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Dupontia pelligera plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
