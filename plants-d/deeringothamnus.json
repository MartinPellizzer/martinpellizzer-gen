    "intro": "Deeringothamnus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features a compact, mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Deeringothamnus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
