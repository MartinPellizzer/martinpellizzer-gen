    "intro": "Desmodium molle, commonly known as hairy beggar's ticks, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Desmodium molle is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
