    "intro": "Dichaea elvirae, commonly known as the Elvirae's air plant, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in dense clusters of small, dark green leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Dichaea elvirae is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
