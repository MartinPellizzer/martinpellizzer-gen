    "intro": "Desmodium nemorosum, commonly known as the woodland morning glory, is a perennial legume native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pale violet to blue flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, thriving in partial shade. It has a sprawling growth habit and produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. As a legume, it has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
