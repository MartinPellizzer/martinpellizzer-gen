It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and lanceolate leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody, oblong fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas.
