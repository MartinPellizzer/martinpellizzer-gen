It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and forested areas. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies due to their nectar-rich structure.
