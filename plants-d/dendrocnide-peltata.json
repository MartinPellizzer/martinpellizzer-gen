    "intro": "Dendrocnide peltata, commonly known as stinging tree, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, spiky fruits. One of its most notable features is its toxic sap, which contains histamine-like compounds that cause severe skin irritation. This plant is also known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests and along creeklines."
