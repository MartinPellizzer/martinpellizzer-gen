    "intro": "Dissotis glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular dissotis, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with showy, often pink or white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered with glandular hairs, which contribute to its common name. Dissotis glandulosa is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and floral display."
