    "intro": "Dryopteris falciloba, commonly known as the sickle fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped fronds that are often deeply divided, giving it a distinctive, delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Dryopteris falciloba is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens."
