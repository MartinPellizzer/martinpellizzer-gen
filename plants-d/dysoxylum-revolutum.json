    "intro": "Dysoxylum revolutum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with opposite arrangement and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are borne in clusters. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release flat, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, Dysoxylum revolutum is now considered endangered in many parts of its natural range."
