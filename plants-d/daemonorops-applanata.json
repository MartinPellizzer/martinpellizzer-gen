    "intro": "Daemonorops applanata, commonly known as the flat-leaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
