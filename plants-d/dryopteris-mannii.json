It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually divided into segments, giving the plant a distinctive and ornamental appearance."
