    "intro": "Duranta pearcei, commonly known as the silverleaf duranta, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 feet tall, featuring lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery-gray pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that transition from white to yellow as they mature. These flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
