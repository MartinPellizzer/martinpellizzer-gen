    "intro": "Delostoma stenolobium, commonly known as the narrow-lobed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its stems may be partially exposed. Delostoma stenolobium is known for its unique adaptation to nutrient-poor environments by capturing and digesting prey."
