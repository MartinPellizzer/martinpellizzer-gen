    "intro": "Dryopteris papilio, commonly known as the purple fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green to purple in color, especially when young. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it can anchor itself to rocks or soil. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies over time. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
