It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its leaves are usually long and narrow, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in its natural habitat. Dendrobium pentactis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in traditional medicine."
