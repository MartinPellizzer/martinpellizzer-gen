    "intro": "Dryopteris gushanica, commonly known as the Gushan Shield Fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to China. It is characterized by its medium-sized, upright fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a hymenium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. The Gushan Shield Fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
