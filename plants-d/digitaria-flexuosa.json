    "intro": "Digitaria flexuosa, commonly known as weeping grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its drooping, arching inflorescences that give it a weeping appearance. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along waterways. Digitaria flexuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet environments."
