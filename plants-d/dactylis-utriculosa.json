    "intro": "Dactylis utriculosa, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fine-textured foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth allows it to form extensive mats, making it a valuable forage plant. Dactylis utriculosa is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides."
