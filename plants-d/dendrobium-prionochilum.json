    "intro": "Dendrobium prionochilum, commonly known as the golden torch orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, thin stems that are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are striking, with bright yellow petals and a distinctive, elongated lip that resembles a torch. Dendrobium prionochilum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
