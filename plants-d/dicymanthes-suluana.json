    "intro": "Dicymanthes suluana, commonly known as the Sulu star orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Sulu Archipelago in the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found on trees in humid, tropical environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it thrives in shaded, well-drained conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
