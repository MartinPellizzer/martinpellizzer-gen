    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudoamboinensis, commonly known as the Amboina shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
