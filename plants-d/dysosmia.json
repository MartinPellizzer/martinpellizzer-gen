    "intro": "Dysosmia, commonly known as a distorted sense of smell, is a condition characterized by an altered perception of odors. It can manifest as a reduced sense of smell, an altered perception of familiar scents, or the perception of odors that are not actually present. This condition may be caused by nasal congestion, infections, neurological disorders, or exposure to certain chemicals. Botanically, it is not a plant but a medical condition related to the olfactory system. Dysosmia can significantly impact a person's quality of life and may require medical evaluation to determine the underlying cause."
