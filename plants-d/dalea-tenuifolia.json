    "intro": "Dalea tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with multiple small leaflets, and it produces seed pods that split open to release its tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Dalea tenuifolia is often found in grasslands, open woodlands, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
