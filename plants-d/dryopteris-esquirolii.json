    "intro": "Dryopteris esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its mature leaves. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Dryopteris esquirolii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
