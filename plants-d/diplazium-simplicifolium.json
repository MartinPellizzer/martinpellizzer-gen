    "intro": "Diplazium simplicifolium, commonly known as the simple-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are adapted for efficient water movement and light absorption. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Diplazium simplicifolium is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in water gardens."
