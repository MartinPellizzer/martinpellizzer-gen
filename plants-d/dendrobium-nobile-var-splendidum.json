    "intro": "Dendrobium nobile var. splendidum, commonly known as the splendid orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features long, cane-like stems that bear clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that help in photosynthesis and moisture retention. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beautiful, long-lasting blooms."
