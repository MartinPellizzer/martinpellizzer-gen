    "intro": "Dendrobium subclausum var. pandanicola, commonly known as the pandan leaf orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, long, and often pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is an epiphyte, typically growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and leathery, often resembling the texture and color of pandan leaves, hence its common name. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is highly sought after by horticulturists and conservationists alike."
