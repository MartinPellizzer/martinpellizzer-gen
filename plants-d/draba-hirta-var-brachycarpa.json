    "intro": "Draba hirta var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-seeded wallflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its compact growth form and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions make it well adapted to its native range. The variety brachycarpa is distinguished by its shorter, more rounded fruiting structures compared to other varieties of Draba hirta."
