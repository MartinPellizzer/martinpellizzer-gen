    "intro": "Dendrobium odontopus, commonly known as the toothed dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in tropical and subtropical environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers with prominent, tooth-like markings on the petals. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements make it a favored ornamental plant among orchid enthusiasts."
