It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy surface. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
