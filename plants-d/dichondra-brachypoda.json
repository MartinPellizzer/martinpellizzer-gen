    "intro": "Dichondra brachypoda, commonly known as silverleaf dichondra, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Dichondra brachypoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
