    "intro": "Dissotis decumbens, commonly known as the creeping bluetail, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in wet, shady environments such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant has prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its small, blue to violet flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are oval-shaped with a waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture in humid conditions."
