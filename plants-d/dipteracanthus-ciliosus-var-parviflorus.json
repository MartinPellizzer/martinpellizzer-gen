    "intro": "Dipteracanthus ciliosus var. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered dipteracanthus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped with finely serrated edges, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
