    "intro": "Dyckia dissitiflora var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate dyckia, is a bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white trichomes. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance in cultivation."
