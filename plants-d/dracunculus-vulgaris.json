    "intro": "Dracunculus vulgaris, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of numerous white or pink flowers. The plant has thick, hairy stems that can grow up to 5 meters in height, and its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and deeply lobed. Dracunculus vulgaris contains phototoxic compounds in its sap, which can cause severe skin irritation upon exposure to sunlight. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a noxious weed in many regions."
