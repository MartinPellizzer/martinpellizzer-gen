    "intro": "Datura carthaginensis, commonly known as the Carthaginian thornapple, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple, often with a trumpet-shaped structure. The plant produces spiny capsules that contain seeds, and its leaves are typically broad and lobed. Datura carthaginensis is part of the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of tropane alkaloids. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks."
