    "intro": "Deschampsia hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian hairgrass, is a native grass species found exclusively on the Hawaiian Islands. It is a low-growing perennial plant with fine, wiry leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in coastal dunes and wetlands. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native invertebrates. Due to its restricted range and vulnerability to invasive species, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
