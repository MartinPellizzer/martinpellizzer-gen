    "intro": "Dryopteris chiui, commonly known as the Chinese wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green and slightly serrated. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread slowly through underground growth. Dryopteris chiui is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
