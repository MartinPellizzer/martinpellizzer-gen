    "intro": "Draba hispanica var. battandieri, commonly known as the Spanish rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of about 10\u201320 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in dense, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. This variety is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, making it a common sight in mountainous regions of southern Europe."
