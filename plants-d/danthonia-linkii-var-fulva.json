    "intro": "Danthonia linkii var. fulva, commonly known as the golden danthonia, is a low-growing grass species native to parts of Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically golden to reddish in color, especially under sunlight. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in native gardens."
