    "intro": "Didymocarpus flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered dika, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
