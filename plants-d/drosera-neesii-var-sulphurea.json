    "intro": "Drosera neesii var. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden dew to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats where it can thrive on nutrient-poor soil. Its leaves are usually yellowish-green, and the flowers are small, white or greenish in color. This variety is noted for its ability to form dense mats and is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological interest."
