    "intro": "Dendrobium striolatum var. beckleri, commonly known as the Beckler's Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white or yellowish hair. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns and a sweet fragrance. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking appearance and resilience."
