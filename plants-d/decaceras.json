It is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features striking blue or purple flower heads surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in saline environments.
