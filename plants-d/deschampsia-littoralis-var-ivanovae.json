    "intro": "Deschampsia littoralis var. ivanovae, commonly known as the coastal hairgrass, is a variant of the coastal hairgrass species native to the rocky shores of the Pacific Northwest. It is a low-growing, mat-forming grass that thrives in saline, wind-swept environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This variant is often found in intertidal zones and is an important part of the coastal ecosystem."
