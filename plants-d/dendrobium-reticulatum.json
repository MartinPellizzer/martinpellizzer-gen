    "intro": "Dendrobium reticulatum, commonly known as the netted dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a branching stem system with numerous pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Dendrobium reticulatum produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often blooming in clusters."
