It features small, round, silvery-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ground cover in rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ability to tolerate salt spray makes it particularly suitable for seaside environments."
