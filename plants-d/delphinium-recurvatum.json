    "intro": "Delphinium recurvatum, commonly known as the Himalayan larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, often with a bluish-green hue. Delphinium recurvatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
