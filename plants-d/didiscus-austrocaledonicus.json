    "intro": "Didiscus austrocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonia didiscus, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying endemic flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes."
