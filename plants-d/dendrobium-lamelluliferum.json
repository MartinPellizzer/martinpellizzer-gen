    "intro": "Dendrobium lamelluliferum, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a distinctive lip that is broader than the rest of the petals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium lamelluliferum is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
