It is a perennial fern that thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in mountainous regions. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a bright yellow hue on the underside, which gives it its common name. It has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
