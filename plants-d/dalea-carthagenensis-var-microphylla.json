    "intro": "Dalea carthagenensis var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved prairie clover, is a perennial herb native to the central United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small leaflets that are often hairy. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration projects."
