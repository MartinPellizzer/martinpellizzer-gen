    "intro": "Dicranolepis speciosa, commonly known as the showy rock fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dicranolepis speciosa plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
