    "intro": "Daucus leptophyllus, commonly known as the slenderleaf carrot, is a species of flowering plant in theApiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in umbels. Native to the western United States, particularly California, it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, edible roots similar to those of the common carrot, though it is less cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
