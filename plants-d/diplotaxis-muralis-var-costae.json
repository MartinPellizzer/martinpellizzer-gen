It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a distinctive serrated edge, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
