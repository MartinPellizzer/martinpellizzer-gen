    "intro": "Duvallia, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. These succulent plants are native to various regions in the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. Duvallia species are characterized by their fleshy, often thick leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. They are typically drought-tolerant and thrive in well-drained soil, making them suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Many species are also popular as indoor plants due to their low maintenance requirements."
