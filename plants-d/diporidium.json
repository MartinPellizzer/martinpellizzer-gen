It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring two distinct lobes on the lip, which is a distinguishing botanical trait. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring moist, shaded environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in humid soils. Botanically, Diporidium is noted for its small, delicate flowers and its role in local ecosystems as a pollinator attractant."
