    "intro": "Dipterocarpus cornutus, commonly known as the horned dipterocarp, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its sturdy, straight trunk and thick, flaky bark. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that are typically borne in clusters, and it relies on insects and birds for pollination. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release seeds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems. The tree is valued for its timber and is often found in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests."
