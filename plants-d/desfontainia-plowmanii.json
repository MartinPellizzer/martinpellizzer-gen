    "intro": "Desfontainia plowmanii, commonly known as the Plowman's desfontainia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Its botanical features include narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a hairy stem, which help it adapt to its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
