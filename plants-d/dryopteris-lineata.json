    "intro": "Dryopteris lineata, commonly known as the marginal shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive white margin that contrasts with its dark green color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense carpet of foliage. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth."
