    "intro": "Drynaria parishii, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. Drynaria parishii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
