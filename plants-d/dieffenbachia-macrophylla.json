    "intro": "Dieffenbachia macrophylla, commonly known as the Leopard Plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often marked with white or yellow veins, giving it a striking appearance. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, which includes other ornamental plants like peace lilies and calla lilies. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dieffenbachia macrophylla is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
