It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
