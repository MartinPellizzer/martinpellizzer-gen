It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture. Digitaria elegans is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
