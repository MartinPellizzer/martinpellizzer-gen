    "intro": "Daphne prostrata, commonly known as the creeping daphne, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery, dark green leaves that are arranged in a tight, mat-like formation. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of pink, white, and lilac, which bloom in early spring. Its ornamental value comes from its glossy foliage and showy blooms, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground covers. Daphne prostrata prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
