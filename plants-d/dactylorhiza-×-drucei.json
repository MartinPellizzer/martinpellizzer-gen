    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 drucei, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pale pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Dactylorhiza \u00d7 drucei is a perennial herb that plays an important ecological role in its native wetland environments."
