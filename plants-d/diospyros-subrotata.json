    "intro": "Diospyros subrotata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, dark purple berries. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
