    "intro": "Dysoxylum testaceum, commonly known as the yellow mangosteen, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that give way to round, green fruits with a thick, leathery rind. The fruit contains a single seed and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
