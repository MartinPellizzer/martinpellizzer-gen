    "intro": "Durringtonia paludosa, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in wetland habitats. It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in peat bogs and other waterlogged soils, where it forms dense mats. Its flowers, which are usually pale green or yellowish, bloom in late summer and early autumn. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Durringtonia paludosa is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
