    "intro": "Duguetia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leafed bignay, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, often with a waxy surface and prominent veins. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round fruits resembling small apples. The fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, sweet pulp, making it valuable both for its ornamental value and its use in local cuisines. It is often cultivated in home gardens and agroforestry systems due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
