    "intro": "Diplotaxis kohlaanensis, commonly known as the Khorasan mustard, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and broccoli. The plant is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Its leaves are pinnately lobed, and it produces small, round pods that contain several seeds. Diplotaxis kohlaanensis is adapted to dry environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
