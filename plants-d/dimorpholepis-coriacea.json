    "intro": "Dimorpholepis coriacea, commonly known as the rough bark tree, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. Dimorpholepis coriacea is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is adapted to arid conditions."
