    "intro": "Desmidorchis foetida, commonly known as the stinking orchid, is a rare and unusual orchid species native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, often foul-smelling flowers that emit a strong odor, which is thought to attract specific pollinators. The plant has a unique morphology, with long, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a reddish tint, and they bloom during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
