    "intro": "Dupatya puberula, commonly known as the hairy leaf fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The botanical features of Dupatya puberula make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
