    "intro": "Dactylorhiza urvilleana subsp. bithynica, commonly known as the Bithynian marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, preferring moist, acidic soils. The plant produces erect, hairy stems with several lance-shaped leaves and bears pale yellow to greenish flowers with a distinctive lip. Its roots are specialized for mycorrhizal associations, which aid in nutrient absorption. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland habitats."
