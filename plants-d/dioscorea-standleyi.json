    "intro": "Dioscorea standleyi, commonly known as the African yam bean, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, tuberous roots, which are its economically important part. These tubers are edible and have been traditionally used as a food source in various African countries. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
