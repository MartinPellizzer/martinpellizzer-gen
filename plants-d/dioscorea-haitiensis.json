    "intro": "Dioscorea haitiensis, commonly known as Haitian yam, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean, particularly Haiti. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, green, heart-shaped leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its tubers are typically harvested when mature, and they have a starchy, somewhat bitter taste. Due to its unique properties, it holds cultural and economic significance in the regions where it is found."
