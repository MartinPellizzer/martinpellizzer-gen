    "intro": "Dracula roethiana, commonly known as the Dragon's Blood Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its dark red to purple flowers, which resemble blood, giving it its dramatic common name. The plant has a unique structure with a short, thick rhizome and fleshy, dark green leaves. It blooms during the rainy season, typically between April and June. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Dracula roethiana is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
