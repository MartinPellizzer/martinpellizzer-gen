It features trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or white. The plant is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers also make it a suitable candidate for ornamental landscaping."
