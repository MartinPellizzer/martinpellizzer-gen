    "intro": "Dennstaedtia obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically broad and obtuse at the tips. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
