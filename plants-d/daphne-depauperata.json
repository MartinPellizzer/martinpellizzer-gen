    "intro": "Daphne depauperata, commonly known as the poor man's daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant flowers that range from white to pink, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its compact size and ornamental appeal. Daphne depauperata is relatively low maintenance but requires well-drained soil to thrive."
