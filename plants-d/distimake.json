    "intro": "Distimake, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying entirely on its roots for sustenance. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Distimake thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in pine flatwoods or along the edges of swamps. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
