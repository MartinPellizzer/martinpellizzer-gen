    "intro": "Davallia attenuata, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, with curled, overlapping leaves that create a protective structure for its spores. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate, while its fronds are typically dark green with a leathery texture. Davallia attenuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
