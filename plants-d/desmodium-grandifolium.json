    "intro": "Desmodium grandifolium, commonly known as large-leaf burr legume, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often large and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Desmodium grandifolium is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
