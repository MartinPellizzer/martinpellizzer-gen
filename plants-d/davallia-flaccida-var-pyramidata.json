    "intro": "Davallia flaccida var. pyramidata, commonly known as the bamboo fern, is a compact, clumping fern that forms dense, upright clumps of narrow, arching fronds. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, bamboo-like appearance, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and moderate watering. The varietal form, pyramidata, is characterized by its more compact growth habit compared to the standard Davallia flaccida."
