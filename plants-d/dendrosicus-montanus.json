    "intro": "Dendrosicus montanus, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a species of coniferous tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, needle-like foliage that provides year-round coverage. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its root system is adapted to anchor it in rocky, nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh mountain environments. The plant plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
