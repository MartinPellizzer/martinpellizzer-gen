It is characterized by its unique, spiraling leaves that resemble the shape of an arrowhead, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in panicles. Native to the tropical regions of Central America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a sought-after specimen for collectors and botanists interested in its morphological adaptations."
