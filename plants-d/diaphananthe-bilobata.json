    "intro": "Diaphananthe bilobata, commonly known as the two-lobed sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, cushion-like form with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its small, white or pale blue flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming during the cooler months. Diaphananthe bilobata is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
