    "intro": "Draba subcapitata f. glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, basal leaves that are typically hairless, giving it its \"glabrata\" designation. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, flowering stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its compact growth and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
