It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Diplodium revolutum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its fibrous roots and resilient nature make it an important plant in its native ecosystem."
