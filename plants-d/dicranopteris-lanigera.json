    "intro": "Dicranopteris lanigera, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture and a deep green color."
