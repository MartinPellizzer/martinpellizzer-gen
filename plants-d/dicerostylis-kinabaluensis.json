    "intro": "Dicerostylis kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu dicerostylis, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the high elevations of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its unique, clustered inflorescence and delicate, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats within the montane rainforest ecosystem. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are slender and erect. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
