    "intro": "Dracaena bequaertii, commonly known as the Madagascar dragon tree, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It features a thick, upright stem with a swollen base that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight sheen, and it thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Dracaena bequaertii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
