    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 pseudoabbreviata, commonly known as the false barren blade fern, is a hybrid fern that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Dryopteris abbreviata and Dryopteris intermedia. It is a deciduous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a leathery texture. It produces spores in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, dense foliage."
