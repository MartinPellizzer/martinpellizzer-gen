    "intro": "Dichotoma coffeaecola, commonly known as the coffee-colored dichotoma, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal parts. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a glossy surface with a slightly serrated edge. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments."
