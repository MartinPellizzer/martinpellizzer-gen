    "intro": "Diasperus sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is adapted to grow in coastal sand dunes and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for native insects. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
