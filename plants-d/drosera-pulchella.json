    "intro": "Drosera pulchella, commonly known as the pink sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its flowers are usually pink or red, and it blooms during the cooler months. Drosera pulchella is a low-growing plant that thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils."
