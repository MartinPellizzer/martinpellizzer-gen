    "intro": "Dissochaeta vacillans, commonly known as the wavering hairplant, is a species of liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that often appear in a rosette formation. The plant's thallus is typically green or yellowish-green, and it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense. It reproduces via spores, which are released from capsules that develop on the plant's surface. Dissochaeta vacillans is often found growing on rock surfaces or in damp soil, thriving in cool and humid conditions."
