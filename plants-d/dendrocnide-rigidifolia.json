    "intro": "Dendrocnide rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid leaf stinging tree, is a shrub native to northern Australia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its stinging hairs that can cause severe skin irritation. The plant typically grows in coastal heathlands and has dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters, and it produces hairy, woody fruits. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by both humans and animals."
