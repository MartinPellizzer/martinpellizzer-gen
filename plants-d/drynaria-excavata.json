    "intro": "Drynaria excavata, commonly known as the hollow fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hollow, and often segmented rhizome, which gives it its common name. The plant produces erect, branched fronds with a leathery texture and a serrated margin. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Drynaria excavata is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
