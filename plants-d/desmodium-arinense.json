    "intro": "Desmodium arinense, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by flat, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland areas. Desmodium arinense is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural systems."
