    "intro": "Diaperia prolifera, commonly known as the common diaperwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Diaperia prolifera is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain habitats."
