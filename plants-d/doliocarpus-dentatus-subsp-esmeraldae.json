It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and mango, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, serrated leaves and yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible and often consumed by local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
