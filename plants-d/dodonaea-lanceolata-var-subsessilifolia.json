It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, bead-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal and dryland environments. Its foliage and floral structure contribute to its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
