    "intro": "Dryopteris subhikonensis, commonly known as the Subhikona wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, often arching growth habit. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are thick and short, allowing it to anchor firmly in the soil while supporting the growth of its delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in humid, temperate climates."
