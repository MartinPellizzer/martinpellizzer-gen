    "intro": "Decodon verticillatus var. laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth false water plantain, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water or moist soil. This variety is distinguished by its smoother leaf surfaces compared to other varieties of Decodon verticillatus."
