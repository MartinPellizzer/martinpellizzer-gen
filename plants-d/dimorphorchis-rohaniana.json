    "intro": "Dimorphorchis rohaniana, commonly known as the Rohan's orchid, is a rare and exquisite epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its strikingly beautiful, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its aerial roots while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to their rarity and ornamental value. However, due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is now classified as endangered."
