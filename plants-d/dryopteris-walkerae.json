    "intro": "Dryopteris walkerae, commonly known as the Walkera's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, slender fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
