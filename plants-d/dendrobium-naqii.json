It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without being parasitic. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs covered in dense, leathery leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, fragrant scent. Dendrobium naqii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
