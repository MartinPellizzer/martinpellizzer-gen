    "intro": "Dicrocaulon pearsonii, commonly known as the pearson's dicrocaulon, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks or in dense forests. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in a head. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
