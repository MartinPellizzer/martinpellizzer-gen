    "intro": "Descurainia tanacetifolia subsp. tanacetifolia, commonly known as golden mustache, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that resemble a mustache, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are arranged in racemes, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in arid garden settings."
