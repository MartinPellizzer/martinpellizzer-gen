    "intro": "Danthonia barbata, commonly known as the hairy oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear a dense covering of short, stiff hairs. The leaves are narrow, flat, and typically have a bluish-green color, while the inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed areas. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
