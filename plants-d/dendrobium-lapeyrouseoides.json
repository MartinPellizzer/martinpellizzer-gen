    "intro": "Dendrobium lapeyrouseoides, commonly known as the Lapeyrouse's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical climates. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, with a distinctive, fragrant scent. Dendrobium lapeyrouseoides is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
