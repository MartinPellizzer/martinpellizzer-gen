    "intro": "Dryopteris yandongensis, commonly known as the Yandong shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lanceolate fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are covered in a layer of specialized cells called sporangia. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
