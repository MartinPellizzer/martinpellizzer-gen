    "intro": "Delissea macrostegia, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 20 centimeters in diameter, often displaying vibrant colors such as pink, white, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical forests. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Delissea macrostegia is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting various insect pollinators."
