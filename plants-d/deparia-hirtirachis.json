    "intro": "Deparia hirtirachis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are typically dark green and covered with fine, hairy structures on the stems. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Deparia hirtirachis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
