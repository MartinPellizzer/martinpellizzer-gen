    "intro": "Dactylorhiza elata subsp. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or damp environments such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant has a slender, erect stem that can reach up to 50 cm in height, bearing several narrow, linear leaves. Its flowers are pink to purple in color, arranged in a loose spike, and are characterized by their three-lobed lip. This orchid is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other wetland plant species."
