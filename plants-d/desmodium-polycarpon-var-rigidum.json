It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow to white in color. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils, it is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides."
