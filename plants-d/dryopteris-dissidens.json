    "intro": "Dryopteris dissidens, commonly known as the serrated wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its deeply divided, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, acidic soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris dissidens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
