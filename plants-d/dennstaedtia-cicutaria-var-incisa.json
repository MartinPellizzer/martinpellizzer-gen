    "intro": "Dennstaedtia cicutaria var. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Dennstaedtia. It is a perennial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant features delicate, pinnately divided leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across wetlands and stream banks. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
