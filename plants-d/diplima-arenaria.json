    "intro": "Diplima arenaria, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It thrives in sandy soils and is well-adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in loose, nutrient-poor soils. Diplima arenaria plays a crucial role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
