    "intro": "Delphinium viscosum subsp. viscosum, commonly known as sticky delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and covered in a sticky, glandular substance. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and dry habitats, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments."
