It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by small, round fruits resembling persimmons. The fruit is typically edible when ripe, though it may have astringent properties when unripe. Diospyros paralea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its potential medicinal uses."
