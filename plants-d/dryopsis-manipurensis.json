    "intro": "Dryopsis manipurensis, commonly known as the Manipur dryops, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern region of India. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories, and is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical climates. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
