    "intro": "Dubrueilia serpyllifolia, commonly known as sheep's sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along pathways. It is known for its edible leaves, which have a slightly sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Dubrueilia serpyllifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate dry conditions."
