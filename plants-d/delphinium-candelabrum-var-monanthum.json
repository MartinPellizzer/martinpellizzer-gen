    "intro": "Delphinium candelabrum var. monanthum, commonly known as the single-flowered candelabrum larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright stem that bears a cluster of showy, blue to purple flowers at the top, resembling a candlestick. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and children."
