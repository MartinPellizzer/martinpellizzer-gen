    "intro": "Daemonorops treubiana, commonly known as the Borneo cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones instead of flowers. The plant has a tall, unbranched trunk with a smooth, grayish bark, and its leaves are pinnately compound, arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and over-collection."
