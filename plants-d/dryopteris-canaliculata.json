    "intro": "Dryopteris canaliculata, commonly known as the notched wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are stout and produce numerous roots, aiding in its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive notched appearance along the margins."
