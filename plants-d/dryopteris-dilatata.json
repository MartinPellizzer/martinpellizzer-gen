    "intro": "Dryopteris dilatata, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night due to the presence of luciferin and luciferase enzymes."
