    "intro": "Dryopteris hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian wood fern, is a rare fern species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile ones in the second. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas and mesic forests. It has small, spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its unique botanical characteristics."
