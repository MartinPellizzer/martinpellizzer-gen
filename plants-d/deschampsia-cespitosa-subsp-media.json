    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa subsp. media, commonly known as intermediate tussock grass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically green to purplish in color, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as wet meadows and pond edges. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically important in wetland habitats."
