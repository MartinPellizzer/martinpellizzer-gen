    "intro": "Dacrydium spathoides, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and yellowish-green cones. The plant typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as kauri or pohutukawa, drawing nutrients and water from them. It plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of New Zealand's forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is protected in some regions."
