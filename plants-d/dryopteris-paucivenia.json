It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris paucivenia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
