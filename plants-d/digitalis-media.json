It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of hooded flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant contains cardiac glycosides, which have historically been used in medicine for heart conditions. Its leaves are ovate and have a velvety texture, while its flowers are tubular with two lips.
