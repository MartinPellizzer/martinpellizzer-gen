    "intro": "Dendrophthora grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It produces fleshy, red berries that are often consumed by birds, facilitating seed dispersal. Dendrophthora grandifolia is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded environments within forests."
