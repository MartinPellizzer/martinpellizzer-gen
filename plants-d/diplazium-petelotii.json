    "intro": "Diplazium petelotii, commonly known as the Petelot's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that are typically divided into pinnae. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the dry season. Diplazium petelotii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in tropical regions."
