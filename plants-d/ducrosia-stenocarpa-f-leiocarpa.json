    "intro": "Ducrosia stenocarpa f. leiocarpa, commonly known as the white-flowered ducrosia, is a rare and unique variant of the ducrosia genus. It is characterized by its distinctive white, waxy flowers that contrast sharply with its green foliage. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is native to South Africa. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
