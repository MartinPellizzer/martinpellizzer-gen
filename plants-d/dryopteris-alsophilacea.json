    "intro": "Dryopteris alsophilacea, commonly known as the alsopilic wood fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
