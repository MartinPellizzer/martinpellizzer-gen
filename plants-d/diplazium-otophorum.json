    "intro": "Diplazium otophorum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It features a rosette of soft, velvety, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clusters. Diplazium otophorum is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
