    "intro": "Disticholiparis, commonly known as the two-rowed liparid, is a genus of deep-sea fish belonging to the family Liparidae. It is characterized by its elongated, eel-like body and the presence of two rows of small, cycloid scales. These fish typically inhabit cold, deep waters and are often found near the ocean floor. Disticholiparis species are known for their unique adaptations to high-pressure and low-light environments. Their diet mainly consists of small invertebrates, and they play a role in the deep-sea food web."
