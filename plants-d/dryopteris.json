    "intro": "Dryopteris, commonly known as the shield fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments resembling shields, hence their common name. Dryopteris species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. They have a rhizomatous growth habit, with underground stems that produce new shoots and roots. Many species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
