    "intro": "Dendrobium comptonii, commonly known as the Compton's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, cane-like growth habit with dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in summer, producing white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, narrow lip. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Dendrobium comptonii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
