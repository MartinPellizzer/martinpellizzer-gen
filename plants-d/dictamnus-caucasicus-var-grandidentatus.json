    "intro": "Dictamnus caucasicus var. grandidentatus, commonly known as the Caucasian dictamnus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It features aromatic, glandular leaves that emit a strong, spicy scent when crushed. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are followed by distinctive, fragrant, pinkish-red seed pods. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded woodlands. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses in the region."
