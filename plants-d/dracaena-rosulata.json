    "intro": "Dracaena rosulata, commonly known as the \"Rosette Dracaena,\" is a striking tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique rosette-shaped arrangement of dark green, fleshy leaves that form a compact, almost tree-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Dracaena rosulata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and as a statement plant in landscaped settings."
