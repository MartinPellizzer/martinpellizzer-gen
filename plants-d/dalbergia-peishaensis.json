    "intro": "Dalbergia peishaensis, commonly known as the Chinese rosewood, is a species of legume native to China. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued in traditional furniture making. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions and has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by elongated pods containing flattened seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in its native habitat."
