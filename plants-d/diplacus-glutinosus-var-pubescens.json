    "intro": "Diplacus glutinosus var. pubescens, commonly known as the sticky monkeyflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps deter herbivores. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
