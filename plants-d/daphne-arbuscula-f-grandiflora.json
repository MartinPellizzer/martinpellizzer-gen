    "intro": "Daphne arbuscula f. grandiflora, commonly known as the grandiflora daphne, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and its ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its slow growth and cold hardiness, it is a popular choice for coastal gardens."
