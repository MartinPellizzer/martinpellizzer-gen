    "intro": "Dryopteris columbiana, commonly known as the Pacific shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to western North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-rich soil. The fronds are divided into a series of shield-shaped segments, giving the plant its distinctive appearance."
