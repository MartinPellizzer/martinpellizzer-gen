    "intro": "Damasonium angustissimum, commonly known as narrowleaf water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or wetland areas, with its leaves floating on the surface while its roots are submerged. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer. Damasonium angustissimum is characterized by its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
