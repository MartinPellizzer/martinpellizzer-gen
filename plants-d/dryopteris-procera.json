    "intro": "Dryopteris procera, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. The plant's rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies."
