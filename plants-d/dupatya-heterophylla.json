    "intro": "Dupatya heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves ranging from lanceolate to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy white seed heads. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on morphological variation in plants."
