    "intro": "Dryopteris ludens, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are covered in small, white, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the forest floor. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores in the summer."
