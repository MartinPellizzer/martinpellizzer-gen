    "intro": "Doodia media subsp. australis, commonly known as the Australian water fern, is a perennial fern native to Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and have a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in swampy areas. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes help it spread and form dense colonies. This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in wetland habitats."
