    "intro": "Decaloba biflora var. major, commonly known as the giant decaloba, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, and its showy, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow to cream-colored flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in cloud forests or mountainous regions. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires protection to ensure its survival."
