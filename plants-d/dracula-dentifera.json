    "intro": "Dracula dentifera, commonly known as the vampire's tooth, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its dark, velvety foliage and its unique, elongated, fleshy flowers that resemble teeth. The plant thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, typically growing at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its flowers are usually a deep red or maroon color, which adds to its dramatic appearance. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, Dracula dentifera is considered an endangered species."
