    "intro": "Dicksonia globulifera, commonly known as the globular tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces distinctive, spherical spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered at the ends of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Dicksonia globulifera plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various organisms."
