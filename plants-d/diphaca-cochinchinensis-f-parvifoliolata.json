    "intro": "Diphaca cochinchinensis f. parvifoliolata, commonly known as the small-leaved broadleaf tree, is a rare variant of the Diphaca cochinchinensis species. It is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Vietnam and Cambodia. The plant is characterized by its smaller, more delicate leaves compared to the typical form of the species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within tropical and subtropical forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
