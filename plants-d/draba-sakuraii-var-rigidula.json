It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
