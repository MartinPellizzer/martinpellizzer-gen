    "intro": "Deschampsia australis, commonly known as the Southern Hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to southern South America. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as wetlands and meadows. The plant features slender, tufted stems with fine, thread-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, hairy texture. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. Deschampsia australis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
