    "intro": "Danthonia intermedia var. cusickii, commonly known as the Cusick's tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, tufted growth habit with fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that bears small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
