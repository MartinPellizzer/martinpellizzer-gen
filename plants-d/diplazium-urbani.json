    "intro": "Diplazium urbani, commonly known as the urban staghorn fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptability. It is a terrestrial fern with a distinctive, tree-like appearance, featuring a thick, creeping rhizome that supports a dense rosette of fronds. The plant produces two types of spores: homosporous and heterosporous, which contribute to its reproductive versatility. Its leaves are typically lanceolate and covered with a layer of fine, silky hairs, aiding in moisture retention. Diplazium urbani thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions."
