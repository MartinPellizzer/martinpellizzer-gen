    "intro": "Dianthus wimmeri, commonly known as the Wimmer's carnation, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bicolor flowers. The plant typically produces vibrant pink or red petals with white or yellow centers, arranged in a delicate, clustered formation. Dianthus wimmeri thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early summer."
