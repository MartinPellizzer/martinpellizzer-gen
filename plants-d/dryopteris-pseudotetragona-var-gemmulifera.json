    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudotetragona var. gemmulifera, commonly known as the gemmule-bearing wood fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf wood fern. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, somewhat triangular shape. The plant produces gemmae, which are small, vegetative propagules that allow for asexual reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of fern morphology and propagation."
