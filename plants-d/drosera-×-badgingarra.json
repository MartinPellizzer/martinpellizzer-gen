    "intro": "Drosera \u00d7 badgingarra, commonly known as the Badgingarra Sundew, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme to trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of dew-like secretions. Drosera \u00d7 badgingarra is valued for its unique appearance and ecological role in nutrient-poor soils."
