It is characterized by its short, thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in white or pale blue spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for desert gardens. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
