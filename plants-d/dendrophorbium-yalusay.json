    "intro": "Dendrophorbium yalusay, commonly known as the Yalusay orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
