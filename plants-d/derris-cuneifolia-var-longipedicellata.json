    "intro": "Derris cuneifolia var. longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-stemmed arrowroot plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound leaves with elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, followed by distinctive, woody, spindle-shaped fruits. Its roots are valued for their starchy content, which is used to make a flour-like substance. The species is also noted for containing toxic alkaloids, requiring careful handling during cultivation and processing."
