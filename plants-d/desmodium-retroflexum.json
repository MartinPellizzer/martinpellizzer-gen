    "intro": "Desmodium retroflexum, commonly known as the small-flowered burr legume, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain several seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
