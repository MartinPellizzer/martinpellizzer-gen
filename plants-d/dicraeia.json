    "intro": "Dicraeia, commonly known as the mountain heather, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ericaceae. These plants are native to the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere, particularly South America and New Zealand. Dicraeia species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their evergreen leaves and dense, often fragrant foliage. They produce small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink, white, or purple, and they thrive in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to their ornamental value and ecological importance, some species are cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
