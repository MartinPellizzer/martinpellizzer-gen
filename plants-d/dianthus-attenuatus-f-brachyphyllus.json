It features small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, arranged in clusters atop short, sturdy stems. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. This cultivar is valued for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and as a bedding plant due to its vibrant blooms and compact growth habit."
