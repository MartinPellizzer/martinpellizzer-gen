    "intro": "Dryopteris micans, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its fronds are typically biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile ones in the second. The spores are produced on the underside of the fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
