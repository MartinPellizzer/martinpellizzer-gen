    "intro": "Dalbergia hullettii, commonly known as the Hullett's African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and commercial properties. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas across its native range. Due to its ornamental value and timber quality, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
