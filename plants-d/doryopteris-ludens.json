    "intro": "Doryopteris ludens, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright yellow to golden green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Doryopteris ludens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
