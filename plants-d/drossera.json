These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often appear to be ethereal or ghostly in appearance. Drossera species are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. They produce capsules as their fruit, which contain numerous tiny seeds. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique floral displays."
