    "intro": "Dryopteris sorbifolia, commonly known as the sorb tree fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its fronds are used in traditional medicine in some cultures. The plant's unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
