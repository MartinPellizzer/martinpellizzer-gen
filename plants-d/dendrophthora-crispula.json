    "intro": "Dendrophthora crispula, commonly known as the curly stem mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant has a dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are often curled or crinkled. It produces small, white or pale flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health and growth of its host trees."
