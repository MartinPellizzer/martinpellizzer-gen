    "intro": "Damnacanthus, commonly known as the sacred lotus or Indian flameflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble those of the lotus, though they are not closely related. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged opposite on the stems. Damnacanthus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and have traditional uses in herbal medicine."
