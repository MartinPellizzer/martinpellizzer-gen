    "intro": "Dendrolirium malipoense, commonly known as the Malipo lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink with a distinctive lip. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
