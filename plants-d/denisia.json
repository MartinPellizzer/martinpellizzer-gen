    "intro": "Denisia, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, showy flowers that float on the water surface, often with vibrant colors such as pink, red, or white. Denisia species typically have heart-shaped leaves that are broad and buoyant, adapted for life in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The flowers are usually bisexual, with both male and female reproductive structures, facilitating pollination by insects or wind. These plants play an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
