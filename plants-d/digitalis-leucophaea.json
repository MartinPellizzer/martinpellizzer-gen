It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear tubular flowers. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive hooded shape that resembles a foxglove. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine, though it contains toxic cardiac glycosides."
