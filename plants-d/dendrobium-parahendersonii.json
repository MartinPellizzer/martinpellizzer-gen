It is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant thrives in high humidity and bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a prized addition to orchid collections. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
