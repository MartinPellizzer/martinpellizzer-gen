    "intro": "Dichanthelium commutatum subsp. joorii, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hairy texture, and its seeds are enclosed in bristly, spiny structures. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas and is often found in grasslands and shrublands."
