    "intro": "Dicraeia wallichii var. khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones instead of flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the humid tropical and subtropical climates of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in several conservation programs."
