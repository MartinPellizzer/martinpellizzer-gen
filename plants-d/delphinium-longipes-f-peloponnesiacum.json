    "intro": "Delphinium longipes f. peloponnesiacum, commonly known as the Peloponnesian larkspur, is a rare botanical variant native to the Peloponnese region of Greece. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring striking blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive hairy texture, and its stems are often glandular and slightly woody at the base. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological characteristics."
