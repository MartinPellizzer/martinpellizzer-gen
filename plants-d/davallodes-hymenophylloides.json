    "intro": "Davallodes hymenophylloides, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, delicate fronds that resemble a fern. The plant's leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The plant's reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
