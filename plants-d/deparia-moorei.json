    "intro": "Deparia moorei, commonly known as the Moore's wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are usually short and thick, supporting the growth of its pinnate leaves. The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
