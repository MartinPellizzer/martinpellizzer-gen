    "intro": "Deppeopsis foliosa, commonly known as the broad-leafed deppeopsis, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers and related genera. The plant is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Deppeopsis foliosa is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
