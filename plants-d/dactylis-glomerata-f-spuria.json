    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata f. spuria, commonly known as the hairy cocksfoot, is a variant of the common cocksfoot grass. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the typical form of Dactylis glomerata. This grass is native to Europe and is often found in meadows and pastures. It is a perennial plant that thrives in temperate climates and is valued for its forage quality. The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers."
