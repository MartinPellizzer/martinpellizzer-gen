    "intro": "Dichanthelium ensifolium var. breve, commonly known as the short-leaved panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils, often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, bracted structures that bear the flowers. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in wetland environments and its role in stabilizing soil in such habitats."
