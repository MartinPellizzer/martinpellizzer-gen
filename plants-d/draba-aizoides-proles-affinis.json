    "intro": "Draba aizoides proles affinis, commonly known as the alpine whitlow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils at high elevations. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
