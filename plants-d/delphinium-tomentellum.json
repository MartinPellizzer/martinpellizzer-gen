    "intro": "Delphinium tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain poisonous alkaloids."
