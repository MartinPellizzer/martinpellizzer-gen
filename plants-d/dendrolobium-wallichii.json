    "intro": "Dendrolobium wallichii, commonly known as the yellow burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas and parts of South Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, temperate climates. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by woody pods containing seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. Dendrolobium wallichii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
