    "intro": "Deschampsia brevifolia var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, with fine, soft leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its structure and growth form make it well adapted to cold, harsh environments."
