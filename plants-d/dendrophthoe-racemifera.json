    "intro": "Dendrophthoe racemifera, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a hemi-parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of other plants, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are often fragrant. Its root system is specialized for penetrating the host's tissues, allowing it to extract water and minerals. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
