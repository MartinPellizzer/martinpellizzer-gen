    "intro": "Dendrobium baoernianum, commonly known as the Baoern's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to greenish-white, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or red streaks. Dendrobium baoernianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
