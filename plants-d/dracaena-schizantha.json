    "intro": "Dracaena schizantha, commonly known as the red-edged dracaena, is a member of the Asparagaceae family native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, lance-shaped leaves that are green with red or purple margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Dracaena schizantha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor environments."
