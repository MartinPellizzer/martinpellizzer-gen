    "intro": "Dryopteris decomposita, commonly known as the brittle shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often described as brittle and easily broken. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spores are dispersed through the wind. The botanical features of D. decomposita make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of its native habitats."
