    "intro": "Draba sibirica, commonly known as Siberian whitlow, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Draba sibirica is a hardy species that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
