    "intro": "Danthonia intercepta, commonly known as the narrowleaf danthonia, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairie habitats. Danthonia intercepta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
