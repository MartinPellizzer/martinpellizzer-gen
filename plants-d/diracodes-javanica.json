    "intro": "Diracodes javanica, commonly known as the Javanese fern or Javanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Diracodes javanica is often used in ornamental aquatic gardens due to its elegant appearance and ability to purify water."
