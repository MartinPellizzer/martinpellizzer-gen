It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
