    "intro": "Dyckia silvae, commonly known as the forest dyckia, is a bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating. The plant produces inflorescences that bear small, white flowers, which bloom in spring. Dyckia silvae thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its foliage is adapted to capture and store water, making it well-suited for its natural habitat."
