    "intro": "Derris praecox, commonly known as the early derris, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Leguminosae, also known as the legume or bean family. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. It produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant is notable for containing toxic compounds, particularly rotenone, which has been historically used as a natural pesticide."
