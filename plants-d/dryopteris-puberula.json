    "intro": "Dryopteris puberula, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a soft, hairy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Dryopteris puberula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
