    "intro": "Dichroa, commonly known as the evergreen dichroa, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Dichroa febrifuga, which is native to Southeast Asia. These plants are characterized by their striking, often colorful leaves that can change color depending on light conditions, giving them their name \"dichroa,\" derived from the Greek words for \"two colors.\" The leaves are typically large, palmately lobed, and can be either glossy or matte in texture. Dichroa species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in tropical and subtropical gardens."
