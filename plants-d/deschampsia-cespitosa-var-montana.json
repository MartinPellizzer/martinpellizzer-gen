    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa var. montana, commonly known as mountain bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to silver flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or disturbed areas."
