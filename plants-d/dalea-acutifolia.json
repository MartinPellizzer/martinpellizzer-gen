    "intro": "Dalea acutifolia, commonly known as the sharpleaf prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, giving it the common name \"sharpleaf,\" and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Dalea acutifolia is often used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and ecological value to pollinators."
