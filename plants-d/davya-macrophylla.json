    "intro": "Davya macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved davya, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Davya macrophylla thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments."
