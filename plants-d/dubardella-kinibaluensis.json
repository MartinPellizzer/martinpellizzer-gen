    "intro": "Dubardella kinibaluensis, commonly known as the Kinibalu bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Dubardella kinibaluensis is a relatively rare species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
