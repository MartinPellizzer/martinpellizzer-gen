    "intro": "Diplocaulobium magnilabre, commonly known as the large-labiate diplocaulobium, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces a unique fruit type called a schizocarp, which splits into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
