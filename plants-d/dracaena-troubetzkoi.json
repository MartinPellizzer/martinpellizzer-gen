    "intro": "Dracaena troubetzkoi, commonly known as the Dragon Tree, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and clusters of vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that can range in color from deep green to variegated yellow and white. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries, which are a key feature in its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
