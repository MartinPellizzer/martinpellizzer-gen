    "intro": "Daphne monnula var. vaccinium, commonly known as the common daphne, is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, compact foliage. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual contrast to its showy flowers. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
