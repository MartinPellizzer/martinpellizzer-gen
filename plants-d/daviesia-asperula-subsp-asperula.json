    "intro": "Daviesia asperula subsp. asperula, commonly known as the rough Daviesia, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are rough to the touch. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native pollinators."
