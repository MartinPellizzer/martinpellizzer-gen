    "intro": "Diplazium paucipinnum, commonly known as the slender chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and delicate, pinnately compound fronds. The fronds are typically light green, with a smooth, leathery texture and finely divided pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from sporangia located on the undersides of its fronds."
