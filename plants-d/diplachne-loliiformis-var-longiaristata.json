    "intro": "Diplachne loliiformis var. longiaristata, commonly known as the long-awned flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and riparian zones, and forms dense, rhizomatous clumps. The plant has narrow, flat leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. The variety longiaristata is distinguished by its elongated awns, which give it a distinctive appearance."
