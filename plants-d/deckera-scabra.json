    "intro": "Deckera scabra, commonly known as the roughleaf deckera, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, textured leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are followed by red berries that attract birds. Deckera scabra thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
