    "intro": "Dryopteris hirtosparsa, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, fan-like pattern. Dryopteris hirtosparsa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
