    "intro": "Doodia dissecta, commonly known as the fern with divided fronds, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are finely dissected. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it in the soil. Doodia dissecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
