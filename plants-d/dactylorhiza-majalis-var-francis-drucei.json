    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis var. francis-drucei, commonly known as the Francis-Druce's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces a single, showy spike of white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It prefers moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or heathland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
