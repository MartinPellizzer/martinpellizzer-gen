    "intro": "Delphinium \u00d7 barlowii, commonly known as the Barlow larkspur, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 6 feet in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals."
