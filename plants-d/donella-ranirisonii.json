It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique and intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the island's rainforests. Its flowers are often brightly colored, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Donella ranirisonii is considered a vulnerable species."
