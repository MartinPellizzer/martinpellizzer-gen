    "intro": "Diplazium lanceum, commonly known as the lanceleaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the water's surface. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Diplazium lanceum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
