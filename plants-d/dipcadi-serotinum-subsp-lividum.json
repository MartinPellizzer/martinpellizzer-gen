It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers in the spring. The plant's bulbs are fleshy and store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive member of the Amaryllidaceae family."
