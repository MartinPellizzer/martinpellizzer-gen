    "intro": "Drynaria, commonly known as the chain fern, is a genus of evergreen ferns belonging to the family Drynariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, upright fronds that often form dense, bushy clusters. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in shaded, moist environments. Drynaria species have rhizomatous growth, with some varieties producing spore-bearing soruses along the fronds. These ferns are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often used in horticulture and traditional medicine."
