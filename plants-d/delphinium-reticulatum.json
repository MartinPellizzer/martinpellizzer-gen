    "intro": "Delphinium reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmate leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern, which gives it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky environments. Delphinium reticulatum is noted for its ornamental value in gardens but contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
