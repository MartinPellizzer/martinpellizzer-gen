    "intro": "Desmodium handelii, commonly known as velvet bean or sickle bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow or pale green flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a slender, cylindrical pod that contains several elliptical seeds. Desmodium handelii is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agricultural systems."
