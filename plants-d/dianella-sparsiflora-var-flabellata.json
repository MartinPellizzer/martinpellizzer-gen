    "intro": "Dianella sparsiflora var. flabellata, commonly known as the broad-leaved flatleaf lily, is a striking evergreen perennial native to New Zealand. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often adorned with a distinctive blue-green hue. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense clumps over time."
