    "intro": "Dryopteris brausei, commonly known as the Brause's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is relatively rare in cultivation."
