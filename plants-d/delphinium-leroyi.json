    "intro": "Delphinium leroyi, commonly known as the Leroy's larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring tall, sparsely branched stems that are often covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and alternate along the stem, with a rough texture and prominent veins. Delphinium leroyi is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
