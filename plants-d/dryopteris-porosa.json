    "intro": "Dryopteris porosa, commonly known as the veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fertile leaves."
