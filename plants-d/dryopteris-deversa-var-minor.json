    "intro": "Dryopteris deversa var. minor, commonly known as the small-leaf wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus Dryopteris. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically shorter and more slender than those of the typical species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can access the necessary humidity and indirect light. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
