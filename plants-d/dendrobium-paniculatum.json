    "intro": "Dendrobium paniculatum, commonly known as the orchid of the forest, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients for the plant. Dendrobium paniculatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
