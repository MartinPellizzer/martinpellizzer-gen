    "intro": "Dendrobium johannis var. semifuscum, commonly known as the Johannis' Dendrobium variant, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features clustered pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical climates. Its flowers are typically white to pale yellow with green or brown markings, and it blooms during the summer months. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
