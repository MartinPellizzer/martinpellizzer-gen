    "intro": "Dicliptera haenkeana, commonly known as the broadleaf grass or wild millet, is a perennial grass species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Dicliptera haenkeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
