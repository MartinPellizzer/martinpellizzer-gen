    "intro": "Dendrobium pseudoconanthum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome that produces multiple pseudobulbs, each supporting a cluster of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking yellow and green flowers with prominent yellow sepals and petals, often resembling a spike. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
