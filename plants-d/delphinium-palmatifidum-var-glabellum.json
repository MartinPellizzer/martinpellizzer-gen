    "intro": "Delphinium palmatifidum var. glabellum, commonly known as the glabrous larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance, and are typically covered in fine hairs, though the 'glabellum' variety is noted for its reduced hairiness. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and children."
