    "intro": "Diasperus cuspidatus, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible fruits called tunas, which are widely consumed in various cuisines. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The plant also plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for desert wildlife."
