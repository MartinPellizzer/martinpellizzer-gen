    "intro": "Dichromena polystachys, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Dichromena polystachys is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
