    "intro": "Davallia rigidula, commonly known as the hard fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia. It is characterized by its stiff, leathery fronds that are typically gray-green in color and have a distinctive, rigid texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Davallia rigidula is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
