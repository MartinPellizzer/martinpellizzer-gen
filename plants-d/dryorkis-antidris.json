    "intro": "Dryorkis antidris, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a compact rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in a spike, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to semi-desert conditions. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscaped gardens."
