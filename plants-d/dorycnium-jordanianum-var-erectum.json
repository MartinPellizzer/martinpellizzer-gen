    "intro": "Dorycnium jordanianum var. erectum, commonly known as the Jordanian burclover, is a perennial herb native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by distinctive bur-like seed pods. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
