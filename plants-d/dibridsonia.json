It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant typically has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water in its native arid environments. Dibridsonia species are popular as houseplants due to their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. They thrive in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
