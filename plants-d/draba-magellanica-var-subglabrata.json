    "intro": "Draba magellanica var. subglabrata, commonly known as the Magellan's whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southern regions of South America. It features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to harsh, alpine environments, thriving in rocky soils and cold climates. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats. The variety subglabrata is distinguished by its reduced leaf pubescence compared to other varieties of Draba magellanica."
