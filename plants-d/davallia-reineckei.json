    "intro": "Davallia reineckei, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive silvery sheen on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense clumps. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of smaller leaflets, creating a lacy appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in tropical gardens and as a houseplant."
