    "intro": "Draba glacialis var. pectinata, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. This variety is distinguished by its pectinate (comb-like) leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. It typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in full sun and cool temperatures. Due to its specialized habitat, it is often found in mountainous areas of Europe and Asia."
