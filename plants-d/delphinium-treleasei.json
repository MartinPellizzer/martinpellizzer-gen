    "intro": "Delphinium treleasei, commonly known as the Tibetan larkspur, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are compound, with lance-shaped leaflets, and it produces elongated seed pods that release seeds by wind. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the wild."
