It is characterized by its slender, silver-haired inflorescence and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It has a fibrous root system and is often used for erosion control due to its dense growth habit. Digitaria albicoma is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
