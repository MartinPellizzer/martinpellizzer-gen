    "intro": "Diplostephium vermiculatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as wetlands and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions."
