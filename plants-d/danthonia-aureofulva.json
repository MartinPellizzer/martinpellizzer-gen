    "intro": "Danthonia aureofulva, commonly known as the golden hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-tipped foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland margins. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Danthonia aureofulva is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens and restoration projects."
