It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Drimys pachyphylla is valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
