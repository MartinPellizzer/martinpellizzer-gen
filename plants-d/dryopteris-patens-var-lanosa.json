    "intro": "Dryopteris patens var. lanosa, commonly known as the downy wood fern, is a perennial fern characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that remain throughout the year. It features a short, creeping rhizome with fibrous roots, and its fronds are typically divided into lance-shaped segments with a distinctive silvery-blue underside. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This variety is distinguished by its hairy (lanose) texture on the fronds, contributing to its unique appearance."
