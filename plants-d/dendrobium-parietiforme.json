    "intro": "Dendrobium parietiforme, commonly known as the wall orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that can grow along rock surfaces, adapting to its rocky habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often arranged in clusters. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Dendrobium parietiforme is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience."
