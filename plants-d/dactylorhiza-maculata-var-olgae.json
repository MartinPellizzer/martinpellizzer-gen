    "intro": "Dactylorhiza maculata var. olgae, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, linear leaves and its striking inflorescence of pink to purple flowers with a distinctive yellow spot on the lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands. It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is relatively rare and is considered a priority for conservation due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
