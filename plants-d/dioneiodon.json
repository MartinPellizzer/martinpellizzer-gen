    "intro": "Dioneiodon, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to South America. It features broad, waxy leaves that float on the surface of water, supported by long, spongy petioles. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as bats and moths. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Dioneiodon plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
