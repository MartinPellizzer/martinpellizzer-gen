    "intro": "Dipterocarpus subalpinus, commonly known as the Alpine dipterocarp, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and smooth, often reddish bark. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers and is notable for its hard, durable wood. It typically grows in lowland and hill forests, often reaching heights of up to 30 meters. Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
