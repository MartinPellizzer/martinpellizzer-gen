    "intro": "Duranta fischeri, commonly known as the silverleaf duranta, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a silvery-gray waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Duranta fischeri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant blooms and adaptability to various soil types. It thrives in full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
