    "intro": "Dolichos hosei, commonly known as the Indian bean or the horse gram, is a leguminous plant native to India and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing habit and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several kidney-shaped seeds. Dolichos hosei is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It is often cultivated for its edible seeds, which are used in various traditional cuisines."
