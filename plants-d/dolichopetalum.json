    "intro": "Dolichopetalum, commonly known as the long-petioled bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive bell-shaped flowers, which often display a range of colors from blue to purple. The leaves are typically opposite and have a hairy texture, contributing to their ornamental appeal. Dolichopetalum species are native to regions in the Mediterranean and the Middle East, where they thrive in rocky and arid environments. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
