    "intro": "Diplostephium floribundum subsp. farallonense, commonly known as Farallon Island cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Farallon Islands off the coast of California. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with dense, fleshy stems that store water, adapted to the arid and coastal conditions of its habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to maritime climates with strong winds and salt spray. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
