    "intro": "Dionysia revoluta subsp. canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf dionysia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Campanulaceae. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Native to the southeastern United States, this plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The subspecies canescens is distinguished by its more hairy leaves and stems compared to other subspecies of Dionysia revoluta. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various small organisms."
