    "intro": "Draba salsa, commonly known as the desert sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats or cushions near the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually succulent and adapted to conserve water, reflecting its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Draba salsa is often found in rocky soils and plays a role in stabilizing sandy or loose soil in its habitat."
