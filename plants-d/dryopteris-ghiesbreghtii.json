    "intro": "Dryopteris ghiesbreghtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile and sterile fronds that are often distinctly different in shape and structure. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
