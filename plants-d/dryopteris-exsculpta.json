It is characterized by its large, deeply divided fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive silver or white underside. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forested areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing year-round interest in the landscape."
