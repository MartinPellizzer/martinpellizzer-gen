It is an epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs covered in a dense, violet-colored sheath. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, with a distinctive, fragrant scent. It thrives in high light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
