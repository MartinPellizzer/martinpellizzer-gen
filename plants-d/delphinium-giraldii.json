    "intro": "Delphinium giraldii, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers, which are typically arranged in racemes along the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, typical of many delphinium species. Delphinium giraldii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations."
