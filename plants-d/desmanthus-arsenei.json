    "intro": "Desmanthus arsenei, commonly known as the Arizona burro's tail, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. It produces pods that contain several small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Desmanthus arsenei is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
