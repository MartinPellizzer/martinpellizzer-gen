    "intro": "Dryopteris deversa var. tarapotensis, commonly known as the Tarapotan water fern, is a rare and distinctive variant of the water fern genus Dryopteris. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
