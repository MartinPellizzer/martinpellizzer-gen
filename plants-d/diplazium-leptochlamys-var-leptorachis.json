    "intro": "Diplazium leptochlamys var. leptorachis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Diplazium. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant features delicate, pinnately divided fronds with a slender, wiry stem. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This variety is notable for its adaptability to aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
