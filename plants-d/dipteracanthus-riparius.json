    "intro": "Dipteracanthus riparius, commonly known as the river thistle, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, spiky inflorescence, which attracts pollinators such as bees and flies. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in riparian zones, making it ecologically significant. The species is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found along riverbanks and floodplains."
