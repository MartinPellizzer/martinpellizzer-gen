    "intro": "Drimia vermiformis, commonly known as the snake's head or snake's head lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a bulbous root system and produces striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant blooms with clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble a snake's head, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Drimia vermiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
