It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy underground stems that store nutrients. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in hot, dry climates. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. The tubers of Dioscorea dinteri are edible when properly prepared and have been used traditionally for food and medicinal purposes."
