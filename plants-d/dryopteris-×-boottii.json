    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 boottii, commonly known as the Boott's wood fern, is a hybrid fern that results from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octomeris. It is characterized by its large, intricately divided fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream sides, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients effectively. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
