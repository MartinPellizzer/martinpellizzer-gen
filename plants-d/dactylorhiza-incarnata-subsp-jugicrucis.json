    "intro": "Dactylorhiza incarnata subsp. jugicrucis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces tall, erect flowering stems that bear clusters of pale pink to white flowers. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption, typical of orchid species. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and smaller flowers compared to other Dactylorhiza species."
