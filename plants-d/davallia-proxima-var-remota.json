    "intro": "Davallia proxima var. remota, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family (Adiantaceae). It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically shorter and more slender than those of the typical Davallia proxima. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
