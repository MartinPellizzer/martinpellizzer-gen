    "intro": "Dissochaeta nemorosa, commonly known as the woodland panic grass, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flower clusters. Dissochaeta nemorosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
