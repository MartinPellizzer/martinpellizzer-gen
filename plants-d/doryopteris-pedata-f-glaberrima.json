    "intro": "Doryopteris pedata f. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous cliff fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and growth habits. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions with moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a compact, upright growth form that allows it to thrive in rocky or cliff habitats. This fern exhibits a glabrous (smooth) texture on its leaves, distinguishing it from other varieties of Doryopteris. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on fern morphology and adaptation to specific ecological niches."
