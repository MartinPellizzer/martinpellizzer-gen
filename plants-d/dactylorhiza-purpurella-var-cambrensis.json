    "intro": "Dactylorhiza purpurella var. cambrensis, commonly known as the Welsh pink orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to western Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream sides. It has a complex root system with mycorrhizal associations that aid in nutrient uptake. The species is considered rare and is protected in several countries due to habitat loss and over-collection."
