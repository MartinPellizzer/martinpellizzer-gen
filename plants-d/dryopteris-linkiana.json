    "intro": "Dryopteris linkiana, commonly known as the Link's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features a robust, upright rhizome and produces fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, glossy appearance. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Dryopteris linkiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
