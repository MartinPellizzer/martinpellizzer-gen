    "intro": "Dendrobium tortile var. hildebrandii, commonly known as the Hildebrand's Wandering Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender stems that coil and twist, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive, intricate pattern. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
