    "intro": "Dendrochilum cinnabarinum, commonly known as the red-orange orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features pendulous, hairy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, red-orange flowers with yellow and brown markings, which bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Dendrochilum cinnabarinum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
