    "intro": "Desmodium styracifolium, commonly known as the sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive sweet scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its root system has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility. Desmodium styracifolium is often used in forage and as a cover crop due to its hardy nature and ecological benefits."
