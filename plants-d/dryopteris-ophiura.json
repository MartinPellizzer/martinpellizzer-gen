    "intro": "Dryopteris ophiura, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies."
