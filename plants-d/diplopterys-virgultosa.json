    "intro": "Diplopterys virgultosa, commonly known as the Amazonian starfruit, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, star-shaped fruits. Its botanical significance lies in its role within the ecosystem and its potential medicinal uses. However, it is not widely cultivated and remains relatively understudied compared to other tropical plants."
