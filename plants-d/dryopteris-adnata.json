    "intro": "Dryopteris adnata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pale brown, cinnamon-colored fertile fronds that contrast with its dark green sterile fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a rhizomatous growth habit and can form dense colonies over time. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a unique, upright growth pattern that makes it easily recognizable."
