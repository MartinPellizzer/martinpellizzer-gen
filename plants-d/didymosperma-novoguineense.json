    "intro": "Didymosperma novoguineense, commonly known as the Guinean starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to New Guinea. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that resemble starfruits, though they are not closely related to the common starfruit (Carambola). It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant has potential economic value due to its fruit and may be used in traditional medicine."
