    "intro": "Dischidia crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved air plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy, and often waxy leaves that are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding ornamental value. Dischidia crassifolia is often grown as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor conditions."
