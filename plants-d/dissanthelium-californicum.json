    "intro": "Dissanthelium californicum, commonly known as California basketgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical structure supports its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
