    "intro": "Dryopteris erythrovaria, commonly known as the red-stemmed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown stems that remain visible throughout the winter. The fronds are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they unfurl in a spiral pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
