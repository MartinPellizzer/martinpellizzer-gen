    "intro": "Dehaasia pugerensis, commonly known as the Puger's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and delicate, translucent leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often blooming during the late afternoon. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered endangered. Botanists study it to better understand its unique adaptations and conservation needs."
