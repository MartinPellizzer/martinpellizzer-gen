    "intro": "Dipteracanthus schauerianus var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf dipteracanthus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers range in color from white to pale pink. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservatories."
