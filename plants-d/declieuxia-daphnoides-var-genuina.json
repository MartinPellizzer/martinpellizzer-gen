    "intro": "Declieuxia daphnoides var. genuina, commonly known as the silver fern, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features delicate, feathery fronds that resemble the shape of a fern, with a silvery-blue hue due to the dense covering of fine, hair-like trichomes on its leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its foliage is highly ornamental, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and shady landscapes. The species is notable for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
