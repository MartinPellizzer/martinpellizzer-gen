    "intro": "Dracaena indivisa, commonly known as the paddle plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, narrow, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically green with a yellow or white margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Dracaena indivisa is relatively low maintenance and can tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
