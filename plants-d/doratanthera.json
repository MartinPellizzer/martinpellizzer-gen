    "intro": "Doratanthera, commonly known as the blue-eyed orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their striking blue or violet flowers. Doratanthera species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in humid tropical environments. The flowers are often clustered in loose inflorescences and feature showy petals and sepals. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated for horticultural purposes."
