    "intro": "Dorstenia caatingae, commonly known as the caatinga dwarf banana, is a unique plant native to the semi-arid regions of northeastern Brazil. It belongs to the family Musaceae, which includes bananas and plantains, though it is a small, shrub-like species rather than a true banana. The plant features a short, thick stem with broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in the axils of the leaves, and it produces berries that are edible when ripe. Dorstenia caatingae is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it an important component of the caatinga biome."
