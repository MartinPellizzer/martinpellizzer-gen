    "intro": "Dryopteris producta, commonly known as the barren sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a distinctive, narrow, and leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its elegant appearance."
