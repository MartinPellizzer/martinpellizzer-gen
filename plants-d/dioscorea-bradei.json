    "intro": "Dioscorea bradei, commonly known as Brade's yam, is a species of flowering plant in the family Dioscoreaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria and Ghana. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. Its tuberous roots are the primary part used, though the plant itself is less commonly cultivated compared to other yam species. Dioscorea bradei plays a minor role in local traditional medicine and subsistence agriculture."
