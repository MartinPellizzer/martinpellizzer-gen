It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Dinebra panicoides is primarily valued for its use in erosion control and as a forage crop for livestock."
