    "intro": "Deschampsia littoralis var. rhenana, commonly known as the coastal feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and tufted inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. It is adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a resilient plant in harsh maritime environments. Its ornamental value has also led to its cultivation in gardens with similar conditions."
