    "intro": "Dialium kunstleri var. trifoliolatum, commonly known as the three-leaf tamarind, is a tropical tree native to western Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. The bark and leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks."
