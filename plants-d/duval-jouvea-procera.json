It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, arranged spirally along the stem. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
