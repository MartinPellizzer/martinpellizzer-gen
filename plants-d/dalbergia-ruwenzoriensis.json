    "intro": "Dalbergia ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Rwenzori ebony, is a rare and valuable hardwood tree native to the mountainous regions of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly sought after for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated pods. Due to its limited distribution and susceptibility to habitat loss, Dalbergia ruwenzoriensis is considered an endangered species."
