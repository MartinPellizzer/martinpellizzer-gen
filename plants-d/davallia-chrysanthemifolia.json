    "intro": "Davallia chrysanthemifolia, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive golden hue on the underside, which becomes more pronounced in sunlight. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense, compact clumps. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation and shaded garden settings."
