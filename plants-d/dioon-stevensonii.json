    "intro": "Dioon stevensonii, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to the Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to three meters in length. The plant produces distinctive, spiny cones that contain both male and female reproductive structures. It is a slow-growing, long-lived plant that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
