    "intro": "Derwentia blakelyi, commonly known as the Blakely's derwentia, is a rare and endemic fern species found exclusively in the southeastern region of South Australia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Derwentia blakelyi is considered a species of conservation concern."
