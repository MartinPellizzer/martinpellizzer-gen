    "intro": "Danthonia lanata, commonly known as the silky hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, slender leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, woodlands, and coastal areas. Danthonia lanata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
