    "intro": "Dracaena hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy dracaena, is a tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Dracaena hirsuta thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
