    "intro": "Doryopteris concolor, commonly known as the green fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, spiraled pattern. Doryopteris concolor thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of its native habitat."
