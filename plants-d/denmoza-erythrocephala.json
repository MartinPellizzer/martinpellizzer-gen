    "intro": "Denmoza erythrocephala, commonly known as the red-headed daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features striking, showy yellow flowers with red centers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Denmoza erythrocephala is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
