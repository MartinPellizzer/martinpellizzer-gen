    "intro": "Dendrobium piestobulbon, commonly known as the Peat Bulb Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. The leaves are strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its unique appearance."
