    "intro": "Dryopteris dispar, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. The slender wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
