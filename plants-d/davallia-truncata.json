    "intro": "Davallia truncata, commonly known as the serrate holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features fronds that are pinnately compound, with a distinctive serrated margin that gives it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. Davallia truncata thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage."
