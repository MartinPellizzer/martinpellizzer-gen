    "intro": "Dalea pectinata, commonly known as the pectinate Dalea, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring, and its leaves are pinnately compound with a distinctive, feathery appearance. Dalea pectinata is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to nutrient cycling in arid ecosystems. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in xerophytic communities."
