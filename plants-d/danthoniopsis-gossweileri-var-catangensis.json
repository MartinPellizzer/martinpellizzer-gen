    "intro": "Danthoniopsis gossweileri var. catangensis, commonly known as the Catangensis grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dune environments. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its dense, compact growth and ability to stabilize soil in arid conditions."
