It is characterized by its distinctive two-toned leaves, which often display contrasting colors on their upper and lower surfaces. The plants typically have small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pink in color. Dichromus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and Asia. They are often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodland areas."
