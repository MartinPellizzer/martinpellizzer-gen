    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 dinglensis subsp. braunii, commonly known as the Braun's marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and North Africa. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has a slender, often branched stem with oval, dark green leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. This orchid is noted for its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in semi-natural habitats."
