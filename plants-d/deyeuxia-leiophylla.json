    "intro": "Deyeuxia leiophylla, commonly known as the smooth-leaf sedgeland grass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded areas. Deyeuxia leiophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
