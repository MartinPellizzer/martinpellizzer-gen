    "intro": "Dendrobium suberectum, commonly known as the stiff upright dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that are often covered in a thick, leathery sheath. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in two rows along the stem. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
