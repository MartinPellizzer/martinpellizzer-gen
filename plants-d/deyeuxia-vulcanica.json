    "intro": "Deyeuxia vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic grass, is a perennial grass species native to volcanic regions. It thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils found in areas with recent volcanic activity. The plant features slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of ash or mineral deposits. Its flowering spikes are usually small and inconspicuous, producing tiny grains of seeds. Deyeuxia vulcanica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in harsh volcanic environments."
