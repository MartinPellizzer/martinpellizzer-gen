    "intro": "Didymocarpus pallidus, commonly known as the pale mangosteen, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its palm-like appearance with a smooth, pale-colored trunk. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to wet tropical soils. Didymocarpus pallidus is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its potential medicinal properties."
