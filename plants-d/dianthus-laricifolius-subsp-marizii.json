    "intro": "Dianthus laricifolius subsp. marizii, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The subspecies marizii is distinguished by its slightly larger flowers and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Dianthus laricifolius."
