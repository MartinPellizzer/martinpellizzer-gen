    "intro": "Diplazium expansum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, graceful appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant. Diplazium expansum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
