    "intro": "Drymaria excisa, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Drymaria excisa is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
