It features fleshy, upright stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
