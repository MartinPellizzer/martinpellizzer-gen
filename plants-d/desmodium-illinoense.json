    "intro": "Desmodium illinoense, commonly known as Illinois ticktrefoil, is a perennial legume native to the central United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like structures that split open when mature. Desmodium illinoense is often found in prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria."
