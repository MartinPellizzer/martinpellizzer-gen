It features long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
