    "intro": "Doronicum nendtvichii, commonly known as the Nendt's leopard's bane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in a single terminal head. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
