    "intro": "Dryopteris subcuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a slightly curled margin. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive line along the undersides of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture for its elegant appearance."
