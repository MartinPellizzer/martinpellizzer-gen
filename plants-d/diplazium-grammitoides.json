    "intro": "Diplazium grammitoides, commonly known as the slender chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This species is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
