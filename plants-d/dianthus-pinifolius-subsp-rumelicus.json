    "intro": "Dianthus pinifolius subsp. rumelicus, commonly known as the Alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its clusters of pink or red, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, needle-like leaves, which are adapted to thrive in harsh alpine environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This plant is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
