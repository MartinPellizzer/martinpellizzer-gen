    "intro": "Diplusodon amoenus, commonly known as the beautiful sand dollar, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the family Elasmobranchii. It is characterized by its distinctive, sand-covered, globular shape and a unique radial symmetry. The plant, more accurately a marine animal, has a calcareous skeleton that forms a pattern of radial plates. It typically inhabits shallow coastal waters and is often found buried in sandy substrates. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and serves as an indicator of marine ecosystem health."
