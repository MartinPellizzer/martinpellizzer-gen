    "intro": "Dendrobium \u00d7 fleischeri, commonly known as the Fleischer's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical environments. Its flowers are typically showy, with a range of colors including white, yellow, and pink, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
