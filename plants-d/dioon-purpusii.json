    "intro": "Dioon purpusii, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a slow-growing, evergreen plant native to southeastern Mexico. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody, spiny fruits that contain seeds. Dioon purpusii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
