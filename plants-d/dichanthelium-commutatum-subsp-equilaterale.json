    "intro": "Dichanthelium commutatum subsp. equilaterale, commonly known as the narrowleaf panicum, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically 3\u20136 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early summer, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands and along streambanks. This subspecies is often found in disturbed sites and is adapted to both full sun and partial shade."
