It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, spiny pods that contain small, bean-like seeds. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is known for its nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or spreading, making it suitable for ground cover in certain ecosystems. Desmodium biarticulatum is also noted for its potential in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
