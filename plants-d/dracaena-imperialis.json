    "intro": "Dracaena imperialis, commonly known as the imperial dracaena, is a striking ornamental plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its distinctive, sword-shaped leaves that are dark green with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
