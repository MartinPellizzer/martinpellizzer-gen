    "intro": "Davallia cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver or pale green. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots and roots. Its fronds are usually shorter than its rhizomes, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Davallia cuneifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
