    "intro": "Dichanthelium dichotomum, commonly known as the two-branched grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and disturbed areas. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, which is common among grasses. Dichanthelium dichotomum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
