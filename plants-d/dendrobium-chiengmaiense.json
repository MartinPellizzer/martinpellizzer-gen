    "intro": "Dendrobium chiengmaiense, commonly known as the Chieng Mai orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, fragrant scent. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
