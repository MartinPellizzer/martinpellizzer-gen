    "intro": "Dissanthelium, commonly known as the grass genus within the family Poaceae, consists of several species native to North America. These plants are typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and woodland edges. They are characterized by their slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Dissanthelium species are often used in ecological studies due to their adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
