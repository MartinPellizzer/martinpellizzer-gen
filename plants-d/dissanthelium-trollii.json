    "intro": "Dissanthelium trollii, commonly known as the troll's grass, is a rare and endemic grass species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and tough, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dissanthelium trollii is considered a vulnerable species."
