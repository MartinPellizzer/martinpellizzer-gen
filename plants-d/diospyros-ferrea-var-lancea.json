    "intro": "Diospyros ferrea var. lancea, commonly known as the ironwood or Brazilian ebony, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ebenaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dense, dark wood and hardy growth habits. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters, with lanceolate leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers are small and clustered, often greenish-yellow in color, and it produces small, round fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. The plant is valued for its strong, durable wood, which has been used historically in furniture and tool-making."
