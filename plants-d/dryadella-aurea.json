    "intro": "Dryadella aurea, commonly known as the golden dryad, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are arranged in a dense, compact cluster. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical gardens."
