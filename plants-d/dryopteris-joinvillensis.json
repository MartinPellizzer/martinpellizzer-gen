    "intro": "Dryopteris joinvillensis, commonly known as the Joinville fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
