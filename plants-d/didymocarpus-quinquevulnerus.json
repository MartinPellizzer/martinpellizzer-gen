It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
