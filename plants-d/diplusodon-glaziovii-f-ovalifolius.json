It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typical leaf structures. The f. ovalifolius form is distinguished by its elongated, oval-shaped leaves, which are broader and more pronounced than those of the typical variety. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense tropical forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
