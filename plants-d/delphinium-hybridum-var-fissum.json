It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with large, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The flowers are typically arranged in racemes and have five petals, with the lower petal being spurred, a characteristic feature of the Delphinium genus. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinctive white or pale green stripe down the midrib. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes and rock gardens."
