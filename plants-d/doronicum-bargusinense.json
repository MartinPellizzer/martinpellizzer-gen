It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
