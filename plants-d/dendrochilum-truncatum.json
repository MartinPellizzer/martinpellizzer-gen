    "intro": "Dendrochilum truncatum, commonly known as the truncated tree orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, tree-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often blooming during the dry season. Its leaves are typically thick and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss. Dendrochilum truncatum is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to grow in challenging conditions."
