    "intro": "Demorchis okinawensis, commonly known as the Okinawa orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a pseudobulb and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces a single flower with a distinctive, fragrant, white to pale pink spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
