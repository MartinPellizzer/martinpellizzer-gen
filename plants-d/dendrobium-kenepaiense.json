    "intro": "Dendrobium kenepaiense, commonly known as the Kenepai orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually fragrant and come in shades of white, pink, and purple, often blooming during the rainy season. Dendrobium kenepaiense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
