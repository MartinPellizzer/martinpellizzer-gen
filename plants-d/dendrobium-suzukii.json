    "intro": "Dendrobium suzukii, commonly known as the Japanese orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, which is an adaptation to its often arid or semi-arid habitat. Its flowers are typically small, fragrant, and come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. Dendrobium suzukii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
