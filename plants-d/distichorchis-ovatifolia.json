    "intro": "Distichorchis ovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its linear, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Distichorchis ovatifolia is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific environmental conditions for successful growth."
