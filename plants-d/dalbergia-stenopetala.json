    "intro": "Dalbergia stenopetala, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces hard, dark wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
