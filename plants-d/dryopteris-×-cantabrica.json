    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian wood fern, is a hybrid fern native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, which are typically found in the late spring and summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
