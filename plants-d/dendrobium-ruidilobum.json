    "intro": "Dendrobium ruidilobum, commonly known as the Ruidilobum orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are usually clustered in inflorescences, displaying a range of colors from white to pink and yellow. The plant's botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for both horticultural cultivation and botanical study."
