It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by cylindrical, hairy fruits containing numerous seeds. Its tuberous roots are the primary part used, valued for their starchy content and traditional medicinal uses. However, it is important to note that the plant contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
