    "intro": "Drymonia chiribogana, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of western Ecuador and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,200 and 2,500 meters, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
