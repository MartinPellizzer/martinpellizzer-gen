    "intro": "Dryopteris danesiana, commonly known as the Danish wood fern, is a species of polypod fern native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. The spores are produced in compact, stalked sori located on the underside of the fronds."
