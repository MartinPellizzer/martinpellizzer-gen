    "intro": "Dactylus trapezuntinus, commonly known as the Trapezuntine dactyl, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces distinctive, elongated fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
