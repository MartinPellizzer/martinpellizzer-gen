    "intro": "Digitalis dubia var. longipedunculata, commonly known as the long pedunculate foxglove, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces striking, hooded flowers in shades of pink to purple, arranged in racemes along the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This variety is notable for its elongated peduncles, which support its showy flowers and contribute to its ornamental value in gardens."
