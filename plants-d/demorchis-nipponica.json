    "intro": "Demorchis nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese orchid, is a species of orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often clustered in racemes. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture, though it remains relatively uncommon in the wild."
