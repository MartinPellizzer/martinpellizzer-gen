    "intro": "Dendrobium hosei, commonly known as the Hosen's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Dendrobium hosei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
