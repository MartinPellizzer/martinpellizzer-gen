    "intro": "Delphinium hamatum, commonly known as the Colorado larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It features tall, spindly stems that can reach up to six feet in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often avoided in gardens for safety reasons."
