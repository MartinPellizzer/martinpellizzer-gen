    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis f. chwaszczyniensis, commonly known as the chwaszczyniensi orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the British Isles. It is a terrestrial orchid with a sympodial growth habit, characterized by its short, creeping rhizomes. The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing several lance-shaped leaves and a spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and is often found in areas with rich, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in the UK."
