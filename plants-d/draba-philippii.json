    "intro": "Draba philippii, commonly known as the Philippi's whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Draba philippii is adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a food source for various pollinators and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky habitats."
