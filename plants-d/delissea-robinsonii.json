    "intro": "Delissea robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's delissea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in shaded forest understories, preferring humid and cool climates. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected botanical gardens or conservation sites."
