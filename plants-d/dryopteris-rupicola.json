    "intro": "Dryopteris rupicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in shaded, humid environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris rupicola is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
