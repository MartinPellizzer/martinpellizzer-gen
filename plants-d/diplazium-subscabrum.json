    "intro": "Diplazium subscabrum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its robust, upright fronds with a rough, scaly texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous cover. Diplazium subscabrum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, evergreen foliage."
