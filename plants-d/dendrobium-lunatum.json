    "intro": "Dendrobium lunatum, commonly known as the moon orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, drooping inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that resemble a crescent moon, hence its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates with high light exposure and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium lunatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
