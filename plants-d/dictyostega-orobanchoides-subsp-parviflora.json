    "intro": "Dictyostega orobanchoides subsp. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered broomrape, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are often overlooked due to its parasitic nature. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in disturbed soils. Due to its lack of visible leaves and reliance on hosts, it plays a unique role in ecosystem dynamics as a secondary producer."
