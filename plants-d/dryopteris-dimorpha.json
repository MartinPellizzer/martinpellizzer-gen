    "intro": "Dryopteris dimorpha, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are often divided into two distinct types of pinnae, one more upright and the other more drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
