    "intro": "Dryopteris lepidopoda, commonly known as the Lepidopod Shield Fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, robust fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, small pinnae that give the plant a dense, shield-like appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies."
