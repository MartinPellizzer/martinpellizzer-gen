    "intro": "Diuris lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spider-orchid, is an Australian native orchid characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive spider-like flowers. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils and sunny to semi-shaded conditions. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow or pale brown flowers with a prominent, elongated spur. It is part of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms involving insects. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
