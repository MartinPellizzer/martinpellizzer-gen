It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like structures that produce wind-pollinated flowers. Digitaria fauriei plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
