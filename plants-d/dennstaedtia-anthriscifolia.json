    "intro": "Dennstaedtia anthriscifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, triangular, and often lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive row. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction."
