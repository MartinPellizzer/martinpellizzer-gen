    "intro": "Decumaria barbara var. sarmentosa, commonly known as creeping coralroot, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring. The plant is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. Its stems are often prostrate or trailing, forming dense mats on the forest floor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
