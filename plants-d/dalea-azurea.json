    "intro": "Dalea azurea, commonly known as blue milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as desert plains and grasslands. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, bean-like pods that contain the seeds. Dalea azurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens for its vibrant color and drought tolerance."
