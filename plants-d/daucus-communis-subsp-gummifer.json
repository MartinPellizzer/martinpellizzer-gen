    "intro": "Daucus communis subsp. gummifer, commonly known as the gummed cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a mild, parsley-like scent. This subspecies is distinguished by the presence of a sticky, resinous substance on its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name."
