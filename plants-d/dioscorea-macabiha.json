    "intro": "Dioscorea macabiha, commonly known as the Macabiha yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are covered in tendrils that aid in climbing. The tubers of Dioscorea macabiha are valued for their starchy content and have been traditionally used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
