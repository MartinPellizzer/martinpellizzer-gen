    "intro": "Draba helleriana f. pallida, commonly known as the pale draba, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically features basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces yellow or white flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
