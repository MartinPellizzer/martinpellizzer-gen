    "intro": "Dendrobium minax, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or golden in color, which bloom in clusters. Dendrobium minax has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, helping it survive in its natural habitat. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and floral arrangements."
