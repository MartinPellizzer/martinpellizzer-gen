    "intro": "Darea cuneata, commonly known as the narrowleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces bright yellow flowers that develop into fluffy seed heads. Darea cuneata is often found in disturbed soils and open areas, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its ecological niche and environmental conditions."
