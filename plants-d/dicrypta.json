    "intro": "Dicrypta, commonly known as the false holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often with opposite, simple leaves that are usually elliptic or ovate in shape. They produce small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Dicrypta species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in horticulture for their attractive foliage and floral displays."
