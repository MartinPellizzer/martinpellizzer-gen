    "intro": "Dallwatsonia aurita, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear bright yellow flowers resembling small bells. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its pseudobulbs and producing aerial roots for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dallwatsonia aurita is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in warm, humid environments."
