    "intro": "Drakonorchis mesocera, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 20 centimeters in diameter, featuring vibrant colors such as purple, pink, and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, while its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients. Drakonorchis mesocera is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting diverse rainforest biodiversity."
