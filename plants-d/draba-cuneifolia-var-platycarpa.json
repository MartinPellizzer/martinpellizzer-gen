    "intro": "Draba cuneifolia var. platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are narrow and grass-like. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its fruits are distinctive, being broad and somewhat flattened, which is a key feature of the varietal name *platycarpa*. This species is adapted to rocky and arid environments, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats."
