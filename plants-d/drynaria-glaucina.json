    "intro": "Drynaria glaucina, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
