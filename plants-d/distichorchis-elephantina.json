    "intro": "Distichorchis elephantina, commonly known as the elephant's tusk orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring two prominent, tusk-like petals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture and indirect light. Its flowers are usually a mix of white and green hues, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
