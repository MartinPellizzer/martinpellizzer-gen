    "intro": "Dorstenia crispata, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, zigzagging stems that help it climb or trail along the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by distinctive, spiral-shaped fruits. Its leaves are typically alternate, heart-shaped, and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Dorstenia crispata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
