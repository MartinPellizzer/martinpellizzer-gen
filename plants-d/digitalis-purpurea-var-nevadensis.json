    "intro": "Digitalis purpurea var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada foxglove, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of purple and pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh alpine conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are pollinated primarily by bumblebees. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in its native ecosystem."
