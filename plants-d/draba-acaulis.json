    "intro": "Draba acaulis, commonly known as the cushion sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, with small, tightly packed leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically borne on short, hairy stems. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in survival in cold, dry conditions. Draba acaulis is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures."
