    "intro": "Drosera loureiroi, commonly known as the Brazilian sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It features sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Drosera loureiroi is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
