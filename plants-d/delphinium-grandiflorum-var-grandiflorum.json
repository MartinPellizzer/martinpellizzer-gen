    "intro": "Delphinium grandiflorum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the tall larkspur, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that range in color from blue to purple and occasionally white. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and produces numerous spikes of flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. However, it is toxic to livestock and humans due to the presence of alkaloids."
