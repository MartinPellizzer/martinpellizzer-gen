    "intro": "Deinosmos, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and its unique, delicate white or greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a complex root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
