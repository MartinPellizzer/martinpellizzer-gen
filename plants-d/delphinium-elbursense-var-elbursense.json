    "intro": "Delphinium elbursense var. elbursense, commonly known as the Elburz delphinium, is a perennial herb native to the Elburz Mountains in Iran. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
