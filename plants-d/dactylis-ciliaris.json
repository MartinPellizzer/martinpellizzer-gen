    "intro": "Dactylis ciliaris, commonly known as silky brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color. It is well adapted to temperate climates and is often used in forage and erosion control. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to form dense mats, making it a hardy and resilient species."
