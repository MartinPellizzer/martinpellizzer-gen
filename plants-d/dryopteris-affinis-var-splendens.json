    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis var. splendens, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is characterized by its striking golden to bronze-colored fronds that contrast with its dark green base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with fertile pinnae that produce spores on the underside. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its vibrant color and hardy nature."
