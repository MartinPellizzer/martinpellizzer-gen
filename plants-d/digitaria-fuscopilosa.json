    "intro": "Digitaria fuscopilosa, commonly known as black-stemmed browntop, is a grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, flat leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Digitaria fuscopilosa is a perennial species that can form extensive colonies, making it both a weed and a potential forage plant."
