It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its slender, thread-like leaves give it its scientific name, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring.
