    "intro": "Dalbergaria robusta, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a hard, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, round pods containing several seeds. Dalbergaria robusta is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance."
