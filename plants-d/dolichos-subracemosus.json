    "intro": "Dolichos subracemosus, commonly known as the hairy cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect or climbing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that give way to elongated, cylindrical pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used as a forage crop or for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various agricultural and ecological settings."
