    "intro": "Daphne kiusiana var. fasciata, commonly known as the variegated daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with white and green patterns on its leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring careful handling and placement."
