    "intro": "Dryopteris multiauriculata, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed fronds. It features a rugged, leathery texture with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes golden underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, typical of the fern life cycle. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections."
