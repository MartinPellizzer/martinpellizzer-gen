    "intro": "Dendrobium rigidifolium, commonly known as the rigid-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, wiry stems and narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium rigidifolium is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
