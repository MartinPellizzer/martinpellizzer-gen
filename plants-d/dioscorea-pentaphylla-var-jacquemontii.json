    "intro": "Dioscorea pentaphylla var. jacquemontii, commonly known as the purple yam, is a climbing perennial vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It produces tubers that are characterized by their striking violet to purple coloration, which is due to the presence of anthocyanins. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and bears small, greenish-white flowers that develop into berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible tubers. The species is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
