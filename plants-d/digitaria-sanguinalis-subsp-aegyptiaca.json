    "intro": "Digitaria sanguinalis subsp. aegyptiaca, commonly known as Egyptian digitaria, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that aids in reducing water loss. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments."
