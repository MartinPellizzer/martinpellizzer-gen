It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and distinctive inflorescences that resemble small umbrellas. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white trichomes, which contribute to its textured appearance. The flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a pale green to yellowish hue."
