    "intro": "Dichapetalum leucosia, commonly known as the white-flowered dichapetalum, is a shrub native to the eastern and southern regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its flowers are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Dichapetalum leucosia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks."
