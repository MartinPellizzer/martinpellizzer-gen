    "intro": "Dampiera altissima, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or greyish hue, which helps reduce water loss. Dampiera altissima is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
