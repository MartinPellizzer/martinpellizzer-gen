It is characterized by its dark purple or black rhizomes, which are thick and fleshy, storing moisture and nutrients. The plant produces tall, slender stems with clusters of small, pale green to white flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
