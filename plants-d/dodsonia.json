    "intro": "Dodsonia, commonly known as the alpine clubmoss, is a genus of small, evergreen plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. These plants are typically found in cool, moist environments such as mountainous regions and forest understories. Dodsonia species are characterized by their slender, branching stems and tiny, scale-like leaves. They reproduce via spores rather than seeds, a feature common to many primitive vascular plants. Due to their delicate nature, they are often used in horticulture as ornamental plants in shaded gardens."
