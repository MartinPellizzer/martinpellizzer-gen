    "intro": "Dryopteris submollis, commonly known as the soft shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bright green and often have a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Dryopteris submollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful foliage."
