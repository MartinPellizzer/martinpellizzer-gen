    "intro": "Doemia extensa, commonly known as the broadleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and a single, hollow stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. Doemia extensa is a hardy perennial that plays a role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
