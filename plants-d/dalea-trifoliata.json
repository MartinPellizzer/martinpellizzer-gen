    "intro": "Dalea trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf false indigo, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. The plant produces spikes of small, violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Dalea trifoliata is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
