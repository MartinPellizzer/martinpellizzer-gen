    "intro": "Draba alpina var. nana, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to harsh, cold environments and thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. It is often found in mountainous areas where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates. Its compact growth habit and resilience make it a characteristic component of alpine flora."
