    "intro": "Dracontomelon sinense, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by yellowish-orange fruits containing three to four seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions for its rapid growth and adaptability. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas due to its ability to outcompete native flora."
