    "intro": "Diplazium shepherdii var. stuebeliana, commonly known as Stuebel's cliff brake, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which are further subdivided into pinnules, giving the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or cliff habitats. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
