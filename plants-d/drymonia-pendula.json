    "intro": "Drymonia pendula, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous fronds that droop from the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which attracts nocturnal pollinators. This unique botanical feature makes it a fascinating subject for both ecological study and botanical appreciation."
