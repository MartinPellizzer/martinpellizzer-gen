    "intro": "Dendrobium yongii, commonly known as the Yong's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in humid, well-lit environments with good air circulation. Dendrobium yongii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for both horticultural and conservation purposes."
