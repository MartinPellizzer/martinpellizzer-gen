It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in dense, white woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species."
