    "intro": "Dendranthema lavandulifolium var. tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly lavenderleaf chrysanthemum, is a variant of the chrysanthemum family with distinctive foliage. Its leaves are covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow, typical of many chrysanthemum species. It is native to regions of China and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact growth habit."
