It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. Dicranopygium coma-pyrrhae is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
