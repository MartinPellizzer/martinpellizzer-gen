    "intro": "Dolichlasium, commonly known as the long-stalked bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Campanulaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to purple. The plants are native to regions in Europe and Asia, often growing in moist, woodland habitats. Dolichlasium species usually have elongated stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help distinguish them from other members of the family. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens."
