    "intro": "Desmoncus mitis subsp. rurrenabaquensis, commonly known as the Rurrenabaque ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the Amazon rainforest of Bolivia. It is characterized by its striking, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, growing on trees without deriving nutrients from them, and thrives in the humid, shaded understory of the forest. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its tropical environment. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
