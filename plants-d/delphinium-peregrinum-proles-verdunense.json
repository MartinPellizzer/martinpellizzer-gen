    "intro": "Delphinium peregrinum proles verdunense, commonly known as the Verdun dwarf larkspur, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the region around Verdun in France. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, spurred flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It produces blue to purple flowers with long, slender sepals that resemble a spur, aiding in pollination by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
