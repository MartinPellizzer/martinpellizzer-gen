    "intro": "Dendrobium bigibbum f. compactum, commonly known as the compact form of the iron orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in warm, humid environments. The plant features compact, dense growth with short, thick stems and numerous small, clustered flowers. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a prominent red lip, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. This variety is valued for its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
