    "intro": "Diplachne fleckii, commonly known as Fleck's grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its adaptability, Diplachne fleckii is sometimes considered an invasive species in areas outside its native range."
