    "intro": "Draba daurica f. brachycarpa, commonly known as the Daurian rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of East Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its compact growth habit and short, thick stems are adaptations to its harsh, high-altitude habitat. The f. brachycarpa form is distinguished by its shorter, more robust fruits compared to the typical form."
