    "intro": "Dyschoriste celebica, commonly known as the Celebes dyschoris, is a flowering plant native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, such as forest understories, and has opposite, elliptical leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow and are clustered in dense inflorescences, making it visually striking in its natural environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dyschoriste celebica is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
