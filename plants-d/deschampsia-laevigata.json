    "intro": "Deschampsia laevigata, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to western North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and delicate, silver-tipped inflorescences. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and streambanks. It has a clump-forming growth habit and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. The leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hair, giving it a silky appearance."
