    "intro": "Dianthus lusitanus var. minoripetalus, commonly known as the lesser Portuguese carnation, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features showy, double flowers that are typically pink or red, with a distinctive, frilled petal structure. The plant has succulent, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native region."
