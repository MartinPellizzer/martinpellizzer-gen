    "intro": "Diplachne tarapacana, commonly known as the Atacama grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is adapted to extreme desert conditions, exhibiting drought tolerance and a low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy substrates. Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
