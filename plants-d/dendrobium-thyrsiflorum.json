It features a tall, branched stem with numerous small, clustered flowers that bloom in a striking display of white and yellow. The plant has leathery, strap-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. Dendrobium thyrsiflorum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beautiful, long-lasting blooms."
