It features slender, erect stems that bear a single, showy flower with a white lip and greenish-yellow petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, due to their attractive coloration and nectar production. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
