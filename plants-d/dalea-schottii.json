    "intro": "Dalea schottii, commonly known as Schott's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features slender, branching stems and produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Dalea schottii is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ability to thrive in challenging environments."
