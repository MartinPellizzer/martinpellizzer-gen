    "intro": "Drosera stylosa, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a dense spike, and it produces a single seed capsule. Drosera stylosa is a low-growing plant that thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in swampy or marshy areas."
