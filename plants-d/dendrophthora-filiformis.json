    "intro": "Dendrophthora filiformis, commonly known as the slender coralwood, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical rainforests. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on tree bark for support rather than soil. Due to its specialized growth habits, it is often found in the canopy layers of dense forests."
