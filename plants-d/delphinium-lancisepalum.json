    "intro": "Delphinium lancisepalum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lanceolate, with serrated edges, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Delphinium lancisepalum is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers but is toxic to both humans and animals due to the presence of alkaloids."
