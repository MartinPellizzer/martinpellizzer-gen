    "intro": "Digitaria stricta var. denudata, commonly known as slender fingergrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in pastures. This variety is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
