    "intro": "Diaphananthe obanensis, commonly known as the Oban Island heath, is a rare flowering plant native to the Scottish island of Oban. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland or moorland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
