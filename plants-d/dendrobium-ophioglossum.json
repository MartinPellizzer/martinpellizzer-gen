    "intro": "Dendrobium ophioglossum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and its ability to grow without soil, attaching itself to tree bark. The plant produces striking, orchid-like flowers with a distinctive ghostly appearance, often with a greenish or white hue. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
