    "intro": "Dryopteris parachrysocoma, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow fronds, which are particularly striking in the early spring when they emerge. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving them a delicate, feathery appearance. The golden fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
