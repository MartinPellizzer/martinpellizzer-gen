    "intro": "Daemonorops manillensis, commonly known as the Manila rattan, is a climbing palm native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its long, flexible stems used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by clustered, dark blue-black fruits. Its leaves are pinnate, with long, narrow segments that give it a feathery appearance. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
