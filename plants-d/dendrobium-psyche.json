    "intro": "Dendrobium psyche, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, airy substrates to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and elusive nature make it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, it is listed as endangered in several regions."
