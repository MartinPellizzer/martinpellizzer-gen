    "intro": "Delosperma longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant pink to purple flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a drought-tolerant choice for rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular plant among succulent enthusiasts."
