    "intro": "Drymoglossum schlechteri, commonly known as the slender fern moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leafy structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant forms dense mats and has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in two rows. It is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Due to its low growth habit and preference for humid conditions, it is a popular choice for moisture-retentive garden settings."
