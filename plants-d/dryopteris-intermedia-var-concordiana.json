    "intro": "Dryopteris intermedia var. concordiana, commonly known as the Concord fern, is a variant of the intermediate wood fern. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 1 to 2 meters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give the plant a lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Botanically, it has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds."
