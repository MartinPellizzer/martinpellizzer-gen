    "intro": "[WRONG START] Dactylis glomerata var. filiforia, commonly known as silky grass or filiforous bents, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silky foliage that gives it a soft, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically brown or purplish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. This variety is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
