    "intro": "Davallia micans, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that appear almost translucent, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing structures called sorus. Davallia micans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in indoor settings."
