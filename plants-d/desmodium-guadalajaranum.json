    "intro": "Desmodium guadalajaranum, commonly known as Mexican velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods containing small, dark seeds that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural systems to improve soil fertility."
