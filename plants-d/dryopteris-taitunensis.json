    "intro": "Dryopteris taitunensis, commonly known as Taitung wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, particularly Taiwan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, often growing on soil or rock surfaces. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions."
