    "intro": "Draba caroliniana subsp. stellifera, commonly known as the Carolina rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowering period is brief, lasting only a few weeks, and it is often overlooked due to its modest appearance. The species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments and its role in supporting local pollinators."
