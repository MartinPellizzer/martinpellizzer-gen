    "intro": "Diceratium prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that spread along the ground to form dense mats. The fronds are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture and a dark green color. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
