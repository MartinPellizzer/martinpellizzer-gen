    "intro": "Diplazium conterminum, commonly known as the common cliff fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. Diplazium conterminum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
