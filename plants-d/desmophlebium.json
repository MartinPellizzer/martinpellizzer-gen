    "intro": "Desmophlebium, commonly known as the marsh hawksbeard, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit and is typically found in wet or marshy environments. The plants produce yellow composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Desmophlebium species have linear, grass-like leaves and are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil in wetlands. They are native to various regions across Europe and Asia."
