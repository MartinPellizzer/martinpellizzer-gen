It features delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The botanical structure of Diplazium velutinum reflects its adaptation to humid, tropical climates."
