    "intro": "Deyeuxia apsleyensis, commonly known as the Apsley sedge, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Due to its preference for wet environments, it is often found in areas with seasonal flooding."
