    "intro": "Dendrochilum liparidiflorum, commonly known as the golden-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow lip, which is a defining feature of the genus Dendrochilum. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually arranged in clusters and bloom during the warmer months. The botanical structure includes long, strap-like leaves and a complex, showy floral morphology typical of orchids."
