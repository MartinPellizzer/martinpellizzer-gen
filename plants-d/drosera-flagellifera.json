    "intro": "Drosera flagellifera, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swamps. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated by insects. Drosera flagellifera is a rosette-forming plant that thrives in humid conditions with ample sunlight."
