    "intro": "Dendrobium toressae, commonly known as the Sulu Dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It features a sympodial growth habit with numerous thin, often branched stems that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged in two rows along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Dendrobium toressae thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining substrates."
