It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences that are typically reddish-brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in pasture and erosion control due to its hardiness. This variety is known for its high tolerance to grazing and drought conditions."
