    "intro": "Drepanocarpus reniformis, commonly known as the round-leafed hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, yellow, or orange. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and as a landscape plant in tropical regions."
