    "intro": "Durabaculum jennyanum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late winter or early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its flowers are usually violet or purple in color, with a distinctive spurred petal that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Durabaculum jennyanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
