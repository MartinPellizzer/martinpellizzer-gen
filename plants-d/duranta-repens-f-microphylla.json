    "intro": "Duranta repens f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf duranta, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy dark green, providing a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom throughout the growing season. These flowers are followed by bright blue or purple berries that attract birds and other wildlife. It is well-suited for container gardening and as a groundcover due to its low-growing habit and adaptability to various soil types."
