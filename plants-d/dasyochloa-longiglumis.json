It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender glumes, which contribute to its common name. Dasyochloa longiglumis is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision."
