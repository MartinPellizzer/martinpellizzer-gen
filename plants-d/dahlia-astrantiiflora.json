    "intro": "Dahlia astrantiiflora, commonly known as the star-flowered dahlia, is a herbaceous perennial native to Mexico. It features showy, single or semi-double flowers with petals that often have a distinctive star-like appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet, with lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are dark green in color. Its tuberous roots are a key part of its growth cycle, allowing it to survive in temperate climates. The flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, adding vibrant color to gardens."
