    "intro": "Daphne comosa, commonly known as the spreading daphne, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, densely branched foliage with small, leathery leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or lilac, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its ornamental value lies in its compact form, winter interest, and long-lasting fragrance. Daphne comosa is generally hardy in USDA zones 7-9, though it may require protection in colder climates."
