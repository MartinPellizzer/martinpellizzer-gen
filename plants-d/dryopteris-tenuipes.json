    "intro": "Dryopteris tenuipes, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green and have a finely divided, feathery appearance. The plant prefers cool, moist, and shaded environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually over time. Dryopteris tenuipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
