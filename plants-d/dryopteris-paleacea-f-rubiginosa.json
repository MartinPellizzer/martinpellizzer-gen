    "intro": "Dryopteris paleacea f. rubiginosa, commonly known as the rusty cliff fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown fronds that give it its common name. It is a variant of the pale lady fern, native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often on cliffs or in open woodlands. Its fronds are lance-shaped, with a serrated margin and a pale underside, and they are usually upright and somewhat rigid. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained conditions."
