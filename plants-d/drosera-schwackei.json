    "intro": "Drosera schwackei, commonly known as the Schwaack's sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. Its leaves are usually small and clustered at the base, forming a rosette shape. Drosera schwackei is a popular species among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and ease of cultivation."
