It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Dorycnium kotschyanum is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which makes it useful in ecological restoration projects."
