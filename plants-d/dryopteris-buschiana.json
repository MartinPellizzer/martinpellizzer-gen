    "intro": "Dryopteris buschiana, commonly known as the Busch's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with high humidity and well-drained soil."
