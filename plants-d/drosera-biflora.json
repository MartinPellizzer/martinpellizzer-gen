    "intro": "Drosera biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky digestive fluid to trap insects. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands or wetlands. Drosera biflora is a low-growing plant that typically reaches a height of less than 10 centimeters."
