    "intro": "Dicksonia gomphophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of fertile fronds that produce spores, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil. The botanical features of Dicksonia gomphophylla make it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
