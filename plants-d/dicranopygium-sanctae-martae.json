    "intro": "Dicranopygium sanctae-martae, commonly known as the San Marta feather moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green, wiry leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests and montane regions. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. This moss plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
