    "intro": "Dendrobium cerasinum, commonly known as the red orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically red or pink in color, with a distinctive velvety texture. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium cerasinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
