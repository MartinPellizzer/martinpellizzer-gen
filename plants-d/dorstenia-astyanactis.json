    "intro": "Dorstenia astyanactis, commonly known as the spider plant or false arum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and unique inflorescence that resembles a spider's web, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spathe, which is a modified leaf that encloses the true flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Dorstenia astyanactis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
