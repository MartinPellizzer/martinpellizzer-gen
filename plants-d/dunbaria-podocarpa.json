    "intro": "Dunbaria podocarpa, commonly known as the New Zealand mountain hakea, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are leathery and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Dunbaria podocarpa is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions."
