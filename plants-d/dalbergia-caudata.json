    "intro": "Dalbergia caudata, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, delicate flowers. The tree produces hard, dark wood that is highly valued for its density and rich coloration. It is often found in dry, savanna-like habitats and can grow up to 15 meters in height. Due to its economic value, Dalbergia caudata is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
