    "intro": "Dryopteris obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It features fronds that are broadly ovate with a distinctive, slightly curled and serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fertile fronds produce spores in clusters, contributing to its reproductive cycle. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
