It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves. The plant features a stout, underground rhizome with fleshy, arrow-shaped leaves that grow in a distinctive spiral pattern. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Dupatya geniculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and unusual growth form."
