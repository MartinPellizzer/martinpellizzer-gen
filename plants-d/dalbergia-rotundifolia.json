    "intro": "Dalbergia rotundifolia, commonly known as Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical legume native to South America. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, oily texture and a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. Due to its high value for musical instruments and furniture, it has been heavily exploited, leading to conservation concerns."
