    "intro": "Delphinium dictyocarpum subsp. dictyocarpum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are arranged in racemes and attract various pollinators. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a coarse texture and are typically arranged alternately along the stem. This subspecies is adapted to cold, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
