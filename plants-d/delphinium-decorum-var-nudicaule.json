    "intro": "Delphinium decorum var. nudicaule, commonly known as the naked-stem delphinium, is a striking perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that often lack leaves along their lower portion, giving it its \"nudicaule\" designation. The plant produces tall spikes of showy blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitat."
