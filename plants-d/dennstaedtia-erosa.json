    "intro": "Dennstaedtia erosa, commonly known as the brittle fern, is a member of the Ophioglossaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant's spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are located on the underside of its fertile fronds. Its leaves are often described as being brittle and fragile, which contributes to its common name. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive strategy, with its spores dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation in suitable habitats."
