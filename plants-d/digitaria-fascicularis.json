    "intro": "Digitaria fascicularis, commonly known as flat-seeded grass or slender digit grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Digitaria fascicularis is valued in some regions for forage and has been studied for its potential in soil stabilization and erosion control."
