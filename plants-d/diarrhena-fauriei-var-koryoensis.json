It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dark green, lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
