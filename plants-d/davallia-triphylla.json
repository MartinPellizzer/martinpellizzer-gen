    "intro": "Davallia triphylla, commonly known as the mouse-tail fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that resemble mouse tails, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, horizontal stems that produce new fronds from the tips. Its leaves are compound, with each frond divided into three parts, and they are typically bright green with a leathery texture. Davallia triphylla prefers shady, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and indoor settings."
