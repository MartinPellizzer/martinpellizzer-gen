    "intro": "Dendrobium undulatum var. albertisianum, commonly known as the Albert's Wavering Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, arching inflorescences with pendulous, waxy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
