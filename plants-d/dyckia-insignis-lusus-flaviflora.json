    "intro": "Dyckia insignis lusus flaviflora, commonly known as the golden-flowered dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often adorned with a vibrant yellow stripe. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear showy, orange-red flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is prized for its ornamental value and ability to add a tropical flair to indoor or outdoor gardens."
