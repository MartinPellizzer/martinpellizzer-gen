    "intro": "Dracaena hendersonii, commonly known as the Henderson's dragon tree, is a striking tropical plant native to the island of Henderson in the Pitcairn Islands. It features tall, slender stems with dark green, elongated leaves that have a waxy texture and a slight sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena hendersonii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities."
