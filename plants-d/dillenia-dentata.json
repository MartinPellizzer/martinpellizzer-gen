    "intro": "Dillenia dentata, commonly known as the toothed dillenia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, often accompanied by a swollen, fleshy calyx. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments. Dillenia dentata is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
