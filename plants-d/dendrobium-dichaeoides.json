The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that are highly fragrant and bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in two rows along the stem. Dendrobium dichaeoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
