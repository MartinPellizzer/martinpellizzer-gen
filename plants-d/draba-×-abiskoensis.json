    "intro": "Draba \u00d7 abiskoensis, commonly known as the Abisko wintergrass, is a hybrid plant species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Scandinavia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the brief summer season. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Draba \u00d7 abiskoensis is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments and plays a role in stabilizing rocky and barren soils in its habitat."
