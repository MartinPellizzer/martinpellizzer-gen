    "intro": "Darea pectinata, commonly known as the woolly cushion plant, is a succulent species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form composed of small, fleshy, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its thick, waxy leaves store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Darea pectinata is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appearance."
