    "intro": "Dalbergia beccarii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its acoustic properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several flattened, dark seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
