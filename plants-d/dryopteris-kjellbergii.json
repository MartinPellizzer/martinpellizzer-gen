    "intro": "Dryopteris kjellbergii, commonly known as the Kjellberg's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of southern Scandinavia. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that form a dense, bushy crown. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are deciduous, turning brown and withering in the winter before regrowing in the spring."
