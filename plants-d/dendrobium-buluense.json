    "intro": "Dendrobium buluense, commonly known as the Buluense orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually narrow and\u9769\u8d28, providing structural support and aiding in photosynthesis. Dendrobium buluense thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
