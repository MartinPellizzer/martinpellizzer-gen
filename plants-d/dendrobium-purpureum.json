    "intro": "Dendrobium purpureum, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically purple or pink, with a striking, showy appearance that makes it popular in horticulture. Dendrobium purpureum thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
