    "intro": "Dichapetalum borneense, commonly known as the Bornean dichapetalum, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Dichapetalaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
