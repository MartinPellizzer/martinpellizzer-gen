It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the late spring and early summer.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
