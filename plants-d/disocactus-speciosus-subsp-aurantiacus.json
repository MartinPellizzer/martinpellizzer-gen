    "intro": "Disocactus speciosus subsp. aurantiacus, commonly known as the Orange Ghost Cactus, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy, powdery coating. The plant produces vibrant orange flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on long, slender peduncles. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
