It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and distinctive, fragrant flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to true mangosteens, though they are less commonly consumed. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The tree's ornamental value and potential medicinal properties make it a subject of botanical interest."
