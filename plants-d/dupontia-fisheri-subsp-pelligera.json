    "intro": "Dupontia fisheri subsp. pelligera, commonly known as the Pelligera sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it well-suited for stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
