    "intro": "Dalea sessilis, commonly known as the sessile milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Dalea sessilis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
