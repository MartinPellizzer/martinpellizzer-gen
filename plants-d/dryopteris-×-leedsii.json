    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 leedsii, commonly known as the Leeds fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octomeris. It is a medium-sized evergreen fern characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is well-suited for woodland gardens or as a ground cover. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming a compact, upright clump. The fronds are known for their durability and ability to retain their color throughout the winter, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
