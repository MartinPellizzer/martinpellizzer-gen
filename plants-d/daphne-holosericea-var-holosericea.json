    "intro": "Daphne holosericea var. holosericea, commonly known as the silver-leaf daphne, is a species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
