It is characterized by its spiral-arranged leaves that form a compact, spiral shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
