It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the common fig tree, though significantly smaller in size. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow-green in color. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America and thrives in warm, humid environments. Due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and bonsai cultivation."
