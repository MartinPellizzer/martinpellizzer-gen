It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its elliptical, serrated leaves that often exhibit a wavy or undulating margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, oval fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
