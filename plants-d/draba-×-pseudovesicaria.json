    "intro": "Draba \u00d7 pseudovesicaria, commonly known as the hybrid winter cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Draba verna and Draba nemorosa, characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are basal, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine or arctic habitats. Draba \u00d7 pseudovesicaria is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes."
