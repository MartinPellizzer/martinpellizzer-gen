    "intro": "Digitaria filiformis var. villosa, commonly known as silky grass or hairy digitaria, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and fine, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along water bodies. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
