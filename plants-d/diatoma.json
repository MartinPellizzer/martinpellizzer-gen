    "intro": "Diatoma, commonly known as a type of algae, is a unicellular organism belonging to the class Bacillariophyceae. It is characterized by its intricate silica cell walls, known as frustules, which are composed of two overlapping halves. These frustules often display elaborate patterns and are used for classification and identification. Diatom cells are typically microscopic, ranging from 2 to 200 micrometers in size. They play a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems as primary producers and as a food source for various aquatic organisms."
