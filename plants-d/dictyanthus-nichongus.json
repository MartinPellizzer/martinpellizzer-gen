    "intro": "Dictyanthus nichongus, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
