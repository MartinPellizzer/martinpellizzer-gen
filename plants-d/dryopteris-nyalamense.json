    "intro": "Dryopteris nyalamense, commonly known as the Nyalam wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into a complex arrangement of pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories at high altitudes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, protected by a thin, membranous covering. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
