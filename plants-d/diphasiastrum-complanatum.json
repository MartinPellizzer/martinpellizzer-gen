    "intro": "Diphasiastrum complanatum, commonly known as the common wood horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces two types of spore-bearing structures: strobila and sporangia, which are typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ancient appearance and primitive features make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
