    "intro": "Dioscorea chondrocarpa, commonly known as the rock yam, is a perennial herbaceous vine native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and tuberous roots. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its tubers are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though they are not as economically significant as other yam species. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments, showcasing resilience through its deep root system and drought tolerance."
