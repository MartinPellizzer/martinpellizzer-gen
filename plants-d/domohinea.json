    "intro": "Domohinea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, translucent leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden within its foliage. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Domohinea is considered a conservation concern."
