    "intro": "Distichlis australis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Australia and New Zealand. It is a perennial grass that thrives in saline and coastal environments, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to withstand salt spray and wind, making it an important stabilizer of coastal ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate extreme conditions makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
