    "intro": "Durabaculum sancristobalense, commonly known as the San Crist\u00f3bal durabaculum, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited geographic distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical specimen from habitat loss and environmental degradation."
