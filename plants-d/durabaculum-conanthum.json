    "intro": "Durabaculum conanthum, commonly known as the resilient stonebloom, is a hardy perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features a compact, succulent-like growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of blue and purple during the summer months. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Durabaculum conanthum is valued for its low maintenance and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
