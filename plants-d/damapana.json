    "intro": "Damapana, commonly known as the Indian nettle, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is characterized by its stinging hairs on the leaves and stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its heart-shaped leaves are usually arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Damapana is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
