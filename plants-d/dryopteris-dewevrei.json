    "intro": "Dryopteris dewevrei, commonly known as the Dewevre's wood fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated or lobed margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce multiple fertile and sterile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
