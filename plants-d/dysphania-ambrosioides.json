    "intro": "Dysphania ambrosioides, commonly known as Mexican spinach or amaranth, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features upright, branched stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, three-lobed seeds. It thrives in warm climates and is often grown as a leafy vegetable due to its mild, spinach-like flavor. Dysphania ambrosioides is also valued for its nutritional content, including high levels of vitamins and minerals."
