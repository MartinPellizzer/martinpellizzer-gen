It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of showy, blue to violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, which gives it its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.
