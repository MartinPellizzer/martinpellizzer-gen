    "intro": "Dryopteris cyrtolepis var. doiana, commonly known as the Doiana wood fern, is a variant of the cinnamon fern. It is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States, particularly in the southeastern region. The plant features a tall, slender, leafless stalk that bears a large, pinnately compound frond with a distinctive, curled fiddlehead at the tip. Its fronds are typically dark green with a rusty-brown midrib, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in woodland gardens."
