    "intro": "Dendrobium kerewense, commonly known as the Kerewense orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it a prized ornamental plant among orchid enthusiasts."
