It is characterized by its narrow, evergreen leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, woody capsules that contain numerous seeds. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in rocky or mountainous areas. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
