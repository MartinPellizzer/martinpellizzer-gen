    "intro": "Dendrobium vexillarius, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that often branch and bear clusters of fragrant, golden-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged in two rows along the stem. Its flowers are typically short-lived, blooming once or twice a year, and are prized for their vibrant color and ornamental value. Dendrobium vexillarius thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
