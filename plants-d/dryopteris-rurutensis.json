    "intro": "Dryopteris rurutensis, commonly known as the Japanese forest fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that spread along the ground. The plant produces large, bipinnate fronds that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color underneath. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. The spore-producing sori are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in curved lines."
