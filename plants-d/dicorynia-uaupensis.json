    "intro": "Dicorynia uaupensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rubber tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, and its fruits are three-valved capsules containing numerous seeds. Dicorynia uaupensis is notable for its historical use in the production of natural rubber, though it is less commonly cultivated today compared to Hevea brasiliensis. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various rainforest species."
