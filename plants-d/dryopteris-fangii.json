    "intro": "Dryopteris fangii, commonly known as the Fang's wood fern, is a species of polypod fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated or lobed margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
