    "intro": "Dioscorea ealensis, commonly known as the Ealens yam, is a species of flowering plant in the family Dioscoreaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Nigeria and Cameroon. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, vine-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped or ovate, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by edible tuberous roots. The tubers are often used as a food source and have been traditionally cultivated for their nutritional value."
