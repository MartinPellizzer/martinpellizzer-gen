    "intro": "Didymocarpus asperifolius, commonly known as the rough-leaved tamarind, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by woody pods containing edible, sour-tasting seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for its medicinal properties."
