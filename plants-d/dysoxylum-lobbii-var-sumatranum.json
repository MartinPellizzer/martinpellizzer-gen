    "intro": "Dysoxylum lobbii var. sumatranum, commonly known as the Sumatran satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany-like trees. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark wood and compound leaves with serrated margins. It typically grows in lowland rainforests and is valued for its hard, durable timber. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
