    "intro": "Dryopteris ensipinna, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-bearing clusters called sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually evergreen, remaining on the plant throughout the year, which contributes to its ornamental value in gardens."
