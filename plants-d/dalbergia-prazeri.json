    "intro": "Dalbergia prazeri, commonly known as the Pazer's rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the Fabaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and compound leaves with slender, pointed leaflets. It produces hard, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
