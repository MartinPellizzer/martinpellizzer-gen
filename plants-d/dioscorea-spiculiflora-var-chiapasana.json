    "intro": "Dioscorea spiculiflora var. chiapasana, commonly known as the Chiapas yam, is a climbing perennial vine native to Central America. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by tuberous roots that are the primary edible part. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments within forests. The tubers are valued for their starchy content and have been used traditionally in local cuisines."
