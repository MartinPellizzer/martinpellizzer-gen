    "intro": "Dovea microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited dovea, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with unique floral structures. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and smooth, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Dovea microcarpa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments."
