    "intro": "Dryopteris lorentzii, commonly known as the Lorentz's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a distinctive, intricate pattern of sori on the undersides of its leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Its rhizomes are robust and help it form dense colonies, making it a common sight in forest understories. The fronds are typically dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
