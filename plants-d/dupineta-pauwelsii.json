    "intro": "Dupineta pauwelsii, commonly known as the Pauwels' dwarf gentian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to violet flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Dupineta pauwelsii is considered a rare and specialized plant."
