    "intro": "Dendrobium margaretiae, commonly known as the Margaret's orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Dendrobium margaretiae thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
