    "intro": "Delphinium lineapetalum f. viscidum, commonly known as the sticky delphinium, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers. The leaves are palmately compound, with a velvety texture and a distinctive sticky secretion on the surface. This feature, which gives the plant its common name, is thought to deter herbivores and aid in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a desirable addition to rock gardens and alpine settings."
