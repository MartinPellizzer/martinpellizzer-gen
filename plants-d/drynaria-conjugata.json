    "intro": "Drynaria conjugata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a hardy evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features wiry, upright fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, creeping stem that can form dense colonies. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it thrives in shady, moist environments. Drynaria conjugata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience."
