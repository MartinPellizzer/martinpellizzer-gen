    "intro": "Draba incompta var. persica, commonly known as the Persian candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are basal, simple, and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in early spring, are usually white or pale pink, adding a delicate touch to its rocky environment."
