    "intro": "Dipsacus silvester, commonly known as the common teasel, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads that resemble small teasels, which are used in traditional crafts. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in woodland edges. Botanically, it belongs to the family Asteraceae, and its unique structure has made it a subject of both ecological and historical interest."
