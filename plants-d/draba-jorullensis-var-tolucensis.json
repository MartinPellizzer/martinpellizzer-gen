    "intro": "Draba jorullensis var. tolucensis, commonly known as the Tolucan whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant typically features a basal rosette of narrow, glaucous leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
