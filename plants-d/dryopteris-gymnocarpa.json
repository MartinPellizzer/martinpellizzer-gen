    "intro": "Dryopteris gymnocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-sheathed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance."
