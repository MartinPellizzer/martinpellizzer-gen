    "intro": "Dactylorhiza maculata subsp. elodes, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland and grassland habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, erect flowering stems with spikes of pale pink to white flowers. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, a common adaptation in orchids. The subspecies elodes is distinguished by its unique leaf markings and floral characteristics."
