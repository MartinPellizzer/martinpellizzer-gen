    "intro": "Dalzellia, commonly known as the rock fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants are characterized by their small, clustered leaves and unique, fig-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a fleshy, spiny structure. Dalzellia species are often shrubs or small trees, adapted to grow in rocky or arid environments. Their botanical features make them interesting subjects for ecological and horticultural study."
