    "intro": "Drakaea irritabilis, commonly known as the Shy Lady's Slipper, is an endangered orchid species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its unique, intricate flower structure with a pouch-like labellum and prominent, showy sepals and petals. The plant typically grows in heathlands and sandy soils, thriving in areas with specific moisture and light conditions. Its blooming period occurs during the cooler months, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
