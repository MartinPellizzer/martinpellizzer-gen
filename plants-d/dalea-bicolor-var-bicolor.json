    "intro": "Dalea bicolor var. bicolor, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid conditions. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
