It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is often found in prairie and woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Desmanthus caudatus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
