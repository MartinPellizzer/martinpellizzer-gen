    "intro": "Dinebra panicea, commonly known as the panicled dune grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy, saline environments, often found on dunes and coastal plains. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which are open, branched inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Dinebra panicea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
