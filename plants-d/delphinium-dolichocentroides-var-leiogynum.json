    "intro": "Delphinium dolichocentroides var. leiogynum, commonly known as the smoothleaf larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, distinguishing it from other larkspur varieties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in mountainous regions. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
