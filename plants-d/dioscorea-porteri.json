    "intro": "Dioscorea porteri, commonly known as the African yam bean, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tendrils and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by tuberous roots that are used as food. Its tubers are rich in starch and have a nutty flavor, making them an important crop in some regions. Dioscorea porteri thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
