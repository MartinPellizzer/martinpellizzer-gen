    "intro": "Dryopteris patens var. tarapotensis, commonly known as the Tarapoto holly fern, is a species of fern native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinct, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
