    "intro": "Dichanthelium pinetorum, commonly known as the pinegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils, often found in pine forests and open woodlands. The plant has slender, cylindrical leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the grass family. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it is adapted to full sun to partial shade conditions. Dichanthelium pinetorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystem."
