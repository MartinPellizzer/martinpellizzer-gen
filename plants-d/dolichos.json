    "intro": "Dolichos, commonly known as the horsegram or urad, is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, bean-like pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with trifoliate leaves and small white or purple flowers. Dolichos is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a valuable crop in regions with limited rainfall. Its botanical features make it both an important food source and a useful plant for soil enrichment."
