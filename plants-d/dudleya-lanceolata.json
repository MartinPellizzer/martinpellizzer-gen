    "intro": "Dudleya lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to California. It features rosettes of fleshy, narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid environments."
