    "intro": "Didymocarpus obtusus, commonly known as the blunt-leaved sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
