    "intro": "Diplima stipularis, commonly known as the stipular diploma, is a unique flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive stipules, which are modified leaf structures that often resemble small, leaf-like appendages at the base of the leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental appeal. Diplima stipularis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural and ecological studies."
