    "intro": "Duretia palustris, commonly known as the marsh duretia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer. Its flowering stems are often erect and can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. Duretia palustris plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
