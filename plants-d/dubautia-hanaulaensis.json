    "intro": "Dubautia hanaulaensis, commonly known as Hanaula false heather, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms with pink to red flowers, which attract various pollinators such as bees and birds. Dubautia hanaulaensis is often found in rocky soils and coastal areas, thriving in the unique microclimates of Hawaii. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its native range."
