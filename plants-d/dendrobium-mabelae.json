    "intro": "Dendrobium mabelae, commonly known as the Mabel's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive red or purple lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Dendrobium mabelae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its beauty and unique floral structure."
