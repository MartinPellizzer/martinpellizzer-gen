    "intro": "Diapensia lapponica var. genuina, commonly known as the Lapland sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer, typically in open, rocky, or sandy habitats. The plant has a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its botanical structure reflects its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, cold, and windy conditions."
