    "intro": "Dryopteris lepidopoda var. phaeocoma, commonly known as the dark-fringed wood fern, is a variant of the broad-ferns family (Dryopteridaceae). It is characterized by its dark, glossy fronds that are often adorned with distinctive, wavy margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
