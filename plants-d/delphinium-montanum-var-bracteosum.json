    "intro": "Delphinium montanum var. bracteosum, commonly known as the bracteate larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. This variety is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
