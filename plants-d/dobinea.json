It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae, which includes many showy flowering plants. Dobinea has heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. The plant is often found in moist, shaded woodland areas and is known for its rapid growth. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily and form dense mats."
