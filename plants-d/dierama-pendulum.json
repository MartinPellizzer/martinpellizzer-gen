    "intro": "Dierama pendulum, commonly known as the hanging lily, is a striking South African plant characterized by its long, drooping inflorescences. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its showy flowers. The plant produces clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Dierama pendulum is often used in rock gardens or as a container plant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
