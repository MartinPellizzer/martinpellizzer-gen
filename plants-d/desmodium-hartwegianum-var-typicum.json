It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
