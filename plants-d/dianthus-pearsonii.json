    "intro": "Dianthus pearsonii, commonly known as the Sierra dianthus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Dianthus pearsonii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant landscaping."
