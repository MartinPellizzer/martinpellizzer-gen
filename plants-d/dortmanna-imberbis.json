    "intro": "Dortmanna imberbis, commonly known as the hairless dock, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes other familiar plants like sorrel and knotweed. The plant typically features smooth, waxy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, greenish flowers in late spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its lack of hairy surfaces gives it its common name, and it is often found growing in association with other moisture-loving plants."
