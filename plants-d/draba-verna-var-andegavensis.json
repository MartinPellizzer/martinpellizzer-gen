    "intro": "Draba verna var. andegavensis, commonly known as the early whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is notable for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude areas."
