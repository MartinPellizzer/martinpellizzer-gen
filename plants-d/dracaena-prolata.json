    "intro": "Dracaena prolata, commonly known as the weeping dracaena, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its cascading, pendulous leaves that give it a distinctive, waterfall-like appearance. The plant has dark green, narrow leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern at the tips of its branched stems. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Dracaena prolata is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
