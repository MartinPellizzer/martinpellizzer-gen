    "intro": "Deparia ghangaria, commonly known as the Ghangari brake fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of the Himalayas. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Deparia ghangaria plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
