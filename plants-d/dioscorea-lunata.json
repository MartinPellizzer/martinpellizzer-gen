    "intro": "Dioscorea lunata, commonly known as the moon vine, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its long, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by tuberous roots, which are the primary part used in traditional medicine. Its tubers are also used as a food source in some cultures, though they contain toxic compounds that require careful processing. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
