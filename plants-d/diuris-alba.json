    "intro": "Diuris alba, commonly known as the white spider-orchid, is a striking orchid species native to eastern Australia. It features a single, delicate white flower with a distinctive, spider-like appearance, which is a key characteristic of the genus Diuris. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in open habitats, often in coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a short, erect stem. Diuris alba is known for its ephemeral blooming period, usually occurring in late winter to early spring."
