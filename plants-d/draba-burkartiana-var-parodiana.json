    "intro": "Draba burkartiana var. parodiana, commonly known as the Parodian whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of yellow or white flowers in spring. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often found in areas with poor soil and high sunlight exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
