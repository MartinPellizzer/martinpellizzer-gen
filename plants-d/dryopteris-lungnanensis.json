    "intro": "Dryopteris lungnanensis, commonly known as the Lungnan Shield Fern, is a species of shield fern native to China. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, rugged texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
