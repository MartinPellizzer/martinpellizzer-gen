    "intro": "Dimorphotheca fruticosa, commonly known as the golden crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with a distinctive crown-like structure, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
