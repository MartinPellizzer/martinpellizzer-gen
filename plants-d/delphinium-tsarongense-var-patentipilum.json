    "intro": "Delphinium tsarongense var. patentipilum, commonly known as the Tibetan larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, bearing clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. This variety is notable for its distinctive, patent-pilose (hairy) leaves and its ability to thrive in cold, mountainous climates. It is often found in rocky soils and is an important plant in the alpine flora of Central Asia."
