    "intro": "Dendrobium capituliflorum, commonly known as the clustered dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that often branch and produce numerous pseudobulbs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
