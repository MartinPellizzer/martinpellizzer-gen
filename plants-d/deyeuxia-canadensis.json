    "intro": "Deyeuxia canadensis, commonly known as Canada bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and forms dense, mat-like growth. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It has small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Deyeuxia canadensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
