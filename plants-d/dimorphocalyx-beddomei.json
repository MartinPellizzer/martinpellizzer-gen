    "intro": "Dimorphocalyx beddomei, commonly known as the Beddome's dimorphic calyx, is a rare flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its unique dimorphic calyx, which consists of two different types of sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats and has small, white or pale pink flowers. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, fleshy berries as its fruit. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
