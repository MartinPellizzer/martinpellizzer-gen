    "intro": "Dryopteris jaculosa, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are typically dark green, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, serrated margin. It produces spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round groups. This plant is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
