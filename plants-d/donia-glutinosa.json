    "intro": "Donia glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky donia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sticky resinous sap, which gives it its common name and contributes to its unique ecological role. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible in some cultures. The plant's sticky properties have made it useful in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive."
