    "intro": "Draba incurvata, commonly known as the bent-leaved whitlow grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, basal leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are typically arranged in a raceme. Draba incurvata thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as cabbages and mustards."
