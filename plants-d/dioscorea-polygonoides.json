    "intro": "Dioscorea polygonoides, commonly known as the African yam, is a climbing vine belonging to the Dioscoreaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by tuberous roots, which are its primary economic product. These tubers are an important food source and have been used traditionally for their nutritional value. The species is also valued for its potential in pharmaceutical applications due to the presence of bioactive compounds."
