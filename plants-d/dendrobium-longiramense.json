It features a sympodial growth habit with numerous, often branched stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged spirally along the stems, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Dendrobium longiramense thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
