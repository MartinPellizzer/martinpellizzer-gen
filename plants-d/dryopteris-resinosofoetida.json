    "intro": "Dryopteris resinosofoetida, commonly known as the resinous stink fern, is a member of the fern family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are often covered in a waxy, resinous coating, which gives it its distinctive appearance and scent. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are borne on the undersides of its fronds, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. This species is notable for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its unique chemical composition that contributes to its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor."
