    "intro": "Ditoca muscosa, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure composed of a flat, leaf-like body that is often covered in a layer of tiny, scale-like structures. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the upper surface of the thallus. This species is an important component of many ecosystems, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
