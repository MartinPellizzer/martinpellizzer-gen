    "intro": "Dendrobium montis-sellae, commonly known as the mountain Sellae orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms during the spring and early summer, and its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Dendrobium montis-sellae prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for cultivated gardens. Its unique appearance and delicate fragrance make it a desirable ornamental plant."
