    "intro": "Diplazium pin-faense, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist conditions. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern."
