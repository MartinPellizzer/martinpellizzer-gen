    "intro": "Distictella obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate distictella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. The plant features lanceolate to obovate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct, waxy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in the spring. Distictella obovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
