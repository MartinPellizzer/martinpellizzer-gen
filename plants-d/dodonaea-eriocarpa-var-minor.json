    "intro": "Dodonaea eriocarpa var. minor, commonly known as the silky Dodonaea, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. These flowers are followed by small, woody fruits that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia."
