    "intro": "Delphinium exaltatum, commonly known as the tall larkspur, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, bearing clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Its flowers are typically arranged in racemes and bloom in late spring to early summer. Delphinium exaltatum is valued in gardens for its striking appearance but is toxic to humans and animals due to its alkaloid content."
