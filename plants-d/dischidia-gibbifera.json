    "intro": "Dischidia gibbifera, commonly known as the swollen leaf dischidia, is a climbing or trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its unique, swollen, fleshy leaves that often resemble small pouches or cups. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in clusters. Its leaves are adapted for storing water, making it well-suited for arid or semi-arid environments. Dischidia gibbifera is often grown as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
