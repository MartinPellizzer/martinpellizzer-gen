    "intro": "Drymonia killipii, commonly known as the Killip's drymonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features include small, leathery leaves and clusters of pale pink to white blooms that appear in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
