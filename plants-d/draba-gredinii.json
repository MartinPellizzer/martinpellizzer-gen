    "intro": "Draba gredinii, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the high mountain regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats to withstand harsh conditions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of hairs to reduce water loss. Draba gredinii is known for its early blooming period, often flowering in late spring to early summer."
