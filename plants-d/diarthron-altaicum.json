    "intro": "Diarthron altaicum, commonly known as the highland grass or alpine grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, greenish or brownish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to poor, well-drained soils. Diarthron altaicum plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
