    "intro": "Dryopteris sweetiorum, commonly known as the sweet fern fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a distinctive, silvery-white bloom. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically evergreen, retaining their color throughout the year, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
