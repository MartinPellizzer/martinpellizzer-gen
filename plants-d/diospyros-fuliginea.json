    "intro": "Diospyros fuliginea, commonly known as the black sapote, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to edible fruits. The fruit has a thick, inedible rind and a soft, creamy, sweet flesh that turns from yellow to black as it ripens. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture-making."
