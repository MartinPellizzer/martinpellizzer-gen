    "intro": "Diectomis, commonly known as the African orchid, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its elegant, often fragrant flowers. The plants typically have tall, slender stems with broad, lance-shaped leaves. Diectomis species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, often in forest canopies. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
