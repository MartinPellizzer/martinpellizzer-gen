    "intro": "Dematra petiolata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dematra, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters. Its root system is fibrous, and the plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas. Dematra petiolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
