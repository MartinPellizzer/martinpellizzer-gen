    "intro": "Doryopteris geraniifolia, commonly known as the lady fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the petals of a flower, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
