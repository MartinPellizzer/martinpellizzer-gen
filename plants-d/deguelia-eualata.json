    "intro": "Deguelia eualata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, flat, compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color, though it is also used in traditional medicine. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
