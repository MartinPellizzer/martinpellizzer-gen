    "intro": "Diptera, commonly known as flies, is an order of insects that includes over 150,000 described species. While not a plant, Diptera is often associated with plants due to its role in pollination and plant decomposition. Many species feed on nectar, pollen, or plant sap, contributing to ecological interactions. Some Diptera, like hoverflies, mimic bees and wasps for protection. Their life cycles often involve aquatic or moist environments, influencing their botanical relationships."
