    "intro": "Davallia botrychioides var. multifida, commonly known as the feather fern, is a striking fern with distinctive, finely divided fronds that resemble delicate feathers. It originates from tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, with a unique ability to glow in the dark due to the presence of luciferin. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
