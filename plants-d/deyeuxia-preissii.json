    "intro": "Deyeuxia preissii, commonly known as the narrowleaf flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 meter in height, with a distinct flowering stem that bears small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems. Deyeuxia preissii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
