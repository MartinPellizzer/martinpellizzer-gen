    "intro": "Diplazium cornutum, commonly known as the horned fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a rosette of lanceolate, dark green fronds that are often adorned with small, spiny projections along their margins. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
