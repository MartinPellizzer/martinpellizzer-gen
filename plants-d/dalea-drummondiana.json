    "intro": "Dalea drummondiana, commonly known as Drummond's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Dalea drummondiana is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its role in supporting local pollinators."
