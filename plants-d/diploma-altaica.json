    "intro": "Diploma altaica, commonly known as the Altai diploma plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, delicate white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its leaves are finely divided and have a mild, aromatic scent, while its flowers bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
