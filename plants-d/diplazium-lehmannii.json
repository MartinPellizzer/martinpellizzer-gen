    "intro": "Diplazium lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Diplazium lehmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
