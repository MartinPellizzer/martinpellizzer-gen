    "intro": "Dryopteris oreades, commonly known as the mountain fern or rock fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky slopes or in woodlands. Its rhizomes are robust and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Dryopteris oreades is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
