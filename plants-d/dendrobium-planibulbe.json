    "intro": "Dendrobium planibulbe, commonly known as the flat bulb orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white, yellow, or pink. Dendrobium planibulbe thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
