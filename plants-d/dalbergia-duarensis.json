    "intro": "Dalbergia duarensis, commonly known as the Duaren rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant features bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several elongated seeds. Due to its limited distribution and susceptibility to overharvesting, Dalbergia duarensis is considered a threatened species."
