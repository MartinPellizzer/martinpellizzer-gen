    "intro": "Dendropanax stellatus, commonly known as the star-leaved arrowleaf, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant belongs to the Araliaceae family and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Dendropanax stellatus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
