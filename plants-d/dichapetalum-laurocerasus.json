    "intro": "Dichapetalum laurocerasus, commonly known as the European holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that remain on the plant throughout the winter, giving it a striking appearance during the colder months. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. Its evergreen foliage and ornamental berries make it a popular choice for hedging and ornamental gardening. However, it is considered toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of saponins in its berries."
