    "intro": "Dryopteris praetermissa, commonly known as the southern wood fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive, narrow, and elongated shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction."
