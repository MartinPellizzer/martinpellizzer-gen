    "intro": "Dactylorhiza maculata subsp. saccifera, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, purple or pinkish-purple flowers in late summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike bearing several showy flowers, each with a three-lobed lip. The subspecies is distinguished by its distinctive spotted leaves and its preference for specific soil conditions."
