    "intro": "Dendrobium acutimentum, commonly known as the sharp-angled dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces racemes of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers with prominent yellow lips. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged along the pseudobulbs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Dendrobium acutimentum thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
