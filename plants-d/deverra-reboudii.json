    "intro": "Deverra reboudii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Deverra reboudii is valued for its resilience and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
