    "intro": "Dalea emoryi, commonly known as Emory's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink to red in color, and it has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry climates. Dalea emoryi is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
