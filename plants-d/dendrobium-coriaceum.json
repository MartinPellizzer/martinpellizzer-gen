    "intro": "Dendrobium coriaceum, commonly known as the tough leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers during the summer months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for both horticultural and conservation purposes."
