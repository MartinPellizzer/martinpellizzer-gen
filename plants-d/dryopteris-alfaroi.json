    "intro": "Dryopteris alfaroi, commonly known as the Alfaroi wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the Dryopteris genus. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a light green coloration. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant's spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus."
