    "intro": "Drymaria paposana var. paposana, commonly known as the white sandplant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and coastal climates. The plant features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers. It is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. This species is valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
