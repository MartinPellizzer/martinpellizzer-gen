    "intro": "Dendrophthora elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale green berries that are toxic to mammals. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects. Its life cycle involves the dispersal of its seeds through the droppings of birds that consume its berries."
