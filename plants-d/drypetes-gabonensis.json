It is characterized by its dense, dark brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly glossy surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. The tree is typically found in lowland rainforests and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
