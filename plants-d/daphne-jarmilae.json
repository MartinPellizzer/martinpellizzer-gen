    "intro": "Daphne jarmilae, commonly known as the Jarmilae daphne, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, glossy dark green foliage that provides a lush backdrop for its showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces clusters of waxy, pinkish-white blooms in late winter to early spring, adding a burst of color during the colder months. Its leaves are leathery and aromatic, emitting a subtle, spicy scent when crushed. Daphne jarmilae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in well-drained soils."
