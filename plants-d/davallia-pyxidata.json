    "intro": "Davallia pyxidata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant grows in dense clusters, with rhizomes that spread horizontally along the soil surface. It prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets that give it a compact and elegant appearance."
