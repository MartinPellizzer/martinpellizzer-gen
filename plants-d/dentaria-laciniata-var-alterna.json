    "intro": "Dentaria laciniata var. alterna, commonly known as the alternate toothwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, toothed leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early spring. Its unique feature is the presence of a fleshy, root-like structure called a caudex, which stores nutrients. The alternate toothwort thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
