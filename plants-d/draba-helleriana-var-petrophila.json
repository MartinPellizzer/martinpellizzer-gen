    "intro": "Draba helleriana var. petrophila, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces delicate, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas."
