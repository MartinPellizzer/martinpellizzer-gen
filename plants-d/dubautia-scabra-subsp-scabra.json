    "intro": "Dubautia scabra subsp. scabra, commonly known as the rough Dubautia, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its grayish-green, fuzzy leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and upland habitats. It plays a role in the ecological systems of its native range, supporting local pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
