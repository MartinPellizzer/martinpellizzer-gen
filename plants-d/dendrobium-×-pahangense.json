    "intro": "Dendrobium \u00d7 pahangense, commonly known as the Pahang orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange with dark markings, and they bloom in late summer or early autumn. Dendrobium \u00d7 pahangense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
