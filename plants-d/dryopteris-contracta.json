    "intro": "Dryopteris contracta, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a cinnamon stick. It is native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a tall, slender, unbranched sterile stalk topped with a large, compound fertile frond. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. The cinnamon fern is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
