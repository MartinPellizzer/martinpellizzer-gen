    "intro": "Didiscus sarasinorum, commonly known as the Sarasin's didiscus, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a crown. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
