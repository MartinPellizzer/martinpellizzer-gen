It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features a slender, hairy stem and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with short, rounded spurs. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. This orchid is valued for its unique floral structure and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental appeal."
