It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with hairy margins. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in racemes, followed by bright red berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
