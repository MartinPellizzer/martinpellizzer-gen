    "intro": "Dichrostachys bernieriana, commonly known as the African burr legume, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, followed by woody, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a source of forage for livestock."
