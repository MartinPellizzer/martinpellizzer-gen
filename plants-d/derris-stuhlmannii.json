    "intro": "Derris stuhlmannii, commonly known as the African snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its roots contain toxic alkaloids, which have been used traditionally for their medicinal and pesticidal properties. However, due to its poisonous nature, it requires careful handling and is not commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes."
