It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of small, pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve water in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
