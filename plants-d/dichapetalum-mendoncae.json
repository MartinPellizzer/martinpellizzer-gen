    "intro": "Dichapetalum mendoncae, commonly known as Mendenhall's dichapetalum, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a reddish hue. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
