    "intro": "Dryopteris caudifolia, commonly known as the horse's tail fern, is a species of polypody fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that resemble a horse's tail, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it can form dense colonies over time. Dryopteris caudifolia is a hardy perennial that thrives in USDA hardiness zones 4 through 8."
