    "intro": "Dianthus sylvestris var. humilior, commonly known as the woodland campion, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, pink or white flowers with five petals, often arranged in a cluster at the end of each stem. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, aiding in moisture retention. It thrives in woodland understories and rocky soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
