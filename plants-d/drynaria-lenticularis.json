    "intro": "Drynaria lenticularis, commonly known as the lens fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lens-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
