    "intro": "Dryas integrifolia subsp. integrifolia, commonly known as the alpine avens, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. This subspecies is notable for its hibernating buds, which allow it to survive harsh winter conditions."
