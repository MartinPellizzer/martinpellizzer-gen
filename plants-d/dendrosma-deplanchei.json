    "intro": "Dendrosma deplanchei, commonly known as the Desert Honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in spring. Its floral structure is typical of the Lamiales order, featuring tubular corollas and stamens that are adapted for pollination by insects. Dendrosma deplanchei is well-suited to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or rocky soils."
