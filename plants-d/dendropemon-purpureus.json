    "intro": "Dendropemon purpureus, commonly known as the purple flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features showy, violet-pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses for its unique floral display."
