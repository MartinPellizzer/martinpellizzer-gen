    "intro": "Dracula vagabunda, commonly known as the wandering vampire orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, dark red flowers that resemble a bat's face, a feature that contributes to its dramatic common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and debris. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Dracula vagabunda is considered endangered."
