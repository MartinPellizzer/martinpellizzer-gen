    "intro": "Diasperus glaucogynus, commonly known as the blue milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in umbels, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, a common trait among plants in the Apocynaceae family. Diasperus glaucogynus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky habitats."
