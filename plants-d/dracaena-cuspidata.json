It features long, narrow, dark green leaves that are often stiff and pointed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and minimal water requirements.
