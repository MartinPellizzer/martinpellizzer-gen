    "intro": "Dryopteris chupengensis, commonly known as the Chupeng wood fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate or tripinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically arranged along the margins of the fronds. This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
