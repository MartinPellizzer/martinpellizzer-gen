    "intro": "Dendrobium lucens, commonly known as the shining orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, showy appearance. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Dendrobium lucens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
