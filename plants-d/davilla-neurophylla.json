    "intro": "Davilla neurophylla, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that attract birds. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Davilla neurophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
