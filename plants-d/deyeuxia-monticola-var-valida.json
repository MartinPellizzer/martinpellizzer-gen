    "intro": "Deyeuxia monticola var. valida, commonly known as the mountain false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. This variety is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
