    "intro": "Dracaena undulata, commonly known as the wavy dracaena, is a tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, wavy, and often variegated leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a smooth, grayish-green bark. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena undulata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
