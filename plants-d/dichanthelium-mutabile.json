    "intro": "Dichanthelium mutabile, commonly known as the variable panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stem. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green hue, with hairy surfaces that aid in water retention. Dichanthelium mutabile is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is a common component of wetland and coastal grassland ecosystems."
