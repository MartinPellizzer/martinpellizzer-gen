    "intro": "Droguetia woodii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and often covered in a waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
