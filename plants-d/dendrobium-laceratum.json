    "intro": "Dendrobium laceratum, commonly known as the split-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant features long, thin stems that are often branched and covered in a dense layer of roots. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, and it produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow. Dendrobium laceratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its beauty and resilience."
