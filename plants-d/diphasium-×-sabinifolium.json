    "intro": "Diphasium \u00d7 sabinifolium, commonly known as the sabinifolium hybrid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Diphasium lanceolatum and Diphasium sabinifolium. It is a shrub characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is native to regions in South America, particularly in the Andes. Due to its medicinal properties and ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
