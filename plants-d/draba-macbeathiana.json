    "intro": "Draba macbeathiana, commonly known as the MacBeath's whitlow grass, is a small, flowering plant native to the alpine regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
