    "intro": "Dryopteris austriaca var. intermedia, commonly known as the Austrian wood fern, is a perennial fern characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate or tri-pinnate. It originates from the mountainous regions of Central Europe, including Austria and the Alps. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus."
