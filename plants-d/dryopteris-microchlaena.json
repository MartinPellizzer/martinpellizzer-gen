    "intro": "Dryopteris microchlaena, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often arched or curved, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The plant's rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor it in the soil while absorbing nutrients."
