    "intro": "Daviesia umbellulata var. dietrichiae, commonly known as the Dietrich's hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Proteaceae family. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal regions."
