    "intro": "Dacrydium balansae, commonly known as the New Caledonian pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the island of New Caledonia. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in humid, mountainous regions with acidic soils. The plant has needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around the stems, and it produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the unique biodiversity of the region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specialization, it is considered a vulnerable species."
