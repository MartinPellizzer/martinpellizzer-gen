    "intro": "Dupatya pubescens, commonly known as the hairy leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts. Dupatya pubescens plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
