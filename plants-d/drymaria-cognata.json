    "intro": "Drymaria cognata, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy, kidney-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils, often found in disturbed habitats. Drymaria cognata is known for its ability to spread via stolons, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
