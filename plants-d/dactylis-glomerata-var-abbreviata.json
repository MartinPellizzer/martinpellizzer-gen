    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed goat's rue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, tufted clusters of short, stiff leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to brown flowers in dense, spherical inflorescences, which are typically found at the base of the plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
