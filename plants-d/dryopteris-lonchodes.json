    "intro": "Dryopteris lonchodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The fronds are often divided into narrow segments, giving the plant a feathery appearance."
