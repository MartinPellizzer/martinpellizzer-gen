    "intro": "Dendrolobium cheelii, commonly known as the Cheel's burr legume, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is adapted to dry environments, featuring small, leathery leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive spurred petal, and it produces hairy, woody pods that contain flattened seeds. Dendrolobium cheelii is often found in sandy soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
