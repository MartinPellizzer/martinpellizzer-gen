    "intro": "Dichrocephala tanacetoides, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb with erect, branching stems and hairy leaves. Its yellow flowers bloom in clusters, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds similar to those of dandelions. The plant is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, and it has some medicinal uses in traditional African medicine."
