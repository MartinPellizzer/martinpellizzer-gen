It is a perennial herb with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically succulent, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
