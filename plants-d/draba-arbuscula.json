    "intro": "Draba arbuscula, commonly known as the dwarf whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and typically grows in alpine and arctic regions. The plant has a low-growing habit with dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Draba arbuscula is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor conditions."
