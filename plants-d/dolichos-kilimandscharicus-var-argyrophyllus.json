    "intro": "Dolichos kilimandscharicus var. argyrophyllus, commonly known as the silver-leaf dolichos, is a climbing legume native to the highlands of East Africa. It is characterized by its striking silver-white foliage, which contrasts with its dark green stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and potential nutritional benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
