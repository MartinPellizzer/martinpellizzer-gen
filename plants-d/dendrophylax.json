    "intro": "Dendrophylax, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's unique appearance includes long, narrow leaves and a single, delicate flower that resembles a ghostly figure. Dendrophylax thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
