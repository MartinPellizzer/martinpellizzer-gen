    "intro": "Dorema glabrum, commonly known as the smooth dorema, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green in color, and covered in a fine layer of whitish wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Dorema glabrum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in regions with limited rainfall."
