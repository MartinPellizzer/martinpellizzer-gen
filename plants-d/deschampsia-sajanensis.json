    "intro": "Deschampsia sajanensis, commonly known as the Sajansky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, tufted clumps. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, two-rowed spikelets. Deschampsia sajanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
