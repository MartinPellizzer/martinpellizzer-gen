    "intro": "Dyssodia incana, commonly known as the woolly dyssodia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its grayish, hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Dyssodia incana is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging climates."
