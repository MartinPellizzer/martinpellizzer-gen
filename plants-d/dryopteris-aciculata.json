    "intro": "Dryopteris aciculata, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, needle-like fronds that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris aciculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
