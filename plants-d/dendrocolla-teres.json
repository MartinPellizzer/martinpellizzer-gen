    "intro": "Dendrocolla teres, commonly known as the rounded tree fern, is a unique plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its thick, tree-like trunk covered in a layer of fibrous roots. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Dendrocolla teres is often found in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological significance."
