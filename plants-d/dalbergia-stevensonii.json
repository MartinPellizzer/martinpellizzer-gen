It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant typically grows in humid, well-drained soils and thrives in warm climates with adequate rainfall. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to its ornamental value and timber quality, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and horticultural collections."
