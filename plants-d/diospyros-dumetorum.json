    "intro": "Diospyros dumetorum, commonly known as the Indian persimmon or wild persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family, which includes ebony and persimmon trees. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are typically dioecious, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns from green to orange-red when ripe, containing a single seed."
