    "intro": "Drosera modesta, commonly known as the common sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant's leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called tentacles, which secrete a mucilaginous substance to immobilize prey. Drosera modesta typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It is a perennial plant that produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months."
