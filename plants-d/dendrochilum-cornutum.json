It features a distinctive appearance with long, slender pseudobulbs and linear, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences bearing showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white. Its unique horn-like structures on the flower stems give it its common name. Dendrochilum cornutum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
