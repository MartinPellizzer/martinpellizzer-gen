    "intro": "Dalbergia decipularis, commonly known as the false ebony, is a species of leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that resembles ebony, though it is not as valuable or dense as true ebony. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several rounded seeds. The tree is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its timber in local markets."
