    "intro": "Dendrobium singaporense, commonly known as the Singapore orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
