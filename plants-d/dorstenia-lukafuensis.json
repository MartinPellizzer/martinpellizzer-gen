It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
