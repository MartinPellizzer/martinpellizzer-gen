    "intro": "Dalbergia mammosa, commonly known as the rosewood tree, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and rich aroma. The plant has compound leaves with trifoliate or pinnate arrangements, and its flowers are typically small and pale pink to white. It produces pods that contain flat, elongated seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils in tropical climates. Due to its economic value, it is also a species of concern for overharvesting and habitat loss."
