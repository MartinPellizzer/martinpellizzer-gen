    "intro": "Draba polyphylla, commonly known as the Sierra draba, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Draba polyphylla is often found in meadows and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
