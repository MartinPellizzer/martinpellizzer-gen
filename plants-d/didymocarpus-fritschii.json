    "intro": "Didymocarpus fritschii, commonly known as the Fritsch's didymocarp, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release seeds, a feature typical of many members of the Rubiaceae family. It is often found in moist, shaded environments and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
