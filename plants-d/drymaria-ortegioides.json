    "intro": "Drymaria ortegioides, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers, typically blooming in spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils. Drymaria ortegioides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
