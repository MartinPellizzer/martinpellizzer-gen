    "intro": "Draba laxa var. intermedia, commonly known as the Intermediate Rockcress, is a low-growing flowering plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Eurasia. It typically forms dense mats or cushions, with small, basal leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in mountainous environments where it is adapted to cold and harsh conditions. Its flowers are usually arranged in clusters and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. Draba laxa var. intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude habitats."
