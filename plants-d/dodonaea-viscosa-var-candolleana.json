    "intro": "Dodonaea viscosa var. candolleana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hop bush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in traditional medicine."
