    "intro": "Dryopteris wallichiana subsp. coriacea, commonly known as the thick-leaved wood fern, is a fern species native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often slightly curled at the edges. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are typically grouped in clusters."
