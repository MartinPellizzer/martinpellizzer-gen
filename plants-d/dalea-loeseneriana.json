    "intro": "Dalea loeseneriana, commonly known as the pink prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its showy, pink to reddish-purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and it has small, trifoliate leaves. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which help improve soil fertility. Dalea loeseneriana is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability."
