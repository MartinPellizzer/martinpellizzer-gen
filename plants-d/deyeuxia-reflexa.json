    "intro": "Deyeuxia reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-sided spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of its stems. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Deyeuxia reflexa is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate varying moisture conditions."
