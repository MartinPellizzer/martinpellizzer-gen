    "intro": "Dialium trifoliolatum, commonly known as the three-leaved flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting various pollinators. The plant has trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is composed of three leaflets, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation. The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
