    "intro": "Danaea antillensis, commonly known as the Caribbean flame flower, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean region. It is a member of the Commelinaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that resemble flames. The plant features strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. Danaea antillensis typically grows as a perennial shrub, often found in moist, shaded areas near rivers and streams. Its striking appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
