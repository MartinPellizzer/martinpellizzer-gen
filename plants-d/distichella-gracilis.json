    "intro": "Distichella gracilis, commonly known as the slender feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, slender blades that grow in pairs along the stem, giving it a distinctive feathery appearance. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its flowering spikes are small and inconspicuous, producing minute seeds that are dispersed by wind. Distichella gracilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native wetland ecosystems."
