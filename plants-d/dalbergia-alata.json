    "intro": "Dalbergia alata, commonly known as the Indian rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces hard, dark wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
