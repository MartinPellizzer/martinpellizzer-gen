    "intro": "Dothilis, commonly known as the \"tongue of the forest,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Araceae. These plants are characterized by their unique inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Dothilis species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. They have fibrous roots and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking foliage."
