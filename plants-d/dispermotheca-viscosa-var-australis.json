    "intro": "Dispermotheca viscosa var. australis, commonly known as the sticky dispermotheca, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that aid in water retention and deter herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its fibrous roots system allows it to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. This species is often found in coastal and inland regions, contributing to local biodiversity."
