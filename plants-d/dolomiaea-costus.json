    "intro": "Dolomiaea costus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the mineral-rich substrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
