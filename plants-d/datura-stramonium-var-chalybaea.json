    "intro": "Datura stramonium var. chalybaea, commonly known as the white jimsonweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and its lobed, hairy leaves. The plant produces spiny capsules containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in fields, and in waste areas. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a noxious weed and can be harmful to both humans and animals."
