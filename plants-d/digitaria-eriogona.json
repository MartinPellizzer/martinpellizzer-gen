    "intro": "Digitaria eriogona, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and prairies. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
