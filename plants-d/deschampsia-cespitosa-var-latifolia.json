It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are broader than the typical variety. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, fluffy seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, open woodlands, and disturbed soils. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
