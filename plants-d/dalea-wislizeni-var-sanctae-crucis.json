    "intro": "Dalea wislizeni var. sanctae-crucis, commonly known as the Santa Cruz milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Its compound leaves are pinnately arranged, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
