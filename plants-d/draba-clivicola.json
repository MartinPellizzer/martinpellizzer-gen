    "intro": "Draba clivicola, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. Draba clivicola thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment."
