    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 fujipedis, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris japonica and Dryopteris affinis. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are responsible for the plant's reproductive cycle. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
