    "intro": "Diplazium ambiguum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a creeping rhizome with erect, lanceolate fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with pinnae that are narrowly ovate and often have a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's botanical structure supports its role as an ornamental and ecological component in its native habitats."
