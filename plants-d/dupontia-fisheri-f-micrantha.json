    "intro": "Dupontia fisheri f. micrantha, commonly known as the San Francisco dandelion, is a low-growing annual herb native to the coastal regions of California. It features basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dunes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
