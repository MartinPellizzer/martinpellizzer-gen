    "intro": "Diplazium brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged substrates. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water. Diplazium brevipes plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
