    "intro": "Diplodium pedoglossum, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the sandy coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Its flowers bloom during the spring and summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Diplodium pedoglossum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
