    "intro": "Dryopteris sancta var. balbisii, commonly known as the Balbisii wood fern, is a variant of the noble fern, characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It is native to the mountainous regions of Japan, where it thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with tightly curled, fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into a bipinnate structure. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a smooth, leathery texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with specific humidity and light conditions."
