    "intro": "Dryopteris parafuscipes, commonly known as the dark-furred wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that have a distinctive dark brown or black coloration on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant reproduces via spores, which are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia."
