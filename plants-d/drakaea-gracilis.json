    "intro": "Drakaea gracilis, commonly known as the slender spider-orchid, is an Australian native orchid species belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, intricate flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in heathland and woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Drakaea gracilis is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. It is listed as vulnerable in some regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
