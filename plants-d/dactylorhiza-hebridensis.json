    "intro": "Dactylorhiza hebridensis, commonly known as the Hebridean orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the British Isles. It is a herbaceous plant with a pseudobulbous structure, which stores water and nutrients. The plant produces a single stem with a few leaves and a spike of fragrant, violet-colored flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and woodland edges. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
