    "intro": "Deguelia polyantha, commonly known as the purple wisteria, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in pendulous clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are often woody and twining. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its propagation."
