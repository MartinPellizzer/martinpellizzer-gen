    "intro": "Dacrydium ericoides, commonly known as the silver pine or New Zealand silver pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that is typically silver-blue in color, giving it its common name. The tree has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 30 meters, forming a tall, slender trunk. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. The plant is well adapted to the cool, wet climate of its native habitat and plays an important role in New Zealand's native forests."
