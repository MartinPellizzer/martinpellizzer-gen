It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin, and its reproductive structures are borne on the underside of the leaves. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
