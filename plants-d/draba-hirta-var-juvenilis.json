    "intro": "Draba hirta var. juvenilis, commonly known as the dwarf whitlow grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. It is characterized by its compact size and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
