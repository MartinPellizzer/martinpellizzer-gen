    "intro": "Delphinium aquilegiifolium var. glandulosissimum, commonly known as the glandular-leaf larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a glandular surface, giving the plant its specific epithet. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. This variety is closely related to other larkspur species and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
