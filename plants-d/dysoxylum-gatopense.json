    "intro": "Dysoxylum gatopense, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The tree produces woody fruits that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its heartwood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
