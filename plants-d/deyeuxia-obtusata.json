    "intro": "Deyeuxia obtusata, commonly known as bluntleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, flat leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence is a panicle, composed of small spikelets that produce numerous tiny grains of pollen. Deyeuxia obtusata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
