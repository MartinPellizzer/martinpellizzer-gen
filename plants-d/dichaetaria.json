    "intro": "Dichaetaria, commonly known as the narrow-leaf grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often tufted growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The genus includes several species, many of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Dichaetaria species typically produce spikelets that are loosely arranged, with a single floret per spikelet. These plants are often found in wet or disturbed soils and are sometimes used in traditional medicine or as forage for livestock."
