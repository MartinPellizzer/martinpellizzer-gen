    "intro": "Dryopteris ireneae, commonly known as Irene's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
