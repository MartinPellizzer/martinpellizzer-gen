It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant has finely cut, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and showy blooms."
