    "intro": "Didiscus procumbens var. hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's didiscus, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to South America. It features small, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is a popular choice for ground cover in moist, shady environments."
