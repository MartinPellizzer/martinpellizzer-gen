    "intro": "Dendrobium nobile var. majus, commonly known as the Phalaenopsis orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without being parasitic. The plant produces long, pendant flower spikes that bear numerous showy, fragrant blooms in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. This variety is popular in horticulture for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
