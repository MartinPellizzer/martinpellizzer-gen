    "intro": "Diplycosia setosa, commonly known as the hairy diplycosia, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in moist environments. The species is often found in swampy areas and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils."
