    "intro": "Dryopteris odontophora, commonly known as the toothed wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive toothed or serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The botanical characteristics of Dryopteris odontophora make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
