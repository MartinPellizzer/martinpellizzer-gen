    "intro": "Digitaria platycarpha, commonly known as broad-leaf fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Digitaria platycarpha is typically low-growing and forms dense mats, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
