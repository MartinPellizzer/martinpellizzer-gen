    "intro": "Dryopteris blinii, commonly known as the Blin's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with intricate sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving in the understory of temperate deciduous forests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a distinctive and ornamental plant in horticulture."
