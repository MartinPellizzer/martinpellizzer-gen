    "intro": "Deparia liangshanensis var. liangshanensis, commonly known as the Liangshan spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
