    "intro": "Dianthera campestris, commonly known as the field dianthera, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in early summer. The plant has slender stems and oval, grass-like leaves, which help it thrive in open, disturbed habitats. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Dianthera campestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
