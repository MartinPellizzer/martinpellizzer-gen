    "intro": "Dodonaea pterocaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hop bush, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in spikes, which are followed by small, woody pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. Dodonaea pterocaulis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soils in erosion-prone areas."
