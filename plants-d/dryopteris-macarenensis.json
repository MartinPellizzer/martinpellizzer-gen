    "intro": "Dryopteris macarenensis, commonly known as the Macaronesian shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Macaronesian region, including parts of Portugal, Spain, and Morocco. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with distinctive, shield-like structures on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered in distinct, kidney-shaped groups on the fronds. Dryopteris macarenensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
