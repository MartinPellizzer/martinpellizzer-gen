    "intro": "Dryopteris villosula, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a rosette of fronds that emerge in spring. The hairy wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
