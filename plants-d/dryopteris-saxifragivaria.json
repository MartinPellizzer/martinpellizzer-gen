    "intro": "Dryopteris saxifragivaria, commonly known as the saxifrage fern, is a terrestrial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often found in mountainous or alpine environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are usually bipinnate and have a distinctive, somewhat curled appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters. The saxifrage fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained, acidic soil."
