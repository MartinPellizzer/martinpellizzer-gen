    "intro": "Dryadella crassicaudata, commonly known as the broad-tailed dryad, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
