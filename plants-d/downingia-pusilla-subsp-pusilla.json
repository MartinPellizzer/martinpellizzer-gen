    "intro": "Downingia pusilla subsp. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf downingia, is a small, flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in its cool, damp habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
