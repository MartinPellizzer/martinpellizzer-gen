    "intro": "Durio affinis, commonly known as the white durian, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its large, spiky fruit that is distinct from the more well-known durian species. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape. The tree thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its fruit, while less commercially significant than other durians, is valued for its unique aroma and flavor in local markets."
