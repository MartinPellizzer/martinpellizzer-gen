    "intro": "Dracaena longifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dracaena, is a tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and long, narrow, dark green leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Dracaena longifolia is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive with minimal care."
