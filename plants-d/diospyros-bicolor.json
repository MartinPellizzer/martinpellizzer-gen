    "intro": "Diospyros bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored ebony, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, glossy bark and leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by small, round fruits that mature to a reddish or purplish color. Its fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a hard, woody pulp. The tree is valued for its durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of timber."
