    "intro": "Dendrobium cariniferum, commonly known as the ridged orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant features a tall, cane-like stem with a series of fleshy, strap-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive ridge on the petals, which gives it its common name. Dendrobium cariniferum is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking blooms."
