    "intro": "Diplazium limbatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its floating fronds that are typically divided into broad, ovate segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for aquatic life. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
