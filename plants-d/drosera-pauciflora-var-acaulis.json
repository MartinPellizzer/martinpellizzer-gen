    "intro": "Drosera pauciflora var. acaulis, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of southern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and reduced leaves, which are adapted for trapping insects. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are covered in sticky glands that secrete a mucilaginous substance to ensnare prey. This variety is particularly notable for its compact growth habit and specialized adaptations to nutrient-poor environments."
