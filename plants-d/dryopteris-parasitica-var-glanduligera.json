    "intro": "Dryopteris parasitica var. glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular fern, is a variant of the parasitic fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into small, wedge-shaped segments. The plant has a unique ability to parasitize other ferns, drawing nutrients from its host through specialized roots. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This variant is notable for its distinctive glandular structures on the fronds, which contribute to its name."
