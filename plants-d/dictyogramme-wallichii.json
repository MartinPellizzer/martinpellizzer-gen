    "intro": "Dictyogramme wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan fern, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its leaves are pinnate and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, with a distinctive, lace-like appearance. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
