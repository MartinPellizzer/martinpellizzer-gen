    "intro": "Dictyanthus sepicola, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its small, linear leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds. Dictyanthus sepicola is an important plant for local pollinators and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
