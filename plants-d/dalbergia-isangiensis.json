    "intro": "Dalbergia isangiensis, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Eastern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has bipinnate leaves, and its flowers are small, clustered, and typically white or pale yellow. It produces pods containing flat, winged seeds, which aid in its dispersal. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
