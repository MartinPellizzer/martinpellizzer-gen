    "intro": "Delphinium tatsienense, commonly known as the Tibetan larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers are arranged in racemes, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its habitat, it is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
