    "intro": "Desmoncus horridus subsp. palustris, commonly known as the swamp bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it relies on its specialized adaptations to obtain nutrients. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its stems may be floating or emergent, depending on the water level. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in aquatic environments through its unique trapping mechanism."
