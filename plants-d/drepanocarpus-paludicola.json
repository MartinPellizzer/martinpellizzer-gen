It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red or pink. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its moist or swampy environment. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal.
