    "intro": "Diplazium remotum, commonly known as the remote fork fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that are often arching or creeping in growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
