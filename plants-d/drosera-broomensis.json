    "intro": "Drosera broomensis, commonly known as the Broome Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it thrives in saline and arid conditions. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in a dense inflorescence, often blooming during the cooler months. Drosera broomensis is a rare and specialized species, adapted to the unique ecological challenges of its coastal habitat."
