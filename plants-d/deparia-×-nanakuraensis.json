    "intro": "Deparia \u00d7 nanakuraensis, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Deparia japonica and Deparia nanakuraensis. It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family, characterized by its intricate fronds and spore-producing structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in high humidity. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year, and they exhibit a distinctive shield-shaped appearance. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
