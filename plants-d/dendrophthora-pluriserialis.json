    "intro": "Dendrophthora pluriserialis, commonly known as the multi-seeded tree fungus, is a unique species of parasitic plant that thrives by attaching itself to the roots of other trees. It belongs to the family Rafflesiaceae, known for its deceptive and often parasitic nature. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. Its flowers are large and showy, often attracting insects for pollination. Despite its parasitic lifestyle, Dendrophthora pluriserialis plays a niche role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree health and biodiversity."
