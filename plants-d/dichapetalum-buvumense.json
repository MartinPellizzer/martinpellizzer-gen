It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
