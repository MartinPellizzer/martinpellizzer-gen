It features tall, sparsely leafed stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
