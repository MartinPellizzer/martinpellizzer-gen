    "intro": "Dodecatheon meadia var. latilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed sand-verbena, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a red throat. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and rocky soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are erect and often branched. This variety is distinguished by its broader, more rounded flower lobes compared to the typical form of Dodecatheon meadia."
