    "intro": "Dichanthium intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a clump-forming growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its flowering period usually occurs during the warmer months, and it is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient environments. Dichanthium intermedium is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
