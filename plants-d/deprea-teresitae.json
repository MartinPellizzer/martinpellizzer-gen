    "intro": "Deprea teresitae, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
