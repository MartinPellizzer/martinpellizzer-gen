    "intro": "Danthonia papposa, commonly known as the downy danthonia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, slender blades that are often covered in a soft, whitish bloom, giving it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to purplish in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along stream banks. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is a valuable species for wetland restoration projects."
