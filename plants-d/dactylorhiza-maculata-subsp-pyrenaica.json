    "intro": "Dactylorhiza maculata subsp. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a terrestrial orchid with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and mountainous regions. It has a short, creeping rhizome and is adapted to the specific microclimatic conditions of its native range. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
