    "intro": "Dioscorea juxtlahuacensis, commonly known as the Huastec yam, is a species of yam native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a smooth texture, and it produces small, green flowers that develop into berries. The tubers are valued for their starchy content and have been traditionally used in indigenous communities for food and traditional medicine."
