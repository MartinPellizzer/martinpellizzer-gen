    "intro": "Diplacus fasciculatus, commonly known as the redstem false nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, especially when young. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy surface and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. The species is notable for its ability to hybridize with other Diplacus species, leading to variations in its floral characteristics."
