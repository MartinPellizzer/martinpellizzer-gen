    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 dufftii nothosubsp. stenkyrkae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and fens. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
