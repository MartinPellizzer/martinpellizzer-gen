    "intro": "Dactylis altaica, commonly known as Siberian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface, and it is adapted to thrive in well-drained, often sandy soils. Dactylis altaica is often found in open habitats such as steppes, meadows, and along roadsides in its native range."
