It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight. Its fibrous leaves have been historically used by indigenous peoples for various purposes, including making ropes and baskets."
