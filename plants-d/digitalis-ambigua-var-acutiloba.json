    "intro": "Digitalis ambigua var. acutiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf foxglove, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring tall, erect stems covered in dense, glandular hairs. The plant produces striking, hooded flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which are borne in racemes at the top of the stem.

This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is also noted for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic cardiac glycosides."
