    "intro": "Diplazium mildbraedii, commonly known as the slender sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae. Diplazium mildbraedii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
