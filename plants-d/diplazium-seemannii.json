    "intro": "Diplazium seemannii, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tree-like appearance with a thick, wiry rhizome and overlapping, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows epiphytically on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its fronds are divided into two types: sterile, which are broad and leathery, and fertile, which bear spore-producing structures. Diplazium seemannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
