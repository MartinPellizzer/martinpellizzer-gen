    "intro": "Dichanthium saccharoides subvar. torreyanum, commonly known as Torrey's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it an important plant for erosion control in its native range."
