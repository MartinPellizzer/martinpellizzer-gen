    "intro": "Dictyogramme wilfordii, commonly known as the Wilford's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pellaeaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
