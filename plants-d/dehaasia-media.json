    "intro": "Dehaasia media, commonly known as the narrow-leafed daisy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers with a central disc, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
