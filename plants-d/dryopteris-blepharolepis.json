    "intro": "Dryopteris blepharolepis, commonly known as the fringed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments with a fringed appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, retaining their color throughout the year, which contributes to its ornamental value in gardens."
