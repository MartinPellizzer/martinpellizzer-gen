    "intro": "Dalea laxiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Dalea laxiflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
