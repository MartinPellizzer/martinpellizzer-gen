    "intro": "Diplopappus diplostephioides, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a dry, two-part capsule that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs. The species is notable for its morphological similarities to dandelions, though it belongs to a different genus."
