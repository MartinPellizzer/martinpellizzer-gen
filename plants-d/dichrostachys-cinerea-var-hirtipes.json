It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically pubescent. The plant produces fluffy, pale yellow to white inflorescences that resemble sickles, which are highly visible during the flowering season. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, making it an important component of local ecosystems. This variety is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
