    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. subspiciformis, commonly known as the spikeless field grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often less prominent than those of the typical variety. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and pastures. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and use in erosion control."
