    "intro": "Dactylorhiza romana subsp. georgica, commonly known as the Georgian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces a single, elongated spike bearing several pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
