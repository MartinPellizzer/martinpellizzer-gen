    "intro": "Dryopteris raiateensis, commonly known as the Raiatea fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The fronds are dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, almost metallic sheen. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found growing in coastal areas and on rocky outcrops. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
