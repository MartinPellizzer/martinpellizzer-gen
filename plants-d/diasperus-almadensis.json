It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in dry, hot environments. Its leaves are usually small and may be covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Diasperus almadensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
