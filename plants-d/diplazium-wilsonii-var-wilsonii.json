    "intro": "Diplazium wilsonii var. wilsonii, commonly known as the Wilson's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a robust rhizome system that supports its growth in shaded, moist environments. The plant has lanceolate, leathery leaves with a distinctive, glossy surface and serrated margins. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique, clustered pattern on the underside of the fronds. This variant is notable for its adaptability and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
