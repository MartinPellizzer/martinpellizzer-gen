    "intro": "Deschampsia monandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and stream banks. It is often found in association with other grasses and forbs in ecologically diverse environments. Deschampsia monandra plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
