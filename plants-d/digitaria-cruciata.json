    "intro": "Digitaria cruciata, commonly known as the crossleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the grass family. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable environments. Digitaria cruciata plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
