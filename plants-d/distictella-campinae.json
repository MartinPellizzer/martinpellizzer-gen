    "intro": "Distictella campinae, commonly known as the Cape daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland habitats. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it prefers full sun and well-drained conditions."
