    "intro": "Digitaria arenaria, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to sandy and coastal regions of the United States. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as dunes, roadsides, and sandy soils. The plant has fine, wiry leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pale green or bluish in color. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive drought conditions. Its growth habit makes it an important component of coastal and sandy ecosystems."
