    "intro": "Daphne angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Daphne angustissima is also valued for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
