    "intro": "Dioscorea sterilis, commonly known as the wild yam, is a flowering plant native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a member of the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and develops tuberous roots, which are often harvested for their medicinal and nutritional properties. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are usually hairy. Dioscorea sterilis is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits, though it is not as widely cultivated as other yam species."
