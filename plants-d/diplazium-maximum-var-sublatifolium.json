    "intro": "Diplazium maximum var. sublatifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved chain fern, is a variant of the chain fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, creeping underground stem that supports its upright fronds. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
