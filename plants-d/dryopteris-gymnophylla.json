    "intro": "Dryopteris gymnophylla, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance, contributing to its common name."
