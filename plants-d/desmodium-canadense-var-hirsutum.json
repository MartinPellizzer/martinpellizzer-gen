It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its seed pods are slender and curved, containing several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Hairy ticktrefoil is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in open woodlands."
