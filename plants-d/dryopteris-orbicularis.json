    "intro": "Dryopteris orbicularis, commonly known as the Japanese Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, orbicular-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread gradually. The fronds are usually dark green and remain intact through the winter, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
