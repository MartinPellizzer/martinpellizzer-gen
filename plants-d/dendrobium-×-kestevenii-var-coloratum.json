    "intro": "Dendrobium \u00d7 kestevenii var. coloratum, commonly known as the colorata orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several feet in length, with clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. Its flowers are usually borne on the stems and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant requires bright, indirect light and consistent humidity to thrive, making it suitable for indoor cultivation in warm climates."
