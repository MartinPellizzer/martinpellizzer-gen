    "intro": "Draba daurica var. ramosa, commonly known as Daurian mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It features small, basal rosettes of silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
