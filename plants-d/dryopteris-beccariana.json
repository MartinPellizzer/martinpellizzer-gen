    "intro": "Dryopteris beccariana, commonly known as the Beccari's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, slender fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing soruses that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in temperate climates."
