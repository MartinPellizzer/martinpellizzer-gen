    "intro": "Dichapetalum mombongense var. breviflorum, commonly known as the Mombong bush, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its unique, often clustered inflorescences. The plant typically features elongated, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
