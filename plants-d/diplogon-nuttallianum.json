    "intro": "Diplogon nuttallianum, commonly known as the Nuttall's diplogon, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, pentamerous flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant often grows in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
