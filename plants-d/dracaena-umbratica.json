    "intro": "Dracaena umbratica, commonly known as the shadow dracaena, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, glossy leaves that give it its common name. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 feet in optimal conditions. Its foliage is often used in interior landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities. Dracaena umbratica thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to maintain its health."
