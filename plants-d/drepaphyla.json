    "intro": "Drepaphyla, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that often appear translucent or semi-transparent, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Drepaphyla species are native to regions in South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Peru. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
