    "intro": "Dianthus caryophyllus f. brevifolius, commonly known as the dwarf carnation, is a compact, low-growing variant of the common carnation. It features dense clusters of showy, double-petaled flowers in a range of colors, including red, pink, and white. The foliage is characterized by its short, broad leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating. This cultivar is prized for its compact growth habit and extended blooming period, making it suitable for rock gardens, borders, and container planting. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal maintenance once established."
