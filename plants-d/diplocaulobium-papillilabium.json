    "intro": "Diplocaulobium papillilabium, commonly known as the papillilabium duckweed, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Araliaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne in clusters above the water. Its leaves are covered with tiny papillae, which give it its scientific name. This species is often found in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes."
