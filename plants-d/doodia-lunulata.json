    "intro": "Doodia lunulata, commonly known as the moon's edge fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that feature a distinctive white or pale margin, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while also storing nutrients. Doodia lunulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, tropical conditions."
