    "intro": "Dianella revoluta, commonly known as the coastal flax lily, is a perennial evergreen plant native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in umbels at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Dianella revoluta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate salt spray, enhancing its suitability for coastal environments."
