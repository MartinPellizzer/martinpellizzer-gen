    "intro": "Dryopteris inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are often divided into segments of varying sizes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
