    "intro": "Dichanthelium cynodon, commonly known as Florida panicum, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy blades that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, and is adapted to tolerate seasonal flooding. Botanically, it is distinguished by its two distinct types of flowering structures, which contribute to its classification within the grass family."
