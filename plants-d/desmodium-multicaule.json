    "intro": "Desmodium multicaule, commonly known as hairy burr medic, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in forage and soil improvement."
