    "intro": "Dubautia \u00d7 paludicola, commonly known as the wetland dubautia, is a hybrid plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, clustered inflorescences that produce small, pink to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet forests. It has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its natural habitat. Dubautia \u00d7 paludicola is adapted to the humid climate and nutrient-poor soils of Hawaii's coastal and lowland areas."
