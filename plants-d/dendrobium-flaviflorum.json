    "intro": "Dendrobium flaviflorum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers during the rainy season, typically in summer. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Dendrobium flaviflorum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
