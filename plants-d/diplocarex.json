    "intro": "Diplocarex, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing growth habit, often forming dense cushions or mats. The plants typically have small, rounded leaves and produce umbellate inflorescences with small white or yellow flowers. Diplocarex species are often found in alpine or arctic regions, thriving in cold, rocky environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates."
