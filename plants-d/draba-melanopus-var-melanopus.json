    "intro": "Draba melanopus var. melanopus, commonly known as the blackfooted winter flowering cabbage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and features a dense rosette of basal leaves that are dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a single umbel at the top of the stem. Its leaves are leathery and have a slightly woolly texture, adapting to the harsh, alpine environments it inhabits. Draba melanopus var. melanopus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with a short growing season."
