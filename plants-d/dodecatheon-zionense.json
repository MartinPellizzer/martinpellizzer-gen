    "intro": "Dodecatheon zionense, commonly known as the Zion shootingstar, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in the Zion National Park area. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and open slopes, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
