    "intro": "Delphinium menziesii var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in clusters at the tips of the stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with lance-shaped leaflets that are arranged alternately along the stem. This variety is distinguished by its reduced number of flowers compared to other delphinium species, contributing to its unique appearance."
