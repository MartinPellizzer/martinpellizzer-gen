    "intro": "Dalbergia hostilis, commonly known as the African bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark brown to black heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by flat, bean-like pods. It thrives in dry, savannah-like conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The tree is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
