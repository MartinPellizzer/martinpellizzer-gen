    "intro": "Dendrobium goilalae, commonly known as the Goilala orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the highlands of Papua New Guinea. It is characterized by its tall, clustered growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered."
