    "intro": "Dorcoceras hygrometrica, commonly known as the hygrometric horned snail, is a species of air-breathing land snail. It belongs to the family Hygromiidae and is characterized by its spiral shell that is typically light-colored with a smooth surface. The snail is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and gardens. Its name derives from its ability to detect changes in humidity, which influences its behavior and activity patterns. This species plays a role in nutrient cycling by feeding on decaying plant matter and algae."
