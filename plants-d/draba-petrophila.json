    "intro": "Draba petrophila, commonly known as the rock draba, is a small, flowering plant native to high-altitude environments in the Rocky Mountains. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers and low-growing habit. The plant thrives in rocky soils and harsh climates, often found in alpine tundra and talus slopes. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round seed pods that release seeds by spring. Draba petrophila is adapted to cold temperatures and has a short growing season, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
