    "intro": "Dioscorea meridensis, commonly known as the southern yam, is a perennial herbaceous vine native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and tuberous roots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its tubers, which are the main part of interest, are edible when properly prepared and have been used traditionally in various cuisines. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
