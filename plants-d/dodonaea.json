    "intro": "Dodonaea, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapindaceae. These plants are characterized by their finely textured, often silver or grayish foliage, which gives them a distinctive appearance. Dodonaea species are typically shrubs or small trees, native to various regions of Australia, South America, and parts of Africa. They produce small, clustered flowers that are often yellow or red, followed by woody, bead-like fruits. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its drought tolerance and unique foliage."
