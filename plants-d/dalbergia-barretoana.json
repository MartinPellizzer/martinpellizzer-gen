    "intro": "Dalbergia barretoana, commonly known as the yellow rosewood, is a species of legume native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters, with bipinnate leaves and small, fragrant flowers. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
