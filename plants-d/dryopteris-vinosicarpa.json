    "intro": "Dryopteris vinosicarpa, commonly known as the purple-fruited wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, deeply divided fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, purple spore-bearing structures called sorocarps, which are clustered along the stalks of the fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The species is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
