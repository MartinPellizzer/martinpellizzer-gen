It is characterized by its silvery-gray, aromatic leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and seasonal flowering."
