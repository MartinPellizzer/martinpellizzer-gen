These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. Dornera species are herbaceous perennials that typically feature tuberous roots and striking, showy flowers. The leaves are usually alternate and have a waxy texture, while the inflorescences are often clustered in umbels. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated as houseplants."
