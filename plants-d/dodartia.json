    "intro": "Dodartia, commonly known as the white violets, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Violaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that typically feature white or pale purple petals. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe, Asia, and North America. Dodartia species often grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, adding to the plant's ornamental appeal."
