    "intro": "Diplazium ochraceum, commonly known as the yellow hedyotis, is a perennial fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. The plant has a creeping rhizome that helps it spread and establish new colonies."
