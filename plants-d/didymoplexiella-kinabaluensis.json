    "intro": "Didymoplexiella kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu mistflower, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the montane regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, small flowers and trailing growth habit. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, typically at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, while its flowers are white or pale pink with four petals. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
