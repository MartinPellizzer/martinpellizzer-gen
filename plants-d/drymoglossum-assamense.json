    "intro": "Drymoglossum assamense, commonly known as the Assam haircap, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a dark green to reddish-brown color, with closely appressed leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. It plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat. Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the regions of Assam and neighboring areas."
