    "intro": "Dyckia kuntzeana, commonly known as the Kuntze's dyckia, is a species of flowering plant in the bromeliad family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its dense, evergreen rosette of stiff, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Dyckia kuntzeana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
