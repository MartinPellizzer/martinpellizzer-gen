    "intro": "Dendrobium huoshanense, commonly known as the Huoshan orchid, is a species of orchid native to China. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often arranged in clusters. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with periods of drought. Dendrobium huoshanense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
