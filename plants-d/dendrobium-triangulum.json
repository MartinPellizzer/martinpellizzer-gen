    "intro": "Dendrobium triangulum, commonly known as the triangle orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a distinctive triangular shape in its pseudobulbs, which are thickened stems that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically yellow or green with red or purple markings, and they bloom during the dry season. Dendrobium triangulum is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
