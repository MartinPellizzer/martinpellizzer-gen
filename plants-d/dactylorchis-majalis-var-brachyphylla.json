    "intro": "Dactylorchis majalis var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and pale green to brownish-green leaves that are shorter than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
