    "intro": "Dendrocereus undulosus, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a columnar cactus with distinctive, undulating ribs that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the night, which are pollinated by bats and other nocturnal insects. Its stems are covered in spines and can store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
