    "intro": "Dracocephalum nuristanicum, commonly known as the Nuristan bluehead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Pakistan and Afghanistan. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
