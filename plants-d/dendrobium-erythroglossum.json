    "intro": "Dendrobium erythroglossum, commonly known as the red-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. Its most striking characteristic is its showy, fragrant flowers, which are typically pink or red with a distinctive red lip. Dendrobium erythroglossum thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
