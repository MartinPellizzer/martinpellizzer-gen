    "intro": "Diapensia cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf diapensia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, dark green, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. Diapensia cuneifolia produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during late spring to early summer. It is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
