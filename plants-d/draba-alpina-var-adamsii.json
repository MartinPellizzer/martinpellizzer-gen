    "intro": "Draba alpina var. adamsii, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowers are often surrounded by a distinctive, bell-shaped structure, giving it its common name. Draba alpina var. adamsii is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where few other plants can survive."
