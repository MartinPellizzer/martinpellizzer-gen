    "intro": "Dendrobium roseonervatum, commonly known as the rose-veined orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems that grow horizontally and produce new shoots from the base. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, often with a distinctive rose-like veining pattern on the petals. It thrives in warm, humid climates with bright indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium roseonervatum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
