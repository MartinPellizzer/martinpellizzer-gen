It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped pinnae with short, sessile lobes, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
