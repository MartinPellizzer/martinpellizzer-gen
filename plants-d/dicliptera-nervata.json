    "intro": "Dicliptera nervata, commonly known as the veined grass or slender panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a paniculate cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers. Dicliptera nervata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
