    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa, commonly known as hair grass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray blades that are often covered in soft hairs. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, meadows, and stream banks. Deschampsia cespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
