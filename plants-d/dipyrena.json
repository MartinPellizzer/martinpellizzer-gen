It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and along roadsides. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Dipyrena is often mistaken for the true dandelion due to its similar appearance."
