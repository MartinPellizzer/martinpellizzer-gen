    "intro": "Dupatya dendroides, commonly known as the golden tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique ability to store water in its trunk, which helps it survive in dry conditions. Its fronds are typically bright green, with a slightly golden hue on the underside. Dupatya dendroides is often found in humid, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests."
