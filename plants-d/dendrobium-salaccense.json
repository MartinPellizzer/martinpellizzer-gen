    "intro": "Dendrobium salaccense, commonly known as the Borneo orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique growth habit, with a branched stem that can reach up to 1 meter in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive red or orange lip, and they bloom in clusters. Dendrobium salaccense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
