    "intro": "Davallia subimbricata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that resemble a shield, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form compact clumps, while the fronds are leathery and dark green. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
