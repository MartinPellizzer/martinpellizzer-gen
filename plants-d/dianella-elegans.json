    "intro": "Dianella elegans, commonly known as the slender flax lily, is a perennial evergreen plant native to eastern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, compact rosette, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in spring, which are borne on slender, erect spikes. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Dianella elegans is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
