    "intro": "Drynaria subfalcata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Drynaria subfalcata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also valued in traditional medicine."
