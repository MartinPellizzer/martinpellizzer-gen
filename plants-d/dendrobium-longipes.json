    "intro": "Dendrobium longipes, commonly known as the longiped orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Dendrobium longipes is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
