It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its leaves are usually hairy and have distinct venation patterns, which give it its subspecies name \"nervosa.\" This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
