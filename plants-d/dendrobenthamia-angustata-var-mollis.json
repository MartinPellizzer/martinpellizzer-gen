    "intro": "Dendrobenthamia angustata var. mollis, commonly known as the narrowleaf dendrobenthamia, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically arranged in clusters along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
