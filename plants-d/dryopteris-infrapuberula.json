    "intro": "Dryopteris infrapuberula, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are covered with fine, hairy scales, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, textured foliage."
