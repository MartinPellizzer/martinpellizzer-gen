    "intro": "Dendrobium boothii, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are typically strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. Dendrobium boothii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
