    "intro": "Discolobium pulchellum var. viscosissimum, commonly known as the sticky discolobium, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody growth and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its sticky foliage helps reduce water loss, making it well adapted to dry environments. The varietal form viscosissimum is distinguished by its particularly viscous resinous secretions."
