    "intro": "Diplusodon incanus var. serpyllum, commonly known as the slender hairvetch, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in partial shade, making it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules makes it ecologically significant in soil fertility."
