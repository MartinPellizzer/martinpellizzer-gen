    "intro": "Dendrobium atavus, commonly known as the old man's beard, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, wiry stems that can reach several meters in length, often hanging in cascading clusters. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with red or brown markings, and they bloom in clusters along the stems. Dendrobium atavus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience."
