    "intro": "Draba patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Draba patagonica produces small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
