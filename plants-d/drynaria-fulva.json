    "intro": "Drynaria fulva, commonly known as the golden tree fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a climbing fern that forms dense, tree-like structures with a central trunk and a crown of fronds. The plant has a unique rhizome system that allows it to anchor itself to trees and other vertical surfaces. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a bright yellow to orange hue on the underside, giving it its common name. Drynaria fulva is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
