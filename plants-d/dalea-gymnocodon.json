    "intro": "Dalea gymnocodon, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of several narrow leaflets. Dalea gymnocodon plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
