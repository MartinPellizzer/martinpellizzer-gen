    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa f. reptans, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a soft, silky texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as meadows and roadsides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient and persistent species in its native habitat."
