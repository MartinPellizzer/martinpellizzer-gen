    "intro": "Dryopteris zollingeriana, commonly known as the Zollinger's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features a compact, upright growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces fertile spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
