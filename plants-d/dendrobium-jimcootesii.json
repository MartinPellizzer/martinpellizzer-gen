    "intro": "Dendrobium jimcootesii, commonly known as the Jimcoote's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly colorful, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
