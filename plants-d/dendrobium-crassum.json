    "intro": "Dendrobium crassum, commonly known as the thick-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with fleshy, often thickened pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are usually broad and leathery, adapting to its humid, tropical environment. Dendrobium crassum is appreciated in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
