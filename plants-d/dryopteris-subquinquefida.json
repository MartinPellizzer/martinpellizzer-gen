    "intro": "Dryopteris subquinquefida, commonly known as the five-finger fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into five pairs of pinnae, giving it the appearance of fingers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night. This unique trait makes it a rare and fascinating subject in botanical studies."
