It features basal leaves that are hairy and often covered in a dense white or gray pubescence, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a sought-after plant for rock gardens and alpine collections."
