    "intro": "Dryopteris stanley-walkeri, commonly known as Stanley's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant features a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in shaded, moist woodland environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
