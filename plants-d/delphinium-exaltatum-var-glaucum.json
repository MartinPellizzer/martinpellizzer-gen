    "intro": "Delphinium exaltatum var. glaucum, commonly known as the blue larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces clusters of striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery blue-gray coating, which gives it a distinctive appearance. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is also found in wildflower meadows."
