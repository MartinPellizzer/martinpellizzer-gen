    "intro": "Dianella sparsiflora var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain dianella, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to New Zealand. It features narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
