    "intro": "Delphinium sonnei, commonly known as Sonne's larkspur, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense spikes at the top of the stem. Delphinium sonnei is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves and its ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. However, it is toxic to livestock due to the presence of alkaloids, requiring caution in cultivation."
