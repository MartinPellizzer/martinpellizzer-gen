    "intro": "Dolicholus lewtonii, commonly known as the Lewton's dolicholus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth, where it relies on specific soil conditions for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are elliptical with a glossy surface, and it produces fragrant, white to pale yellow blooms during the rainy season. Due to habitat loss, Dolicholus lewtonii is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and conservation."
