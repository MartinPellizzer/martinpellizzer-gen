    "intro": "Dichanthelium acuminatum var. villosum, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often have a reddish tinge. The leaves are narrow and hairy, with a prominent midrib, and the inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-awned spikelets. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is often found in native plant restoration projects."
