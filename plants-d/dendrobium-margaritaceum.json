    "intro": "Dendrobium margaritaceum, commonly known as the pearl orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often resembling pearls, which gives it its common name. Its stems are typically slender and can be either erect or hanging, depending on the growing conditions. Dendrobium margaritaceum thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light."
