    "intro": "Dryopteris squamosissima var. bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of pale, scaly indumentum. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in mountainous areas with high humidity. Its fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture and a dark green coloration. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
