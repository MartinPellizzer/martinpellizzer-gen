It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence that bears small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often found in colonies, forming dense vegetation. Dichaetanthera corymbosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
