    "intro": "Desmodium subsericeum, commonly known as narrowleaf burrlegume, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces distinctive burrs that contain hooked spines, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Desmodium subsericeum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
