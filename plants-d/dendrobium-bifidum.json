    "intro": "Dendrobium bifidum, commonly known as the bifid orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, lance-shaped leaves and blooms with fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that have distinctive bifid (split) petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium bifidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
