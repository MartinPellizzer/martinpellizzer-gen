    "intro": "Drosera meristocaulis, commonly known as the misty sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, sticky leaves that trap insects. The plant's stems are short and often covered in fine, glandular hairs that secrete digestive enzymes. It thrives in wet, acidic environments and is often found in swamps or heathlands. Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
