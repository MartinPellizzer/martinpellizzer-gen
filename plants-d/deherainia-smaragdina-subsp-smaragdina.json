    "intro": "Deherainia smaragdina subsp. smaragdina, commonly known as the emerald green orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant green foliage and strikingly colorful flowers that range from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to trees without deriving nutrients from them. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
