    "intro": "Davallia longula, commonly known as the long-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive, elongated shape, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, with a silvery underside that reflects light, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Davallia longula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, indoor conditions."
