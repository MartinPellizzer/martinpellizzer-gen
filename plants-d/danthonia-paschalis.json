    "intro": "Danthonia paschalis, commonly known as the Paschal grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly folded, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more prominent during the growing season. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. This grass is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas."
