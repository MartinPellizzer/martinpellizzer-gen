    "intro": "Dryopteris repanda, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a deciduous fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, slender, cinnamon-colored fertile fronds that contrast with its broader, dark green sterile fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-rich soil. The cinnamon fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its distinctive appearance."
