    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 apuana, commonly known as the Apuan fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis. It is a robust, evergreen fern characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
