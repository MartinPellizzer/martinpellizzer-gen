    "intro": "Deschampsia minor, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant features fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in wetland ecosystems. Deschampsia minor is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
