    "intro": "Diteilis wrayi, commonly known as the slender glassworts, is a species of flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa and Namibia. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Diteilis wrayi is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates high salinity and strong coastal winds."
