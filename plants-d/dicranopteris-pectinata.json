    "intro": "Dicranopteris pectinata, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the surface of water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Dicranopteris pectinata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
