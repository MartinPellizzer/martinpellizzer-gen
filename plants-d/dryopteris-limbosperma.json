    "intro": "Dryopteris limbosperma, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance on the underside of the leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
