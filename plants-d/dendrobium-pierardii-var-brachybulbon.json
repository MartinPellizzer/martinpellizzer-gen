    "intro": "Dendrobium pierardii var. brachybulbon, commonly known as the short-stemmed Dendrobium, is a sympodial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with short, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to white flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in two rows along the pseudobulbs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
