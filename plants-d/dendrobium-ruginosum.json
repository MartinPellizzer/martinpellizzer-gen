    "intro": "Dendrobium ruginosum, commonly known as the woolly orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome that produces a cluster of fleshy, hairy pseudobulbs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, often with a reddish or purple hue at the base. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Dendrobium ruginosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
