    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 braunii, commonly known as the broad-leaf marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in late summer. Dactylorhiza \u00d7 braunii is a perennial herb that plays an important role in its ecosystem by supporting pollinators and contributing to soil stability."
