    "intro": "Dolichos incurvus, commonly known as the bent-stem dolichos, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often curved stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It is valued for its edible seeds, which are rich in protein and used in various traditional cuisines. Additionally, it plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its association with Rhizobium bacteria."
