    "intro": "Dasistoma quercifolia var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate oakleaf dasistoma, is a variant of the dasistoma genus native to specific regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that resemble those of oak trees, with a broad, ovate shape and serrated edges. The plant typically grows in tropical or subtropical environments, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in greenish-yellow clusters, and it produces small, edible fruits that are consumed by various wildlife species. The variant intermedia is distinguished by slight differences in leaf morphology and habitat preference compared to other dasistoma species."
