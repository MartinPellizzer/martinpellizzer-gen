    "intro": "Desmanthus depressus, commonly known as the flatleaf desmanthus, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in spikes. The plant is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grassy areas. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Desmanthus depressus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
