    "intro": "Dendrobium lawesii, commonly known as the Wollaston's orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces strikingly colorful, showy flowers that are typically white or pink with yellow or red markings. Its stems are typically clustered and can be quite long, often reaching several feet in length. Dendrobium lawesii thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
