It typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. Dichelachne forsteriana is often found in disturbed or poorly drained soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
