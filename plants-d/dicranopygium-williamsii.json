It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like appearance, with slender, branching stems covered in small, overlapping leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on specialized stalks and release spores for dispersal.
