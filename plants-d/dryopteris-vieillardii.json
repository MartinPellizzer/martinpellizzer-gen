    "intro": "Dryopteris vieillardii, commonly known as the Vieillard's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and new fronds, allowing it to spread gradually within its habitat. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
