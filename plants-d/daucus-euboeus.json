    "intro": "Daucus euboeus, commonly known as the Euboean carrot, is a flowering plant native to the Greek island of Euboea. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in umbels. Its roots are typically small and not as commercially valuable as those of the common carrot. Daucus euboeus is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is considered a wild relative of cultivated carrots."
