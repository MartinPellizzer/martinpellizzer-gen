    "intro": "Dryopteris connexa, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
