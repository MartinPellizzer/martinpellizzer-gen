    "intro": "Deutzia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessileleaf deutzia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, oval-shaped leaves that are usually sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive floral display. Deutzia sessilifolia is relatively low maintenance and suitable for USDA hardiness zones 4 through 8."
