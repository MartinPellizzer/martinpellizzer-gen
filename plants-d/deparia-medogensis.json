    "intro": "Deparia medogensis, commonly known as the Tibetan water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in mountain lakes and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Deparia medogensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
