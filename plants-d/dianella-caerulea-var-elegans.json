    "intro": "Dianella caerulea var. elegans, commonly known as the blue-flowered lily or slender flax lily, is a striking ornamental plant native to New Zealand. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette, and it produces striking blue to violet flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant is evergreen, with a compact growth habit that makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract native pollinators."
