    "intro": "Delphinium amani, commonly known as the Amani larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive blue-green hue, and its flowers are showy, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Delphinium amani is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
