    "intro": "Drosera orbiculata, commonly known as the round-leaved sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects. The leaves are orbicular, meaning they are rounded in shape, and covered in bright red or reddish hairs that secrete a viscous, sticky substance. This plant thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It is a hardy species that can survive in harsh conditions, making it a popular choice for carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
