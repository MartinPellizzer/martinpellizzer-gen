    "intro": "Dactylorhiza euxina var. markowitschii, commonly known as the Markowitsch's marsh orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant prefers wet, nutrient-poor habitats such as bogs and marshes, where it forms dense colonies. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the acidic, waterlogged soil. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety faces significant conservation challenges."
