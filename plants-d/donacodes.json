    "intro": "Donacodes, commonly known as the giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It has long, slender, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 4 meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a fibrous texture. Donacodes plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
