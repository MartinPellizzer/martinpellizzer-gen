    "intro": "Dendrobium anthrene, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a tall, upright growth habit with a branched stem system that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in two rows along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Dendrobium anthrene thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
