    "intro": "Dasistoma tubulosa, commonly known as the tubular dasistoma, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its striking, tubular-shaped flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Dasistoma tubulosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
