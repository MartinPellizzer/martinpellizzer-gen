    "intro": "Dryopteris stubelii, commonly known as the Stubel's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil. Dryopteris stubelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
