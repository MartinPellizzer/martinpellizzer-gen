    "intro": "Duranta repens var. variegata, commonly known as the Variegated Necklace Plant, is a vigorous trailing shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a yellow throat. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a glossy green surface and prominent white or yellow variegation patterns. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is commonly used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its fast growth and ornamental appeal. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract hummingbirds and other pollinators."
