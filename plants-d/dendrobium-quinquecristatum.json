    "intro": "Dendrobium quinquecristatum, commonly known as the five-ridge orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a branched stem system with multiple vertical pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive, intricate pattern of markings. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
