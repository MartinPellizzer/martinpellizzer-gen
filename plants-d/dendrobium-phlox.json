It features tall, erect stems that are often covered in dense clusters of bright orange or red flowers. The plant has a complex structure with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are showy and long-lasting, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright but indirect light."
