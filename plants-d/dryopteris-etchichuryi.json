    "intro": "Dryopteris etchichuryi, commonly known as the Etchichury fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the mountainous regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green and have a finely divided, feather-like structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic and ecological significance."
