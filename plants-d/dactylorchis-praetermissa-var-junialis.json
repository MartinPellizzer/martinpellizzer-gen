    "intro": "Dactylorchis praetermissa var. junialis, commonly known as the small-flowered marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It features a slender, leafless stem that bears a single spike of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in damp, calcareous soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are characterized by their narrow, elongated petals and sepals, with a distinctive lip that is hooded and notched. This orchid is a rare and protected species, often requiring specific environmental conditions to thrive."
