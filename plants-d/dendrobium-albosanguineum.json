    "intro": "Dendrobium albosanguineum, commonly known as the white blood orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking white flowers with a pinkish tinge, which bloom during the rainy season. It has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in humid, tropical environments. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural and conservation studies."
