    "intro": "Dendrobium maliliense, commonly known as the Malili orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Dendrobium maliliense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
