    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sambucina f. zimmermannii, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and is often found in peatlands or along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a rosette, while its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
