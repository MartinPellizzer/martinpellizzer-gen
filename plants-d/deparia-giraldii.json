    "intro": "Deparia giraldii, commonly known as the Giraldi's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are usually short and horizontal, supporting the growth of its intricate foliage. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
