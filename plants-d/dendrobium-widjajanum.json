    "intro": "Dendrobium widjajanum, commonly known as the Widjaja's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for climbing on trees or rocks. Dendrobium widjajanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
