    "intro": "Dissanthelium minimum, commonly known as the small-flowered panicgrass, is a grass species native to North America. It is a low-growing, perennial plant that typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research."
