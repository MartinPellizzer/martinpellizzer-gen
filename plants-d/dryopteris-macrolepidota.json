    "intro": "Dryopteris macrolepidota, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, robust fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features a thick, wiry rhizome and large, compound leaves with a distinctive shield-shaped outline. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This fern is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
