    "intro": "Daphne thymelaea, commonly known as winter daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has dark green, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its stems are typically covered in a waxy, white coating, which helps protect it from cold temperatures. Daphne thymelaea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
