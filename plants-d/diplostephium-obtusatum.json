    "intro": "Diplostephium obtusatum, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive sap and unique floral structures. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are broad and opposite, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts."
