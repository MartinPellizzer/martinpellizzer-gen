    "intro": "Draba decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate whitlow grass, is a low-growing flowering plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It typically forms dense mats close to the ground, with small, basal leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. It is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. Draba decumbens plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in mountainous and tundra regions."
