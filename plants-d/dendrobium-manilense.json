    "intro": "Dendrobium manilense, commonly known as the Manila orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, which bloom during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought. Dendrobium manilense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
