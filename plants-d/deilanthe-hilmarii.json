    "intro": "Deilanthe hilmarii, commonly known as the Halmari fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often near stream beds or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually clustered at the base, with a short, creeping rhizome that helps anchor it to the substrate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Deilanthe hilmarii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
