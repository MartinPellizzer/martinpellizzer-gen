    "intro": "Draba dedeana, commonly known as the Dedean's rockcress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. It produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, rounded pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
