    "intro": "Dalbergia florifera, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it its common name. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The wood of Dalbergia florifera is valued for its density and fine grain, though it is less commonly used commercially compared to other Dalbergia species."
