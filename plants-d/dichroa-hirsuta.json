    "intro": "Dichroa hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy dichroa, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that are hairy on both surfaces, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. Dichroa hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for shaded garden environments."
