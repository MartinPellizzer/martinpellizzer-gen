    "intro": "Draba megasperma var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smoothleaf whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, and the plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
