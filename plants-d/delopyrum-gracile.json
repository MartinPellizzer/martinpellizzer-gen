    "intro": "Delopyrum gracile, commonly known as the slender spikegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often less than 10 centimeters in height, with fine, thread-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soils. Delopyrum gracile plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
