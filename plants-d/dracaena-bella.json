    "intro": "Dracaena bella, commonly known as the laceleaf dracaena, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow streaks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Dracaena bella thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is popular as a houseplant due to its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
