    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 sugino-takaoi, commonly known as the Takaoi shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris affinis and Dryopteris takaoensis. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply divided fronds that often display a rich green color with a slight purplish tinge on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, and it reproduces sexually through spore dispersal. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
