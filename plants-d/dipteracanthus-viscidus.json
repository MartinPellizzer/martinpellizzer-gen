    "intro": "Dipteracanthus viscidus, commonly known as the sticky dipteracanthus, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which is a notable botanical feature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The sticky secretions may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores or aid in pollination."
