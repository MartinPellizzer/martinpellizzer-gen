    "intro": "Davallia decomposita, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden-colored coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often segmented and can form dense colonies. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds."
