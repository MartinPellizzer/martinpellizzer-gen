It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to bright light. Due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
