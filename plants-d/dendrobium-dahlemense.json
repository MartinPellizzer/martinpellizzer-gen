    "intro": "Dendrobium dahlemense, commonly known as the Dahlem orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, which is an adaptation to its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinct, often fragrant scent. Dendrobium dahlemense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions."
