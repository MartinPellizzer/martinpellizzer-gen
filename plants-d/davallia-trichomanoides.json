    "intro": "Davallia trichomanoides, commonly known as the hairy Davallia, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a unique texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced in small, clusters of sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
