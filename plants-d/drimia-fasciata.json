    "intro": "Drimia fasciata, commonly known as the zebra lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive striped leaves, which are narrow and have a pale midrib running along their length. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Drimia fasciata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
