    "intro": "Discocnide, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its hollow, hair-like structures called trichomes that release irritating chemicals when touched. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found throughout temperate regions. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Discocnide is both a weed and a valuable plant used in traditional medicine and as a food source when cooked."
