    "intro": "Dactylorhiza armeniaca, commonly known as the Armenian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caucasus region. It is a perennial herb with a slender, hairy stem and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing numerous small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
