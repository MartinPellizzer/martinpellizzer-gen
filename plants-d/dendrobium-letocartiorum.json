It features a sympodial growth habit with a tall, branched stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the dry season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
