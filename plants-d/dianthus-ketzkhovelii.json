    "intro": "Dianthus ketzkhovelii, commonly known as the Ketzkhovel pinks, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically features narrow, linear leaves and is adapted to cold, rocky environments. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants known for their ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
