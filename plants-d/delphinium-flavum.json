    "intro": "Delphinium flavum, commonly known as the yellow larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, adorned with clusters of showy, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, with lance-shaped leaflets that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens and rockeries."
