    "intro": "Dombeya shupangae var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth dombeya, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and often covered with a fine layer of hairs that become less prominent as the plant matures. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
