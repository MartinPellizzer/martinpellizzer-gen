    "intro": "Draba tundrostepposa, commonly known as the tundra-steppe draba, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arctic and alpine regions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are usually basal, linear, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Draba tundrostepposa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and supports local insect populations."
