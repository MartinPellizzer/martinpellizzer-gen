    "intro": "Diceros montanus, commonly known as the mountain dik dik, is a small antelope species native to the highland regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-shaped horns and a compact, stocky body adapted to its mountainous habitat. The animal is well-camouflaged in its environment, with a coat that blends with the rocky terrain. It primarily inhabits areas with dense vegetation, where it can find shelter and food. Due to habitat loss and hunting, the mountain dik dik is classified as vulnerable by the IUCN."
