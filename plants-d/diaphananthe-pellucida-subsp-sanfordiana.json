    "intro": "Diaphananthe pellucida subsp. sanfordiana, commonly known as the Sanford's ghostplant, is a rare aquatic fern that thrives in shallow, nutrient-poor wetlands. It possesses delicate, translucent leaves that float on the water surface, often appearing almost ethereal in appearance. The plant's rhizomes are wiry and anchor it to muddy substrates, while its spore-bearing structures are clustered in small, compact clusters. It is characterized by its lack of true roots and its ability to absorb nutrients directly through its leaves. This subspecies is native to specific regions in the southeastern United States, where it plays a unique role in its wetland ecosystem."
