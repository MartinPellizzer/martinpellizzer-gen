    "intro": "Davallia immersa, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of a true fern, though it is more closely related to the genus Dryopteris. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in damp soil. Its rhizomes are wiry and can spread to form dense mats. Davallia immersa is valued for its ornamental appearance and is commonly cultivated in water gardens and as a houseplant."
