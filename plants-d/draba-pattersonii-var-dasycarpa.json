    "intro": "Draba pattersonii var. dasycarpa, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada draba, is a low-growing perennial flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has a compact growth habit with basal leaves. It produces a cluster of small, rounded fruits known as siliques, which are distinctive in appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
