    "intro": "Drosera septentrionalis var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the northern sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects. The leaves are typically oblong in shape, giving the plant its specific variety name. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. This species is known for its ability to adapt to nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
