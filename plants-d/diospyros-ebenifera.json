    "intro": "Diospyros ebenifera, commonly known as the African ebony, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a leathery texture. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by small, round fruits containing one or two seeds. Diospyros ebenifera is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland and hill forest areas."
