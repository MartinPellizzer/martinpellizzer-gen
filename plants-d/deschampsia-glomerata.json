    "intro": "Deschampsia glomerata, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, tufted clumps. The plant produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Blue grama is well adapted to drought conditions and is an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
