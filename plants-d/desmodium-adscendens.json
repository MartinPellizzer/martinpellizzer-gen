    "intro": "Desmodium adscendens, commonly known as the climbing desmodium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its twining stems that climb around other plants, forming a dense canopy. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Desmodium adscendens is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for agricultural purposes."
