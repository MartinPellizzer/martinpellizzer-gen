    "intro": "Drosera trinervia, commonly known as the three-veined sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested by the plant. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of red or orange-colored secretions. Drosera trinervia is a perennial species that thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in coastal regions."
