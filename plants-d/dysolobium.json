    "intro": "Dysolobium, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It consists of a single species, Dysolobium parvifolium, which is native to South Africa. The plant is characterized by its basal leaves that are palmately lobed and its showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Dysolobium is often found in rocky or sandy soils in open, sunny habitats. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
