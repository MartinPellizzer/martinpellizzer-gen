    "intro": "Diplazium stubelii, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, humid environments. Its rhizome is short and creeping, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a slender and graceful appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
