    "intro": "Diplycosia rupicola, commonly known as the rock thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to harsh, dry environments."
