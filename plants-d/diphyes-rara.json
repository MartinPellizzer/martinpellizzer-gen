    "intro": "Diphyes rara, commonly known as the rare two-leaved plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinct morphology. It typically features two opposite leaves that are elongated and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Diphyes rara is considered a rare and endangered species."
