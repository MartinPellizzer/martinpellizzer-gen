    "intro": "Drosera heterophylla, commonly known as the variable sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the Droseraceae family and is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant exhibits morphological variation, with different leaf shapes depending on environmental conditions. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and wetlands. Its ability to adapt its morphology makes it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
