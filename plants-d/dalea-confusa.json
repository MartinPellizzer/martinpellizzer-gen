    "intro": "Dalea confusa, commonly known as the confused milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Dalea confusa plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
