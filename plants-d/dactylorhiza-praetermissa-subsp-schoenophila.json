    "intro": "Dactylorhiza praetermissa subsp. schoenophila, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to western Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features a slender, erect stem with few leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its roots are specialized for symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. This orchid is often found in moist, shaded environments and is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
