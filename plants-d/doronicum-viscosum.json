    "intro": "Doronicum viscosum, commonly known as the sticky goldcup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features upright, branching stems covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough, hairy texture. Doronicum viscosum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
