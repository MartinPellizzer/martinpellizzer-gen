    "intro": "Dracontia papillifera, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are simple and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its common name. Dracontia papillifera is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the consumption of prey for nutrition."
