    "intro": "Davallia vogelii, commonly known as the fern moss or velvet fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant has finely divided, soft, and silky fronds that give it a velvety appearance. It produces small, clustered spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the dry season. Davallia vogelii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate low light conditions."
