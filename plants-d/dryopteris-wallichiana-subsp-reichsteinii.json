    "intro": "Dryopteris wallichiana subsp. reichsteinii, commonly known as the Reichstein's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its robust fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountain forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,500 meters. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
