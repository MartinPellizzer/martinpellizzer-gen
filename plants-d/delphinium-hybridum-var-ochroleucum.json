    "intro": "Delphinium hybridum var. ochroleucum, commonly known as the white larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and lilac. The leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is also noted for its toxicity, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
