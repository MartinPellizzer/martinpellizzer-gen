    "intro": "Dendrochilum longicaule, commonly known as the long-stemmed tree orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a pseudobulbous structure with elongated, fleshy stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Dendrochilum longicaule is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
