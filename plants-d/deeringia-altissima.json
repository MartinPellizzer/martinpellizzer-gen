    "intro": "Deeringia altissima, commonly known as the tall deeringia, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange ray florets surrounded by a ring of smaller, tubular disk florets. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
