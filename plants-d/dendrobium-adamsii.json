    "intro": "Dendrobium adamsii, commonly known as the Adams' orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that are often covered in clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and bloom during the rainy season. Dendrobium adamsii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
