    "intro": "Daphne \u00d7 seibertii, commonly known as the winter daphne, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces clusters of fragrant, waxy flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that remain evergreen throughout the year. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its toxic sap, care should be taken when handling the plant."
