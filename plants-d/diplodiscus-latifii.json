    "intro": "Diplodiscus latifii, commonly known as the broadleaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are typically 10\u201330 cm in diameter. The plant has a delicate, lace-like appearance with numerous small, finger-like fronds extending from the central stem. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Diplodiscus latifii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
