    "intro": "Dorycnium herbaceum subsp. gracile, commonly known as the slender meadow vetch, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically features slender, upright stems covered with fine hairs and small, alternate leaves that are trifoliate or pinnate in structure. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in racemes along the stems. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows and grasslands. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
