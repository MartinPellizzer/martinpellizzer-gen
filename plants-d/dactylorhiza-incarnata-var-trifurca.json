    "intro": "Dactylorhiza incarnata var. trifurca, commonly known as the three-lobed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and damp grasslands in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a single, erect stem that bears several showy, pink to purple flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. The plant has a complex root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is relatively rare and is often protected in its natural habitat due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
