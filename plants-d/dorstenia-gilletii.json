    "intro": "Dorstenia gilletii, commonly known as the \"bottle tree,\" is a unique member of the Moraceae family, characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped stem that stores water. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are often hidden among its foliage. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Dorstenia gilletii is prized for its distinctive appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
