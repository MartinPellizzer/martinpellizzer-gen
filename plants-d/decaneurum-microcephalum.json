    "intro": "Decaneurum microcephalum, commonly known as the small-headed bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
