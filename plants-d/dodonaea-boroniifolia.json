    "intro": "Dodonaea boroniifolia, commonly known as the Boronii Dodonaea, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often serrated and have a distinctive, somewhat leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Dodonaea boroniifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
