    "intro": "Dombeya rigida subsp. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dombeya, is a shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting floral display."
