    "intro": "Doryopteris cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are often curled when young and unfurl as they mature. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern on the underside of the fronds. Doryopteris cordifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
