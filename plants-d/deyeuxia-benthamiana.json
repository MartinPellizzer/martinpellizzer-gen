It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
