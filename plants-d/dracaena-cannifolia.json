    "intro": "Dracaena cannifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dracaena, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a yellowish midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Dracaena cannifolia is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
