    "intro": "Distichlis prostrata, commonly known as flatleaf saltbush, is a low-growing perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions of the western United States. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh, arid environments. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and arranged in two rows along the stem. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typical of the Poaceae family. Distichlis prostrata is often used in xeriscaping and erosion control due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature."
