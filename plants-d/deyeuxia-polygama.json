    "intro": "Deyeuxia polygama, commonly known as the many-flowered flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often leafless above the base, with small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture. Deyeuxia polygama is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
