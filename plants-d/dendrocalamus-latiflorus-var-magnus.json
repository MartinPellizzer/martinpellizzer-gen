It is characterized by its robust, hollow stems that can reach heights of over 30 meters. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. It produces large, showy inflorescences with numerous pale yellow to white flowers. This variety is highly valued for its use in construction, crafts, and as a source of bamboo shoots."
