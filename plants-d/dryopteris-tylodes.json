    "intro": "Dryopteris tylodes, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, fertile fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, retaining their foliage throughout the year, which contributes to its ornamental value in gardens."
