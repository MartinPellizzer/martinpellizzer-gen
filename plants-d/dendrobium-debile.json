    "intro": "Dendrobium debile, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil. The plant has thin, wiry stems that are often covered in a layer of white or pale green moss. Its flowers are small and typically yellow or white, appearing in clusters during the summer months. Dendrobium debile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its delicate blooms."
