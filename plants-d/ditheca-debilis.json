    "intro": "Ditheca debilis, commonly known as the weakly branched daisy, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas and has slender, hairy stems. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in clusters, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypsela. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid conditions."
