It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that split open to release seeds. Drypetes spinulifolia is often found in lowland evergreen forests and is valued for its hard wood."
