    "intro": "Dendrobium victoriae-reginae var. miyakei, commonly known as the Imperial Orchid, is a rare and highly prized epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom once a year, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires careful attention to watering and nutrient balance. Due to its rarity and beauty, it is often cultivated in specialized greenhouses or by experienced growers."
