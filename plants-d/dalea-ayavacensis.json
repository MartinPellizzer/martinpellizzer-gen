    "intro": "Dalea ayavacensis, commonly known as Ayavacensis milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Dalea ayavacensis is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
