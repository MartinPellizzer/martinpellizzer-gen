    "intro": "Dendropanax cuneifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sassafras, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and have a distinctive cuneate (wedge-shaped) base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
