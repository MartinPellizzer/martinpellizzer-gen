    "intro": "Draba cinerea var. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, pale green to grayish leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the short summer season. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical features reflect its ability to survive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
