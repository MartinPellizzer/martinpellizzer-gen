    "intro": "Donia ciliata, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, succulent stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Donia ciliata is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
