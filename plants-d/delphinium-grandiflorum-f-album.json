    "intro": "Delphinium grandiflorum f. album, commonly known as the white larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of large, showy white or pale blue flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, blue-green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from grazing animals."
