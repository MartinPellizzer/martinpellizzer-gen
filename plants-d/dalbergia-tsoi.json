    "intro": "Dalbergia tsoi, commonly known as the Chinese rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, and it has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Dalbergia tsoi is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and the quality of its timber. However, it is also considered a vulnerable species due to overharvesting and habitat loss."
