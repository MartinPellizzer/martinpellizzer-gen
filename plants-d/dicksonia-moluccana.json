    "intro": "Dicksonia moluccana, commonly known as the mountain tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a robust rhizome that supports its growth and stores nutrients, allowing it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-bearing cones, called sori, are located on the undersides of its fronds, facilitating reproduction through spore dispersal. Dicksonia moluccana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in horticulture and landscape design."
