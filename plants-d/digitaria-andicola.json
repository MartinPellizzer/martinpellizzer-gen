    "intro": "Digitaria andicola, commonly known as the Andean digitaria, is a perennial grass species native to the Andes region of South America. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Digitaria andicola is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
