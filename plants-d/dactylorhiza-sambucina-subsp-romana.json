    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sambucina subsp. romana, commonly known as the Roman marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with a single, lance-shaped leaf and a spike of pale pink to purple flowers. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
