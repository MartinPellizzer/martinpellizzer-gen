    "intro": "Delphinium laxiflorum var. leiocarpum, commonly known as the woolly delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in racemes. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a woolly texture on both sides, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils."
