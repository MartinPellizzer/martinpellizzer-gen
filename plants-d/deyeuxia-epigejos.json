    "intro": "Deyeuxia epigejos, commonly known as the broad-leaved flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense vegetation. Deyeuxia epigejos is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
