    "intro": "Diplostephium pleistogynum, commonly known as the pleistogynum mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It has small, elliptical leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement and lack stipules. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it relies on its host for water and nutrients. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid forest environments."
