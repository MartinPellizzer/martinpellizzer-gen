It is characterized by its striking white petals and delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are small but numerous, arranged in clusters that enhance its visual appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
