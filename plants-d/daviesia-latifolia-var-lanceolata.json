It is characterized by its lance-shaped, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. It is adapted to dry conditions and has a woody structure that allows it to survive in arid environments. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
