    "intro": "Dodonaea conglomerata, commonly known as the sticky devil or red devil, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, glandular foliage that secretes a sticky resin, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Dodonaea conglomerata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soils in arid environments."
