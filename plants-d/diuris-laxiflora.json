    "intro": "Diuris laxiflora, commonly known as the slender-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in heathlands and open woodlands. The plant produces a single or few erect stems with linear leaves, and its flowers are small, greenish-yellow with a distinctive hooded labellum. It blooms in late winter to early spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and wasps. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
