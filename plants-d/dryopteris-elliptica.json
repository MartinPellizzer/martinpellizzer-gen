    "intro": "Dryopteris elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a hairy indusium."
