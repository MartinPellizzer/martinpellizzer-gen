    "intro": "Dracaena sessiliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dracaena, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, narrow, dark green leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena sessiliflora is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying properties and low maintenance requirements."
