    "intro": "Deckera aculeata, commonly known as the African spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas. The plant features erect stems with small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers. Its sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care. It is often used in traditional medicine, though its medicinal properties remain largely unstudied."
