    "intro": "Dendrobium erectifolium, commonly known as the upright-leaf dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender stems that can reach several feet in length, often with clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern and are thick and fleshy to store water. Dendrobium erectifolium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
