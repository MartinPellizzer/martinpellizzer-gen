    "intro": "Dryadella butcheri, commonly known as the Butcher's dryad, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
