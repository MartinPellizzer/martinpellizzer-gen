    "intro": "Diplazium elegans, commonly known as the elegant water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
