    "intro": "Dioscorea dejantiana, commonly known as the African yam bean, is a climbing perennial vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part. These tubers are rich in carbohydrates and have been traditionally used as a food source in several African countries. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
