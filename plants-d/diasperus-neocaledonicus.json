    "intro": "Diasperus neocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonia mountain fern, is a unique plant species native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the mountainous regions of the island. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
