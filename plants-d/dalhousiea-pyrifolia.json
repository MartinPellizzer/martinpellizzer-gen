    "intro": "Dalhousiea pyrifolia, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking member of the Xanthorrhoeaceae family, native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its vivid red and orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Dalhousiea pyrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its dramatic visual impact."
