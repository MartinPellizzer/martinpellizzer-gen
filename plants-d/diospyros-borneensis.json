    "intro": "Diospyros borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean persimmon, is a deciduous tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with a glossy surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits. Its fruit is edible, though often astringent when unripe, and is used in local cuisines. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and construction."
