    "intro": "Dicksonia prolifera, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, dark brown rind. The plant produces a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. It reproduces via spores, which are released from the fertile fronds that develop at the tips of the plant. Dicksonia prolifera thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas."
