    "intro": "Davallia multifida, commonly known as the Bird's Nest Fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped fronds that form a dense, cup-like structure resembling a bird's nest. The plant has long, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as a decorative plant in tropical gardens. The fronds are not only aesthetically pleasing but also serve as a microhabitat for small organisms."
