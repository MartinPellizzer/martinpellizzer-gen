    "intro": "Dulcamara flexuosa, commonly known as the climbing nightshade, is a perennial vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. However, it is considered toxic due to the presence of alkaloids in its leaves and berries."
