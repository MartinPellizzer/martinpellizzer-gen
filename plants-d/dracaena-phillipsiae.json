    "intro": "Dracaena phillipsiae, commonly known as the Red-veined Dracaena, is a tropical evergreen plant native to the island of Saint Helena. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that have deep red veins against a dark green background. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena phillipsiae is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
