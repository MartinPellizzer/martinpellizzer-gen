    "intro": "Digitaria adscendens var. sericea, commonly known as silky fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs on the leaf blades and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as pastures, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle with closely spaced spikelets, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate various environmental conditions."
