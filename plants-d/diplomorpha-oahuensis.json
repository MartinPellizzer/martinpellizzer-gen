    "intro": "Diplomorpha oahuensis, commonly known as the Oahu ironwood, is a rare endemic tree native to the Hawaiian island of Oahu. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and sturdy, branching structure. The plant has small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils, making it an important component of Hawaii's unique ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
