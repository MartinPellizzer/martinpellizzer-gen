    "intro": "Dalibarda violioides, commonly known as the violetleaf dalibarda, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring, often before its leaves emerge. Its root system consists of a thick, fleshy rhizome, which helps it survive in rocky, well-drained soils. Dalibarda violioides is often found in open woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in partial shade."
