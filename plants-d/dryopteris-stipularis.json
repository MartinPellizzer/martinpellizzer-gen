    "intro": "Dryopteris stipularis, commonly known as the stiff-veined wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments with prominent, stiff veins that give the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients effectively."
