    "intro": "Dipseudochorion, commonly known as the double pseudochorion, is a unique botanical structure found in certain fungal spores. It consists of two layers of chitin, which provide structural support and protection to the spore. This feature is particularly notable in the genus *Puccinia*, where it plays a role in the spore's dispersal and survival. The double pseudochorion enhances the spore's resistance to environmental stressors. Its presence is a key diagnostic trait in the classification of specific fungal species."
