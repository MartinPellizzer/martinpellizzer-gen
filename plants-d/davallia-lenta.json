    "intro": "Davallia lenta, commonly known as the slow-growing fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that form a dense, low-growing carpet. The plant thrives in shady, humid environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize rocky crevices and forest floors. Davallia lenta is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded garden beds or as a houseplant."
