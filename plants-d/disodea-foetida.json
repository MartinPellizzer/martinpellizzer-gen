    "intro": "Disodea foetida, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a distinctive, pungent odor, which is likely a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Disodea foetida grows in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils."
