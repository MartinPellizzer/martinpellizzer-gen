    "intro": "Dryopteris tatei, commonly known as the Japanese wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Dryopteris tatei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
