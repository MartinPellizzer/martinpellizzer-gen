    "intro": "Dendrobium rumphiae var. quinquenervium, commonly known as the Five-veined Dendrobium, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery). It produces strikingly colorful flowers, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
