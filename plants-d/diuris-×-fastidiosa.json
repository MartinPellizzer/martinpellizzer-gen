    "intro": "Diuris \u00d7 fastidiosa, commonly known as the hybrid spider orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Diuris corynophora and Diuris tuberculata. It is a perennial herb with a compact, low-growing habit and features intricate, spider-like flowers in shades of pink and purple. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears several flower spikes, each with multiple flowers arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant collections. Due to its ornamental value and rarity in the wild, it is often cultivated by horticulturists and conservationists."
