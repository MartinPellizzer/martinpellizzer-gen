    "intro": "Daphniphyllum longeracemosum, commonly known as the long-branch holly, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in the Daphniphyllaceae family."
