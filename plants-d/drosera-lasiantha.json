    "intro": "Drosera lasiantha, commonly known as the large-leaved sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which the plant then digests to supplement its nutrient intake. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swamps. Its leaves are broad and often covered in a dense layer of dew-like secretions. Drosera lasiantha is a perennial species that produces small white flowers during the spring and summer months."
