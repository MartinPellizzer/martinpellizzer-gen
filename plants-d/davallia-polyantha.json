    "intro": "Davallia polyantha, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sorus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Davallia polyantha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
