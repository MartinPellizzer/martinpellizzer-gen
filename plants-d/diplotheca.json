    "intro": "Diplotheca, commonly known as the \"false hibiscus,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It comprises several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their showy, often colorful flowers that are typically five-petaled and resemble those of the hibiscus. Their leaves are usually palmately lobed, and the stems are often covered with fine hairs. Diplotheca species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant blooms."
