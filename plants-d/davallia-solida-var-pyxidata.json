It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new growth along the soil surface. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens."
