    "intro": "Dysoxylum championii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to regions of Africa and the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree produces woody capsules that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is valued for its durable, heavy timber, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its range."
