    "intro": "Davallia roxburghii, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Davallia roxburghii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
