    "intro": "Didymopogon sumatranum, commonly known as the Sumatran feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
