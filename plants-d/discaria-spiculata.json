    "intro": "Discaria spiculata, commonly known as the spiked discaria, is a small shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Discaria spiculata is often used in ornamental gardening due to its compact form and ability to tolerate drought."
