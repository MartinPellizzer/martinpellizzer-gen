    "intro": "Dieterlea maxima, commonly known as the giant dieterlea, is a striking plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is a member of the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Dieterlea maxima is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical botanical gardens. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
