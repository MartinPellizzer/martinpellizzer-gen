    "intro": "Dichanthelium lanuginosum var. thermale, commonly known as the thermophilic silkygrass, is a perennial grass species native to warm, dry habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and dense, clump-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its range."
