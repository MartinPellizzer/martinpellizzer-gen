It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous form with narrow, linear leaves. It produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
