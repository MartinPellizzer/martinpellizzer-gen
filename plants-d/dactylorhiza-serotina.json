    "intro": "Dactylorhiza serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear a single spike of pale to dark purple flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and heathlands. It has linear to lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-brown pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Dactylorhiza serotina is a perennial species that blooms from late summer to early autumn."
