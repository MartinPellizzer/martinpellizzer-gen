    "intro": "Dactylorchis majalis, commonly known as the fairy orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in acidic soils. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, delicate flower with a distinctive pinkish-brown coloration. Its flowers are highly fragrant, especially in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many parts of its range."
