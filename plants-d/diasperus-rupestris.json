    "intro": "Diasperus rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, compact growth habit and produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and well-drained soils, adapting to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Diasperus rupestris is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
