    "intro": "Draba olgae subsp. chitralensis, commonly known as the Chitral Draba, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to the harsh, cold climates it inhabits. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
