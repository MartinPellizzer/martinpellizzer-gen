    "intro": "Diplazium siamense, commonly known as the Siam fork fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sorangia. Diplazium siamense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture and landscape design."
