    "intro": "Dionysia avia, commonly known as the sky vine, is a climbing plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features slender, woody stems that can reach lengths of several meters, allowing it to climb trees and rock faces. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Dionysia avia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
