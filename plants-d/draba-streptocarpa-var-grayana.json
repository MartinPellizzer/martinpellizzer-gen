    "intro": "Draba streptocarpa var. grayana, commonly known as the grayleaf whitlow grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant has a compact rosette of basal leaves that are gray-green in color, giving it its common name. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. The species is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
