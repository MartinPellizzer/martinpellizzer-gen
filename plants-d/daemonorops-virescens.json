    "intro": "Daemonorops virescens, commonly known as the green fan palm, is a species of cycad-like plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive palm-like appearance. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces small, greenish flowers. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is adapted to grow in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
