    "intro": "Daphne capitellata, commonly known as the clustered daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, rounded clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy blossoms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Daphne capitellata is also noted for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
