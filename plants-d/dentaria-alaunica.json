    "intro": "Dentaria alaunica, commonly known as the alpine toothplant, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
