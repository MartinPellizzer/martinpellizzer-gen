    "intro": "Dillenia tomentella, commonly known as the woolly dillenia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers with five petals, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its fruit is a fleshy, spiny capsule that splits open to release seeds. Dillenia tomentella is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as mountain forests and riverine areas."
