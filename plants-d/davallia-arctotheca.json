    "intro": "Davallia arctotheca, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to South Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Davallia arctotheca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
