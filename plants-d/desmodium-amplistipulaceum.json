    "intro": "Desmodium amplistipulaceum, commonly known as the broad-leaf desmodium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, kidney-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Desmodium amplistipulaceum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration and soil enrichment."
