It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds covered in hooked bristles, which aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Dorycnium iberecum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
