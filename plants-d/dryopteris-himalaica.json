    "intro": "Dryopteris himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, intricately divided fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous cover."
