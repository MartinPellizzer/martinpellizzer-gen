    "intro": "Drepanocarpus, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are native to Africa and are characterized by their hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for its durability. The leaves are usually opposite and elliptic, with a glossy surface, while the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a drupe, typically containing a single seed, and the plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Drepanocarpus species are also known for their ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
