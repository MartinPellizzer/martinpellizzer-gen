    "intro": "Dicksonia zippeliana, commonly known as the Zippel's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a dense mat, helping to stabilize the soil in its natural habitat. Its fronds are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside, with a smooth texture. Dicksonia zippeliana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
