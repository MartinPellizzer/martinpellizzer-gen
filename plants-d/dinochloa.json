It is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like structure and is typically found in shallow coastal waters. Dinochloa plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by serving as a primary food source for various aquatic organisms. The plant contains chlorophyll, allowing it to perform photosynthesis and contribute to oxygen production. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important indicator of water quality in coastal regions."
