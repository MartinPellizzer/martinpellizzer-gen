    "intro": "Disporum brachystemon, commonly known as the dwarf lily of the valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its clustered, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15\u201330 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Disporum brachystemon is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks."
