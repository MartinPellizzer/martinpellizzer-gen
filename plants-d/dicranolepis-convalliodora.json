    "intro": "Dicranolepis convalliodora, commonly known as the yellow moss or velvet moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a thalloid structure with a central axis and is often covered in a layer of fine, velvety hairs. It thrives in humid climates and is commonly found in forest floors or on rocky substrates. Due to its unique morphology and ecological preferences, it plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
