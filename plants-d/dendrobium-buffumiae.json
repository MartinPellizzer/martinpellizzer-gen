    "intro": "Dendrobium buffumiae, commonly known as the Buffum's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are long and strap-like, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Dendrobium buffumiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
