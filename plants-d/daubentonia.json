    "intro": "Daubentonia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical Africa and are characterized by their velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers. Daubentonia species typically produce flowers in shades of violet, pink, and white, often with a distinctive pattern of darker markings. They are popular as houseplants due to their compact size and ability to thrive in indirect light. The genus includes several species, such as Daubentonia taurina, which is particularly prized for its ornamental value."
