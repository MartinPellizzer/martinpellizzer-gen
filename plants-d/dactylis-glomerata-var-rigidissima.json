It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, spikelet-based flowers. It is valued for its hardiness and is commonly used in forage and erosion control. Its botanical features make it well-suited for agricultural and ecological applications."
