    "intro": "Dryopteris sancta var. magna, commonly known as the giant lady fern, is a variant of the lady fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to three feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodlands and stream banks. Its fertile fronds produce spores in clusters, contributing to its reproductive cycle. The botanical features of this fern make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
