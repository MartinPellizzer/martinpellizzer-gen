    "intro": "Digitaria gayana, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments due to its deep root system and drought tolerance. Digitaria gayana is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop because of its resilience and low maintenance requirements."
