    "intro": "Digitaria ventriosa, commonly known as the hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Digitaria ventriosa is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
