    "intro": "Dipterocarpus cuspidatus, commonly known as the sharp-pointed dipterocarp, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its large, spreading crown and buttressed roots. The tree produces heavy, woody fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, edible aril. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. This species is valued for its durable timber and plays an important ecological role in tropical rainforests."
