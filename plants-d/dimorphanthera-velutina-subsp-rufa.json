    "intro": "Dimorphanthera velutina subsp. rufa, commonly known as the red-flowered velvet orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green foliage and vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near streams or in mountainous regions. Its unique floral structure includes a spurred lip, a feature common in many orchid species, which aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
