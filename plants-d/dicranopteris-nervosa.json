    "intro": "Dicranopteris nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely veined fronds that are typically submerged or floating in still or slow-moving freshwater. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread across the water surface, forming dense mats. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a distinctive midrib and numerous parallel veins. Dicranopteris nervosa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling."
