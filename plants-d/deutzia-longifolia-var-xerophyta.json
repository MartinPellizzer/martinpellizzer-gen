    "intro": "Deutzia longifolia var. xerophyta, commonly known as the desert deutzia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It features narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry climates. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for drought-tolerant gardens and rocky landscapes."
