    "intro": "Dudleya nevadensis subsp. minor, commonly known as the Sierra Valley Dudleya, is a succulent plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically gray-green in color with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to a Mediterranean climate with dry summers and wet winters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
