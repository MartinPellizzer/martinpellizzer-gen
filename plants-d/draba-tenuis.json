    "intro": "Draba tenuis, commonly known as the slender whitlowgrass, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features basal leaves that are linear and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Draba tenuis is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in many regions."
