    "intro": "Dendrobium tricolor, commonly known as the three-colored orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its strikingly colorful flowers, which typically feature three distinct color zones on each petal. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its unique appearance. Dendrobium tricolor is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
