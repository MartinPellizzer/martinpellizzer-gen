    "intro": "Dodecatheon hendersonii subsp. cruciatum, commonly known as the Henderson's glory-of-the-snow, is a rare and delicate wildflower native to the western United States. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The subspecies cruciatum is distinguished by its distinctive cruciform (cross-shaped) petals and is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and conservation status."
