It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plants are characterized by their small, showy flowers that often have a yellow or golden hue, surrounded by green or brown bracts. Dutailliopsis species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in their natural habitat. These orchids are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
