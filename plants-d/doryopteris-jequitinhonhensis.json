    "intro": "Doryopteris jequitinhonhensis, commonly known as the Brazilian holly fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae, characterized by its distinctive fronds and spore-bearing structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a unique arrangement of pinnae and pinnules that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for both botanical research and conservation efforts."
