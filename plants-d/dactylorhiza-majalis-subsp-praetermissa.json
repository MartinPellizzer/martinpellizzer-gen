    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis subsp. praetermissa, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a rhizomatous herb with tall, slender stems that bear several lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single spike of white or pale green flowers, which are often overlooked due to their subdued color. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and more delicate appearance compared to other Dactylorhiza species."
