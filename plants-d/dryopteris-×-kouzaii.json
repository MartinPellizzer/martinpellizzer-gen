    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 kouzaii, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid fern resulting from the cross between Dryopteris japonica and Dryopteris affinis. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
