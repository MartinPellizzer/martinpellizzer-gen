It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow, globular inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
