    "intro": "Dioon merolae, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone, is a rare cycad species native to the Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a dense crown of stiff, dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant produces large, spherical cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Dioon merolae is adapted to arid and rocky environments, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
