    "intro": "Diplotropis duckei, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in musical instruments, it has been subject to overharvesting and is now considered endangered in some areas."
