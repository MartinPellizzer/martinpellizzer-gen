    "intro": "Draba fastigiata, commonly known as the upright whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches a height of 5 to 15 centimeters and features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Draba fastigiata is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
