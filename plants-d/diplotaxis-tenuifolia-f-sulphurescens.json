It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is notable for its sulfur-yellow coloration, which is most prominent in its flower heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed or open habitats. This form is distinguished by its unique coloration and is of interest in botanical studies for its adaptive traits."
