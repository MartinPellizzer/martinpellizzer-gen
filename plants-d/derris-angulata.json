    "intro": "Derris angulata, commonly known as the angular derris, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, also known as the legume or pea family. The plant is characterized by its angular, woody stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. Derris angulata is known for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of rotenone, a natural insecticide."
