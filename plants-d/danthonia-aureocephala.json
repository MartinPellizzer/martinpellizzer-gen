    "intro": "Danthonia aureocephala, commonly known as the golden-headed danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and distinctive golden-colored inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late spring. Danthonia aureocephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
