    "intro": "Dryas integrifolia subsp. chamissonis, commonly known as Chamisson's mountain avens, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, hairy, and often blue-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in a cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of the local flora in its native range."
