    "intro": "Dioscorea wrightii, commonly known as the Wright yam, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its helical stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and cylindrical, tuberous roots that are used in traditional medicine. Its tubers are also edible when properly prepared, though they contain toxic compounds that require careful processing. Dioscorea wrightii is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for both its medicinal and nutritional properties."
