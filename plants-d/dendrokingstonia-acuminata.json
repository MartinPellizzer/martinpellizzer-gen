    "intro": "Dendrokingstonia acuminata, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often described as resembling the leaves of a tree. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Dendrokingstonia acuminata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
