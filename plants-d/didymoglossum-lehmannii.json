    "intro": "Didymoglossum lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's hairgrass, is a small perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is often found in disturbed or nutrient-poor soils. Didymoglossum lehmannii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
