    "intro": "Drymocallis lactea var. austiniae, commonly known as Austin's milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is typically found in moist to wet soils along streambanks and wetlands. This variety is notable for its role in supporting local pollinators, including butterflies and bees."
