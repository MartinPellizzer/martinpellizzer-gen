    "intro": "Dyctiogramme, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed, resembling a tiny four-leaf clover. These plants are often found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Dyctiogramme species are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and can form dense mats on the water surface. Their reproductive structures, including small flowers and fruits, are adapted for dispersal by water currents."
