    "intro": "Diospyros nigrocortex, commonly known as black-barked persimmon, is a species of flowering plant in the Ebenaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its dark, almost black bark, which gives it its common name, and its large, heart-shaped leaves. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange to reddish fruits. The fruit is typically edible, though some varieties may have astringent properties when unripe."
