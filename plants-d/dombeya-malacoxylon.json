    "intro": "Dombeya malacoxylon, commonly known as the silky dombeya, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its soft, silvery foliage and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
