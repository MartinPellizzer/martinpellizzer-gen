    "intro": "Desmodium lactescens, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions. Desmodium lactescens is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
