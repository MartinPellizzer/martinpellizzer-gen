    "intro": "Decorima, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering its leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. Its bark is smooth and light-colored, often exuding a resin when damaged. The silverleaf tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
