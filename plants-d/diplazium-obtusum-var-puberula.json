    "intro": "Diplazium obtusum var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, sword-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its unique botanical profile."
