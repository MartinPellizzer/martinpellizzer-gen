    "intro": "Dichanthelium arenicoloides, commonly known as sand grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils, often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. Dichanthelium arenicoloides is adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray and periodic flooding."
