    "intro": "Dryopteris glabra var. hobdyana, commonly known as the Hobdyana shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
