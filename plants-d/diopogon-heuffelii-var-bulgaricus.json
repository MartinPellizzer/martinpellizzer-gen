    "intro": "Diopogon heuffelii var. bulgaricus, commonly known as the Bulgarian diopogon, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Its foliage is often finely divided, giving it a delicate appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
