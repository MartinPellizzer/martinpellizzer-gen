    "intro": "Draba argentea, commonly known as silver mountain-cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are often covered in a silvery or whitish coating of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, typically blooming in early spring. Native to alpine and arctic regions, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a rock garden plant."
