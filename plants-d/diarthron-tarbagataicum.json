It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid regions."
