    "intro": "Didymiandrum stellatum, commonly known as the star-shaped flat moss, is a unique species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and its distinctive star-shaped thalli, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rock crevices or forest floors, where it can retain adequate moisture. Its reproductive structures, called gametophores, are often clustered and contribute to its ornamental appearance. Didymiandrum stellatum is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in specialized garden settings."
