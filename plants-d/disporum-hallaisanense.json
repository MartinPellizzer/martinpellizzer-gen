    "intro": "Disporum hallaisanense, commonly known as the Hallaisan disporum, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Korea. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
