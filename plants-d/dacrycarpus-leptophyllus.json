    "intro": "Dacrycarpus leptophyllus, commonly known as the slender-leaved rimu, is a tall evergreen conifer native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain both male and female reproductive structures. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in native forests. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable component of New Zealand's biodiversity."
