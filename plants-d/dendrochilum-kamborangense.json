It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its pendulous inflorescences bearing showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow with intricate patterns, and it blooms during the rainy season. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
