    "intro": "Dalbergia boehmii, commonly known as African rosewood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Central and East Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, reddish-brown color and a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and is valued for its hard, durable wood used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
