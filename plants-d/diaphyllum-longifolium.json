    "intro": "Diaphyllum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved diaphyllum, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Diaphyllaceae and is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
