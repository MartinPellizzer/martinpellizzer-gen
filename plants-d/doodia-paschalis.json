It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically green and slightly glossy. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Doodia paschalis plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
