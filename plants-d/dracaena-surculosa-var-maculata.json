    "intro": "Dracaena surculosa var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted dracaena, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features dark green, strap-like leaves with distinctive white or yellow spots along the midrib, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
