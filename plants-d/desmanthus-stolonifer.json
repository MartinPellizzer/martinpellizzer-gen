    "intro": "Desmanthus stolonifer, commonly known as the creeping desmanthus, is a perennial legume native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which are borne in clusters along the stems. Its trifoliate leaves are alternate and have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Desmanthus stolonifer is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils."
