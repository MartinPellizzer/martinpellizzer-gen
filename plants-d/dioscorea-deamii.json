It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by cylindrical, spiny fruits containing numerous seeds.

The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential medicinal properties."
