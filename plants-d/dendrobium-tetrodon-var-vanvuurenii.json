It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features long, wiry pseudobulbs covered in dense, leathery leaves. Its flowers are showy, with vibrant colors and a unique, intricate pattern resembling a snake's skin, hence its common name. It requires specific care, including high humidity and well-draining soil, to thrive."
