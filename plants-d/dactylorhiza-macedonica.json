    "intro": "Dactylorhiza macedonica, commonly known as the Macedonian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Balkan region. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It has a complex root system and is often associated with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
