    "intro": "Dendrobium kolposense, commonly known as the Kolposense orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are usually small, fragrant, and come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and yellow. Dendrobium kolposense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
