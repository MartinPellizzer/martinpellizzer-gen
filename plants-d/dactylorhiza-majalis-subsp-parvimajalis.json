    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis subsp. parvimajalis, commonly known as the small-flowered marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as peat bogs and damp woodlands. The plant has a slender, often reddish stem that bears few leaves and a cluster of small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for nutrient uptake. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flowers and shorter stature compared to other Dactylorhiza species."
