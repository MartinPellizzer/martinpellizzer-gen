    "intro": "Digitaria simpsonii, commonly known as Simpson's Digitaria, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Digitaria simpsonii is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
