    "intro": "Deutzia floribunda var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent deutzia, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a hairy texture that gives the plant its varietal name. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden borders or as a foundation plant. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
