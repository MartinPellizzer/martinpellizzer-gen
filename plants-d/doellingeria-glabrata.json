    "intro": "Doellingeria glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its smooth, broad leaves that float on the surface of shallow water. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, typically with four petals. Its roots are adapted to aquatic environments, allowing it to thrive in muddy or sandy substrates. Doellingeria glabrata plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
