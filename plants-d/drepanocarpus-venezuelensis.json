    "intro": "Drepanocarpus venezuelensis, commonly known as the Venezuelan hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Venezuela. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with rough, bark-like stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces capsules that contain numerous small, hairy seeds. Drepanocarpus venezuelensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
