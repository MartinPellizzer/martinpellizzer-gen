    "intro": "Delphinium chenii, commonly known as the Chen's larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough texture and a distinctive, somewhat unpleasant odor. Delphinium chenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids that require careful handling."
