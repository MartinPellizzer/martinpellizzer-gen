    "intro": "Dryopteris austriaca f. deltoidea, commonly known as the delta-shaped Austrian wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a triangular or deltoid shape, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant has a robust rhizome system that helps it anchor and spread in suitable habitats. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
