    "intro": "Delphinium cerefolium, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, bearing clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and its flowers are typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
