    "intro": "Digitaria cognata, commonly known as the slender fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas, along stream banks, and in swampy woodlands. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of small spikelets, which produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Digitaria cognata plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides habitat for various insect species."
