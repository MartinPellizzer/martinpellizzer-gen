It is characterized by its narrow, silvery-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are arranged in panicle-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Daviesia paniculata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
