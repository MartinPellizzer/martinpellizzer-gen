    "intro": "Diplazium aemulum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with narrow, lance-shaped segments that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. Diplazium aemulum thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical forests."
