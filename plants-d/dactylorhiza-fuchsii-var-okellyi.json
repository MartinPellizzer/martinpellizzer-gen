    "intro": "Dactylorhiza fuchsii var. okellyi, commonly known as the Okelly's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a complex root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Its leaves are usually linear and grass-like, and it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. This variant is distinguished by its distinctive floral coloration and is often found in wet meadows and woodland edges."
