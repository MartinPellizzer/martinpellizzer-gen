    "intro": "Dianella longifolia var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf flax lily, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to New Zealand. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and form dense, compact clumps. The plant produces striking white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by dark blue, egg-shaped berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form attractive ground covers and its resilience to coastal conditions."
