    "intro": "Dryopteris intermedia subsp. maderensis, commonly known as the Mader's wood fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
