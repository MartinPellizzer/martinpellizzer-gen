    "intro": "Dendrobium compressicaule, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, cane-like stem covered in short, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green and narrow. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, lance-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often blooming during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Dendrobium compressicaule is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
