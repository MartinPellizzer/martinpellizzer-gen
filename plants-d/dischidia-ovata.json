    "intro": "Dischidia ovata, commonly known as the bubble vine, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that often appear swollen, resembling bubbles, hence its common name. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This plant is popular in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
