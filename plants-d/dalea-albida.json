    "intro": "Dalea albida, commonly known as white milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Dalea albida plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
