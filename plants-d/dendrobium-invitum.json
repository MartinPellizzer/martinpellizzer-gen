    "intro": "Dendrobium invitum, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems that grow horizontally and produce new growth from the base. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often with a distinctive lip that is broader than the other petals. Its leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Dendrobium invitum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
