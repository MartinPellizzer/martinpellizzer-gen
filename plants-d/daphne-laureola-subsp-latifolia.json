    "intro": "Daphne laureola subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf daphne, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with oval to elliptical leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by small, orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires caution when handling."
