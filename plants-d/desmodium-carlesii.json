    "intro": "Desmodium carlesii, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered pods containing edible seeds that are rich in protein and used in local cuisines. Desmodium carlesii is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in agricultural systems. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions for both decorative and practical purposes."
