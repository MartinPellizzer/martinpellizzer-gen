    "intro": "Dendrophthoe falcata var. amplexifolia, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the stems of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant's stems are fleshy and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested areas where its host trees thrive."
