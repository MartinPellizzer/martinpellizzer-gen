    "intro": "Dorstenia longicauda, commonly known as the long-tailed spider plant, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, white, spider-like flowers. The leaves are typically elongated and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a ground cover. The plant's unique appearance and adaptability make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native environment."
