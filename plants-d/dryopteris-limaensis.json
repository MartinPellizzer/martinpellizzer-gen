    "intro": "Dryopteris limaensis, commonly known as the Lima Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive shield-shaped base. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. The fern's robust growth and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
