    "intro": "Deutzia hayatae, commonly known as the Japanese deutzia, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features slender, arching branches with opposite, ovate leaves. Its ornamental value comes from its showy floral display and its ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun. Deutzia hayatae is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
