It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight serration along the edges. Dodonaea calycina is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
