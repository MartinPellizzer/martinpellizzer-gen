It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes. The plant produces distinctive, hooked burrs that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and agricultural contexts."
