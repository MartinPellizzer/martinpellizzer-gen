    "intro": "Draba fladnizensis var. traunsteineri, commonly known as the Traunsteiner's whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many species with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms low, compact rosettes of narrow, linear leaves. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and appear in clusters, often blooming in late spring to early summer. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the type species."
