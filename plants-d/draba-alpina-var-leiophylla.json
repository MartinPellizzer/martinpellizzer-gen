    "intro": "Draba alpina var. leiophylla, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and small, yellow or white flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh alpine environments, featuring a compact growth form to minimize heat loss and withstand strong winds. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, aiding in water retention in nutrient-poor soils. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, leathery leaves, which set it apart from other Draba species."
