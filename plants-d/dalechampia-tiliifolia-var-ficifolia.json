    "intro": "Dalechampia tiliifolia var. ficifolia, commonly known as the fig-leaf dalechampia, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the common fig tree. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers followed by yellowish fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
