It has a dark green to blackish upper surface with a distinctive, rough texture. The lower surface is white and covered with small, rounded lobes. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests. This lichen plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality."
