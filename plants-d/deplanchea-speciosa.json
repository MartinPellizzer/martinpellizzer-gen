    "intro": "Deplanchea speciosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are thick and velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking foliage. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
