    "intro": "Datura metel var. dentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved angel's trumpet, is a striking perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features large, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, with a strong, sometimes unpleasant fragrance. The leaves are narrow and serrated, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. However, all parts of the plant are toxic and should be handled with care."
