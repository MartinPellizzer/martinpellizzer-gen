    "intro": "Dasiphora anserina, commonly known as the white clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Dasiphora anserina is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
