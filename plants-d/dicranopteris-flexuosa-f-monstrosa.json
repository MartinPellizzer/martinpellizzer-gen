It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant exhibits a distinctive, irregular growth pattern with twisted and curled fronds, giving it a striking, almost sculptural appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture and botanical collections."
