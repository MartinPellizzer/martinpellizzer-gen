    "intro": "Discurea, commonly known as the death's-head flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, often showy flowers that can resemble human faces or other intriguing shapes. Discurea species are typically found in temperate regions and are known for their toxic properties due to the presence of alkaloids. The leaves are usually alternate and have a distinctive, often wavy margin. Many species of Discurea are cultivated for their ornamental value despite their poisonous nature."
