    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. micrantha, commonly known as the slender oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It is well adapted to temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
