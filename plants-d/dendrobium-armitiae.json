    "intro": "Dendrobium armitiae, commonly known as the Armitage's orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in two rows along the stem. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
