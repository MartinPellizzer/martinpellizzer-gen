    "intro": "Dioscorea majungensis, commonly known as the Majungensis yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part of the plant. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and tend to climb by means of tendrils. The tubers are valued for their starchy content and are used in traditional cuisines across its native range."
