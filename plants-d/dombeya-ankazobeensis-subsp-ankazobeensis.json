    "intro": "Dombeya ankazobeensis subsp. ankazobeensis, commonly known as the Ankazobe dombeya, is a shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in clusters. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
