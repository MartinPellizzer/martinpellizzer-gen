    "intro": "Dupatya guyanensis, commonly known as the Guyana starleaf, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub in humid, shaded environments, often found in the rainforests of Guyana and adjacent regions. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dupatya guyanensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
