    "intro": "Dondia brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved dondia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks. Its leaves are short and broad, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Dondia brevifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
