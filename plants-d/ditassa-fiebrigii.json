    "intro": "Ditassa fiebrigii, commonly known as the Cape mountain catchfly, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
