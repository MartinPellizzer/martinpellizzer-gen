    "intro": "Dyssochroma atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic dyssochroma, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the western Atlantic. It is a small shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Dyssochroma atlantica thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its ability to withstand salt spray and coastal winds makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
