    "intro": "Diplazium wichurae var. wichurae, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant features a creeping rhizome with dark brown, wiry roots and produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds. Its leaves are bipinnate, with narrow, lance-shaped pinnae that are often slightly curled at the edges. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
