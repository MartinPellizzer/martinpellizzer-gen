    "intro": "Diphaca cochinchinensis f. grandifoliolata, commonly known as the large-leafed diphaca, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with compound leaves that are alternate and pinnately arranged. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, and it produces red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
