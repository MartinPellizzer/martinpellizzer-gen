    "intro": "Decateles lycioides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small shrub native to the eastern and southern regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its hard, durable wood. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered threatened in many parts of its native range."
