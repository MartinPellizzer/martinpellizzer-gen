    "intro": "Doellingeria, commonly known as the marsh milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit and the presence of milky sap, which is a common feature among members of the mallow family. The plants typically have alternate, heart-shaped leaves and produce showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white. Doellingeria species are often found in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, where they thrive in nutrient-rich soils. These plants play an important role in supporting local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
