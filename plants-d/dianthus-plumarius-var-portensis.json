It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of bright pink or white flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, round seed capsules that mature in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and long blooming period contribute to its ornamental value in gardens."
