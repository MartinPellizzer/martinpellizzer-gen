    "intro": "Dicraeia filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf dune grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikelets, and it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Dicraeia filifolia is an important component of coastal vegetation, contributing to erosion control and habitat provision for various wildlife species."
