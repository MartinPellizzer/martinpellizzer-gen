    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. subsessilis, commonly known as mouse-tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, clustered spikelets that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, wastelands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-gray hue, and it produces pale green to brown flowers in late summer. This variety is often used in forage and soil stabilization due to its hardiness and adaptability."
