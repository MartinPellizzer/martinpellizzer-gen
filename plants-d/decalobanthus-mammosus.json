    "intro": "Decalobanthus mammosus, commonly known as the giant milkweed, is a striking perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 6 feet, adorned with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers with five reflexed petals, which bloom in late summer. Its most distinctive feature is its large, woody, seed pods that split open to release silky, parachute-like seeds. Decalobanthus mammosus plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
