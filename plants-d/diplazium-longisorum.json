    "intro": "Diplazium longisorum, commonly known as the long-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium longisorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
