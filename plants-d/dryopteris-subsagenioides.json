    "intro": "Dryopteris subsagenioides, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of polypod fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are divided into lance-shaped pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, textured foliage."
