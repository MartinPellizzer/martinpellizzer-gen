    "intro": "Dysoxylum roemeri, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves that are alternately arranged. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in brackish water environments and plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important component of mangrove forests."
