It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and panicle-like inflorescence, which consists of multiple branches bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly textured appearance. The species is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
