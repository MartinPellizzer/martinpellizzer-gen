    "intro": "Dipladenia congesta, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dipladenia congesta is popular as a decorative plant due to its vibrant flowers and ability to climb trellises or walls."
