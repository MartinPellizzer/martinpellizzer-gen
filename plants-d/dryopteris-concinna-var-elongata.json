    "intro": "Dryopteris concinna var. elongata, commonly known as the long-leaf water fern, is a variant of the eastern wood fern. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and soil conditions."
