    "intro": "Draba \u00d7 okamotoi, commonly known as the hybrid rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Draba nemorosa and Draba olympica, characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained soils and rocky habitats. It produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by tiny, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Draba \u00d7 okamotoi is considered a rare and endangered species in certain regions."
