    "intro": "Dryopteris mediterranea var. robusta, commonly known as the Mediterranean wood fern, is a perennial fern native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features fronds that are typically leathery and dark green, with a distinctive, upright growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to adapt to a range of soil conditions."
