    "intro": "Didelta spinosa, commonly known as the spiked didelta, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, bean-like seeds. Didelta spinosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
