    "intro": "Delphinium geraniifolium, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance, which gives the plant its species name \"geraniifolium.\" It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and high-altitude environments. Due to its striking floral display and ecological importance, it is a valued plant in both horticulture and conservation efforts."
