    "intro": "Dendrobium spinuliferum, commonly known as the spike orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in height. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive red or purple lip that attracts pollinators. Dendrobium spinuliferum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
