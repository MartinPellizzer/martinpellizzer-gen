    "intro": "Diaphananthe thomensis, commonly known as the Tom\u00e9nsis orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly Mozambique. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, and red. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them, often found in humid forest environments. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
