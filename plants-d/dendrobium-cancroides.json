    "intro": "Dendrobium cancroides, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, golden-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Dendrobium cancroides is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
