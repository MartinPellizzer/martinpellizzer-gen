    "intro": "Delosperma cooperi, commonly known as ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and orange, typically blooming in summer. It is drought-tolerant and well-suited for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its low-growing habit and ability to spread via runners make it an effective ground cover."
