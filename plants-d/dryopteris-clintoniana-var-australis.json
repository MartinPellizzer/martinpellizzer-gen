    "intro": "Dryopteris clintoniana var. australis, commonly known as the Southern Shield Fern, is a variant of the Clintonia fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its robust, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces fertile fronds with sporangia clustered in sori, typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
