    "intro": "Dichanthelium lanuginosum var. villosissimum, commonly known as the silky hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its finely hairy leaves, which give it a soft, silky appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous and wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting various insect and bird life."
