    "intro": "Diospyros pustulata, commonly known as the rough-leaved persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, rough, and often hairy leaves, which are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, round, orange-red berries. The fruit is edible when fully ripe, though it can be astringent when unripe. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological importance."
