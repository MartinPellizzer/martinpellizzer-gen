    "intro": "Draconia pannosa, commonly known as the woolly dragon's beard, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts."
