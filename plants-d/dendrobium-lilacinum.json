    "intro": "Dendrobium lilacinum, commonly known as the lilac orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep lilac, often with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Dendrobium lilacinum is valued both for its ornamental beauty and for its role in traditional medicine."
