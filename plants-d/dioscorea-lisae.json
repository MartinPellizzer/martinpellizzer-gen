    "intro": "Dioscorea lisae, commonly known as the Mexican yam, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend support structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its tuberous roots are the primary part used, though they are not as widely cultivated as other yam species. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
