    "intro": "Digitaria exasperata, commonly known as the panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, particularly found in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and degraded soils. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions and is drought-tolerant. Digitaria exasperata is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
