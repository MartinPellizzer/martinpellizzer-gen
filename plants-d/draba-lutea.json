    "intro": "Draba lutea, commonly known as the yellow whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that release seeds by wind. Draba lutea is generally a short-lived perennial, with a low-growing habit and hairy stems."
