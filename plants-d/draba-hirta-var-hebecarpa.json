    "intro": "Draba hirta var. hebecarpa, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, linear leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowers are borne on slender, leafless stems and are often clustered in umbels. The species is notable for its ability to survive in harsh, cold environments and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for its hardiness and ornamental value."
