    "intro": "Dimorphorchis beccarii, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features two distinct kinds of flowers on the same plant. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has rhizomes that help it anchor in the soil. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, attracting various pollinators such as bees and wasps. Due to habitat loss, Dimorphorchis beccarii is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
