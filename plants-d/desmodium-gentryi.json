    "intro": "Desmodium gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces distinctive burrs that aid in seed dispersal, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges and disturbed sites, contributing to soil stabilization through its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
