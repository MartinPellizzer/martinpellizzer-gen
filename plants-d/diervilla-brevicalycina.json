It belongs to the Heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall. Diervilla brevicalycina thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open woods."
