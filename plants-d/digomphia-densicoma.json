    "intro": "Digomphia densicoma, commonly known as the dense-hair lichen, is a unique lichen species characterized by its complex symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. It typically grows on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions, forming a crust-like or foliose structure. The plant's dense, hairy appearance is due to the presence of specialized structures called pseudoparaphyses, which help in water retention and protection. Its morphology varies with environmental conditions, making it an important indicator species for ecological studies. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to pollution, it is often used in assessing the health of forest ecosystems."
