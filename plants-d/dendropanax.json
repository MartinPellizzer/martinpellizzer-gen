    "intro": "Dendropanax, commonly known as the arrow leaf or arrowhead plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves, which are usually palmately lobed and have a glossy surface. Dendropanax species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The plants produce small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by berries that range in color from red to black. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine."
