    "intro": "Doryopteris palmata var. patula, commonly known as the Patula maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family with distinctive, finely divided, leathery fronds. It is native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, shaded woodland environments. The plant features a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures on the underside. Its foliage is dark green and often has a slightly curled appearance, contributing to its ornamental value. This variety is valued in horticulture for its delicate, fern-like structure and ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
