It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The species is of interest in botanical studies for its ecological and potential medicinal properties."
