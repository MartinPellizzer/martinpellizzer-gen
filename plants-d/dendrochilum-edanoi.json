    "intro": "Dendrochilum edanoi, commonly known as the Edanoi tree orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on tree branches in tropical rainforests. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the warmer months. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. The orchid's unique morphology and ornamental flowers make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
