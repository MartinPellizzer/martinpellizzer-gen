    "intro": "Doryopteris branneri, commonly known as the Branner's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are typically divided into shield-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Doryopteris branneri plays an important ecological role in maintaining forest biodiversity and soil stability."
