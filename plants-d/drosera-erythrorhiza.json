    "intro": "Drosera erythrorhiza, commonly known as the red-rooted sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically reddish in color, which helps in absorbing sunlight for photosynthesis. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Drosera erythrorhiza is a perennial species that can survive in harsh conditions by storing nutrients in its fleshy roots."
