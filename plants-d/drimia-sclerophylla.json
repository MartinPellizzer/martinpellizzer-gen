    "intro": "Drimia sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved dragon's tongue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers during the spring and early summer. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Drimia sclerophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage and flowering habit."
