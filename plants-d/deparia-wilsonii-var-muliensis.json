    "intro": "Deparia wilsonii var. muliensis, commonly known as the Muliensis shield fern, is a variant of the Wilson's shield fern native to specific regions in China. It is a fern characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, lanceolate segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forests with high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
