It is a perennial species characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its delicate structure and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
