    "intro": "Disterigma alaternoides, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a small, slow-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers that are often clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its latex sap is toxic and has been used traditionally for various purposes, though it requires caution. Disterigma alaternoides is well adapted to dry environments and can thrive in rocky soils with minimal water."
