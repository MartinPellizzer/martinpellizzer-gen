It belongs to the genus Dioscorea, which includes over 600 species of yams, many of which are cultivated for their starchy tubers. The plant produces large, fleshy tubers that can reach several kilograms in weight, with a skin that is typically pale yellow to brown in color. Its leaves are heart-shaped and can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter, while its stems are climbing and often covered in soft, hairy hairs. The plant is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments and plays an important role in the local ecosystems of Southeast Asia."
