    "intro": "Dryopteris juruensis, commonly known as the Juruense Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, shield-like shape that gives the species its common name."
