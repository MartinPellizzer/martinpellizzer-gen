    "intro": "Damrongia cyanea, commonly known as the blue-flowered orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals and sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are short-lived but highly fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Damrongia cyanea is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
