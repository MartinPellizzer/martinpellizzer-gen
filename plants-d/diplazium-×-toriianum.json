    "intro": "Diplazium \u00d7 toriianum, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Diplazium esculentum and Diplazium soriolosum. It is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered sori on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a thin, membranous indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce spores and is primarily propagated through vegetative means."
