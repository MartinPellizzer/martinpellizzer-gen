    "intro": "Dendrochilum longibulbum, commonly known as the long-bulb orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant features pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, which help it survive in its natural habitat. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Dendrochilum longibulbum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
