It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. This variety is distinguished by its glaucous (bluish-gray) appearance, particularly on its leaves and flower stalks."
