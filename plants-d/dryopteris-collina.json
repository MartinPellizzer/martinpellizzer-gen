    "intro": "Dryopteris collina, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with upright, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are typically grouped in clusters. Dryopteris collina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, evergreen foliage."
