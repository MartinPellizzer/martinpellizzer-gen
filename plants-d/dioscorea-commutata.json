    "intro": "Dioscorea commutata, commonly known as the narrowleaf yam, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend supports. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in clusters. Its tuberous roots are edible when properly prepared and have been used traditionally by Native American communities. Dioscorea commutata is often found in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial shade."
