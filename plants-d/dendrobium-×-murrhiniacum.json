    "intro": "Dendrobium \u00d7 murrhiniacum, commonly known as the golden tip orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like stems and clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive golden tip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated for both horticultural and commercial purposes."
