    "intro": "Dryopteris borreri, commonly known as the California water fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
