It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple during the summer months. It prefers full sun and well-draining soil, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Drosanthemum lique is also known for its ability to tolerate frost, though it may require protection in colder climates."
