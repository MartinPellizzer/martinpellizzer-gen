It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops and weeds. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically blooming before the leaves fully develop. Draba velutina is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates."
