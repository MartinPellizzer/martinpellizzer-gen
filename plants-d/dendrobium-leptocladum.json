    "intro": "Dendrobium leptocladum, commonly known as the slender-branch orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, wiry stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
