    "intro": "Dinochloa indica, commonly known as the Indian spikerush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Dinochloa indica plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
