    "intro": "Dierama ambiguum, commonly known as the variable dierama, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, tall spikes of pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is drought-tolerant and well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. The flowers bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
