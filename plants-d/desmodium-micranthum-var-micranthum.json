    "intro": "Desmodium micranthum var. micranthum, commonly known as small-flowered burr legume, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant features trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pinkish to white flowers. Its seed pods are hairy and often contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. This species is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
