    "intro": "Dryopteris megaphylloides, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern characterized by its large, leathery fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to eastern North America, particularly in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile fronds that produce sporangia on the underside. Its distinctive, broad, and often deeply lobed leaves make it a striking addition to woodland gardens. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
