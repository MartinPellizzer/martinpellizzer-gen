    "intro": "Draco hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's draco, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and striking, spiky inflorescences that resemble the horns of a dragon, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Draco hookeriana is considered a vulnerable species."
