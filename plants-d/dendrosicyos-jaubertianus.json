    "intro": "Dendrosicyos jaubertianus, commonly known as the giant rat-tail cactus, is a unique succulent native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 10 meters in length, resembling a rat's tail. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at the tips of the stems, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
