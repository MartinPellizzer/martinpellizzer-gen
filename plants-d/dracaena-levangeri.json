    "intro": "Dracaena levangeri, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that display alternating light and dark green stripes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red berries, though these are not typically harvested for consumption. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to maintain its health and vibrant foliage. Dracaena levangeri is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
