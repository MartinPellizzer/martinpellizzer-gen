It consists of several species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. The plants are shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their compact growth and bright yellow flowers. Deeringia species are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms. They are adapted to dry climates and can thrive with minimal water once established."
