    "intro": "Diplazium moluccanum, commonly known as the Moluccan shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, erect rhizome and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The fronds are bi-pinnate, with closely spaced, lanceolate pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
