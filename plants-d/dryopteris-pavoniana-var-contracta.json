    "intro": "Dryopteris pavoniana var. contracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family with distinctive, finely divided, dark green fronds. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Gulf Coast, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a compact, upright growth habit with rhizomatous stems that produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Its fronds are characterized by their narrow, leathery texture and a subtle, elegant appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. This fern is well adapted to humid climates and requires consistent moisture and partial to full shade for optimal growth."
