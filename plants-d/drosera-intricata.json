    "intro": "Drosera intricata, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It features delicate, hairy leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or reddish in color. Drosera intricata is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
