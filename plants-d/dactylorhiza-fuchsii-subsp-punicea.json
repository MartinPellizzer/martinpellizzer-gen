    "intro": "Dactylorhiza fuchsii subsp. punicea, commonly known as the pink marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and damp woodlands. The plant features a slender, hairy stem that bears several oval, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are arranged in a loose spike, with showy, pink or reddish-purple petals that attract pollinators. This subspecies is notable for its striking coloration and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
