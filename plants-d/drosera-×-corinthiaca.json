    "intro": "Drosera \u00d7 corinthiaca, commonly known as the Corinthian sundew, is a hybrid carnivorous plant resulting from the cross between Drosera rotundifolia and Drosera intermedia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its hybrid nature makes it a unique subject in the study of plant evolution and adaptation."
