    "intro": "Dalbergia toroensis, commonly known as the Toro rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central America, particularly found in countries like Guatemala and Honduras. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, reddish-brown color. The plant has compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It is also known for its fragrant bark and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
