    "intro": "Delissea coriacea var. gratiosa, commonly known as the silky delissea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically a deep green with a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive, almost velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are often visited by pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to maintain a compact, bushy form."
