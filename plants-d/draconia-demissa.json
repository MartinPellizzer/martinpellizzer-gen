    "intro": "Draconia demissa, commonly known as the dwarf dragon's tongue, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of purple or pink, which are usually hidden among the foliage. Its succulent nature allows it to thrive in arid environments, making it well-adapted to rocky soils and high altitudes. Draconia demissa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
