    "intro": "Dryopteris rivulariformis, commonly known as the riverbank shield fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long and have a finely divided, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks, forests, and wetlands. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or sandy substrates. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
