    "intro": "Dryopteris anomala, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bright green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, compact structures called sori. Dryopteris anomala is a perennial plant that thrives in cool, humid climates and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
