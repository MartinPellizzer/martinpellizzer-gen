It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods containing small, edible seeds. It is often used in agricultural systems for its nitrogen-fixing abilities and as a forage crop. Desmodium aikinianum thrives in well-drained soils and is tolerant to drought conditions."
