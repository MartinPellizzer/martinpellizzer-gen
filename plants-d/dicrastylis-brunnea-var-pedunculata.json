It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, often hairy foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, pendulous clusters. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
