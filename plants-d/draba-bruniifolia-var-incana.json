    "intro": "Draba bruniifolia var. incana, commonly known as the silverleaf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
