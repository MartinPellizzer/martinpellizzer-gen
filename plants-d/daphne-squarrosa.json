    "intro": "Daphne squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually gray-green in color and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and gray, often exfoliating to reveal a reddish inner layer. Daphne squarrosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and winter interest."
