    "intro": "Doryopteris stieri, commonly known as the Stier's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Doryopteris stieri is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
