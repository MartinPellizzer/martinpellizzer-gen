    "intro": "Desmodium elegans f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered velvetbean, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has a creeping growth habit with hairy stems and produces small, round pods that contain several seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in soil conservation due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
