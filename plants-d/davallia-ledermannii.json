    "intro": "Davallia ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, clumping growth habit and its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Davallia ledermannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
