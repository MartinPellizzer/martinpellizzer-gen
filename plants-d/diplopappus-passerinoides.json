    "intro": "Diplopappus passerinoides, commonly known as the red sand rat's tail, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its seeds are enclosed in a hairy, two-part capsule that aids in wind dispersal. The species is adapted to arid environments and is often found in grassland and shrubland habitats."
