    "intro": "Donax gracilis, commonly known as the slender glassworts, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant has succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in harsh, dry conditions. Its small, green flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Donax gracilis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local wildlife."
