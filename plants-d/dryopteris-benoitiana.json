    "intro": "Dryopteris benoitiana, commonly known as the Benoit's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive, finely divided, feather-like structure. The fronds are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it thrive in shaded, moist environments. This fern prefers cool, humid conditions and is often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
