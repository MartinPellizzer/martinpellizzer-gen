    "intro": "Daphne arbuscula var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth daphne, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, aromatic foliage with small, rounded leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, usually blooming in late winter or early spring. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, though it is relatively drought tolerant once established."
