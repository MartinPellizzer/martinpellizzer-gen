    "intro": "Dactylis ibizensis, commonly known as the Ibiza grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
