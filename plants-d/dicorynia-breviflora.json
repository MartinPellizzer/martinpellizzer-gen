    "intro": "Dicorynia breviflora, commonly known as the Brazilian walnut, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its large, smooth, gray bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single large seed. Its seeds are valued for their high oil content and are used in traditional medicine and as a source of edible oil. The tree is also important in ecological restoration due to its ability to thrive in degraded soils."
