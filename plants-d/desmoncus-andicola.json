    "intro": "Desmoncus andicola, commonly known as the Andean dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It typically grows in rocky and humus-rich soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and specialized root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
