    "intro": "Diplazium longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or near streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense mats, contributing to its ability to colonize wetlands and rocky areas. The spores are released from specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
