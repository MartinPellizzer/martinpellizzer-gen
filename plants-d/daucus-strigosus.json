    "intro": "Daucus strigosus, commonly known as the hairy parsley or wild carrot, is a biennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in umbels. Its roots are typically slender and fibrous, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in meadows. Daucus strigosus is considered a weed in agricultural settings but has some historical use in traditional medicine."
