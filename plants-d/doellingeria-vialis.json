    "intro": "Doellingeria vialis, commonly known as the common marsh grass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in wetland habitats. Doellingeria vialis plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
