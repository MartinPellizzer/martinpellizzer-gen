    "intro": "Ditassa micromeria, commonly known as the small-leaved ditassa, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its small, narrow leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow and produce small seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
