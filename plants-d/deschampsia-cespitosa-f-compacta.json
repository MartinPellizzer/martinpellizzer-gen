    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa f. compacta, commonly known as compact tuftgrass, is a compact, low-growing grass species native to North America. It forms dense, mat-like clumps with fine, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. This form is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
