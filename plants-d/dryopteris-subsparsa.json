    "intro": "Dryopteris subsparsa, commonly known as the sparse fern or the Japanese forest fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
