    "intro": "Dryopteris baronii, commonly known as the Baron's wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering. Dryopteris baronii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens."
