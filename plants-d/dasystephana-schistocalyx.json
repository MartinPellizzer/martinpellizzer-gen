    "intro": "Dasystephana schistocalyx, commonly known as the rock fig, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry regions."
