    "intro": "Duvernoia maxima, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its flowers, which are typically white or pink, bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The species is notable for its ability to float on the water's surface while maintaining a submerged root system."
