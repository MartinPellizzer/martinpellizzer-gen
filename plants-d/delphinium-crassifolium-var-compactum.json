    "intro": "Delphinium crassifolium var. compactum, commonly known as the compact delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and tall, spindly stems that bear large, showy blue to purple flowers. The leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is valued in gardens for its vibrant blooms and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
