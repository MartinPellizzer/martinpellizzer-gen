    "intro": "Deyeuxia lapponica, commonly known as the Arctic flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as tundra and mountain meadows. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. Deyeuxia lapponica plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic organisms."
