    "intro": "Diuris eborensis, commonly known as the Borneo spider-orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Borneo. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous stems and clusters of small, intricate flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with reddish-brown markings, and it blooms during the wet season. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
