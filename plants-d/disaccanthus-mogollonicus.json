    "intro": "Disaccanthus mogollonicus, commonly known as the Mogollon dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
