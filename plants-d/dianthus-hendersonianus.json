    "intro": "Dianthus hendersonianus, commonly known as the Henderson's campion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its vibrant pink or red flowers, which bloom in clusters atop slender stems. The plant features basal leaves that are often hairy and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
