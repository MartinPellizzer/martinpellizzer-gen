    "intro": "Dombeya autumnalis, commonly known as autumn dombeya, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its showy, panicle-like clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves with a hairy texture that help reduce water loss in its native climate. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or well-drained soils. Dombeya autumnalis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
