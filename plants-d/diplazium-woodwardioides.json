    "intro": "Diplazium woodwardioides, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors, where it can thrive in low light conditions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with lanceolate pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. Diplazium woodwardioides is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small organisms."
