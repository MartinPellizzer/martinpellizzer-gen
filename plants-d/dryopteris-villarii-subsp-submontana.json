    "intro": "Dryopteris villarii subsp. submontana, commonly known as the subalpine wood fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in forested areas with well-drained, acidic soils. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. This subspecies is well adapted to high-altitude conditions, showcasing its resilience in harsh, temperate climates."
