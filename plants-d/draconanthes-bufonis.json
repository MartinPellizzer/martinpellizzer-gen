    "intro": "Draconanthes bufonis, commonly known as the snake orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant produces striking, colorful flowers that resemble the patterns of a snake's skin, which is believed to be an evolutionary adaptation for attracting specific pollinators. Draconanthes bufonis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
