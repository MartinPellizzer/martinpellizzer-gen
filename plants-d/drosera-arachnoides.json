    "intro": "Drosera arachnoides, commonly known as the spider-silk sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are often small and clustered, with a dense covering of red or orange secretory glands. Drosera arachnoides is a perennial species that thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded habitats."
