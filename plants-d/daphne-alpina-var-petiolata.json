    "intro": "Daphne alpina var. petiolata, commonly known as the Alpine Daphne, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage with thick, leathery leaves that are often pubescent underneath. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or pale purple during late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
