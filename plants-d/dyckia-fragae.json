    "intro": "Dyckia fragae, commonly known as the fragrant dyckia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a compact, water-holding structure. The leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. It produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. This plant is well adapted to dry environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
