    "intro": "Dryopteris bipinnata, commonly known as the two-pinnate wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are typically divided into two levels of pinnae, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
