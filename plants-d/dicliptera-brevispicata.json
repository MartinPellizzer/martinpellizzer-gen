It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant features slender, erect stems with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, which produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Dicliptera brevispicata is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some traditional practices for its fibrous material."
