    "intro": "Dendrobium atjehense, commonly known as the Atjeh orchid, is a species of orchid native to the island of Sumatra in Indonesia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight. Dendrobium atjehense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
