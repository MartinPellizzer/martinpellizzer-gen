    "intro": "Draba kananaskis, commonly known as the Kananaskis wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Alberta, Canada. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and low-growing habit. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing bright yellow or white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in its harsh, cold environment. Draba kananaskis is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability in its habitat."
