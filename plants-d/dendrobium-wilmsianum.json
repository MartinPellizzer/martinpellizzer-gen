    "intro": "Dendrobium wilmsianum, commonly known as the Wilmsian orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like stems that often branch and bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat with minimal soil. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with intricate patterns, and they bloom during the warmer months. Dendrobium wilmsianum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various growing conditions."
