    "intro": "Draba mollissima, commonly known as the silky whitlow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has smooth, hairless leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Draba mollissima is often found in tundra and mountainous areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
