    "intro": "Deparia abbreviata, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, triangular-shaped fronds that are often divided into numerous segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The plant's rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new growth."
