It features a tall, cane-like stem with a sympodial growth habit, often reaching several meters in height. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow and orange, during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
