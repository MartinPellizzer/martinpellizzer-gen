    "intro": "Dichaea eburnea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like stems and small, white, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are often hidden within the mossy canopy of its host trees. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a specific balance of light and moisture to survive. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Dichaea eburnea is considered a conservation concern."
