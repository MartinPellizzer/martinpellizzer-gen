    "intro": "Daphne composita var. montana, commonly known as the mountain daphne, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its winter interest, as the foliage remains attractive throughout the colder months."
