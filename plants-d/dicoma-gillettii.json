    "intro": "Dicoma gillettii, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in winter, providing nectar for pollinators during cooler months. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to withstand coastal conditions and salt spray. Dicoma gillettii is often used in ornamental gardening for its hardy nature and attractive, frost-resistant appearance."
