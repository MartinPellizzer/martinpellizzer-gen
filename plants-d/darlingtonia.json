    "intro": "Darlingtonia, commonly known as the cobra lily, is a genus of carnivorous plants native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its unique, tubular leaf structure that forms a pitfall trap to capture prey. The plant's leaves are often brightly colored, with vivid red and green hues that help attract insects. Darlingtonia species thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in bogs and forested areas. Its specialized morphology and ecological role make it an intriguing subject in botanical studies."
