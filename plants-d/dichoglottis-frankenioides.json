    "intro": "Dichoglottis frankenioides, commonly known as the New Zealand swamp taro, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in wetland environments. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats and is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in its natural habitat."
