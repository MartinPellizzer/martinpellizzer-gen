    "intro": "Donnellsmithia tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, tuberous roots that store nutrients and water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces delicate, showy flowers with intricate patterns and a strong, often spicy fragrance. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to minimize water loss. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
