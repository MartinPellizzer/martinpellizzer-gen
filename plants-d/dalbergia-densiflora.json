It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval to lanceolate in shape. The wood of Dalbergia densiflora is valued for its fine grain and durability, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship."
