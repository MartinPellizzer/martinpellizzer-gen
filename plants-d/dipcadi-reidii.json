    "intro": "Dipcadi reidii, commonly known as the Reed's onion, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the high-altitude grasslands of the Andes. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a cluster of white or pale purple flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
