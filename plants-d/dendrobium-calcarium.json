    "intro": "Dendrobium calcarium, commonly known as the stone orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy roots and upright, branching stems that often bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to grow on rocky or forested substrates. Its unique morphology includes a calcified stem base, which gives it its name, and it is often found in humid tropical climates. Dendrobium calcarium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
