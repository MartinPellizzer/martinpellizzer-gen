    "intro": "Dryopteris filix-mas subsp. borreri, commonly known as the Borreri Shield Fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
