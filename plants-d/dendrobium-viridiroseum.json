    "intro": "Dendrobium viridiroseum, commonly known as the green-veined orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple stems that produce clusters of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has fleshy, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and fragrance, it is a popular choice for both horticultural collections and botanical research."
