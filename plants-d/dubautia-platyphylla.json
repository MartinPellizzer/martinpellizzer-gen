    "intro": "Dubautia platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf Dubautia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, pale yellow to orange flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to invasive species, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
