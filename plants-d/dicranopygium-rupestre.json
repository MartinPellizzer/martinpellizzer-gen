    "intro": "Dicranopygium rupestre, commonly known as the rock moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort found in rocky or arid environments. It belongs to the family Dicranaceae and is characterized by its small, dense growth habit and intricate leaf structure. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained substrates, often on limestone or sandstone. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the leafy thallus, typical of many liverworts. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental stability."
