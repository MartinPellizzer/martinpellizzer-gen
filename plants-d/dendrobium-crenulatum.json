    "intro": "Dendrobium crenulatum, commonly known as the wavy-leaf dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that bear numerous lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with a speckled or mottled pattern. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium crenulatum is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
