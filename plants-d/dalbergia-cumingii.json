    "intro": "Dalbergia cumingii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and functional properties. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its valuable timber, it is also subject to overharvesting and conservation concerns."
