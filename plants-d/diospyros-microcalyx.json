    "intro": "Diospyros microcalyx, commonly known as the small-fruited persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20135 meters and has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by small, round, fleshy fruits that are usually red or orange when ripe. The fruits are edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other persimmon species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests or along riverbanks."
