    "intro": "Dumasia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy dumasia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is known for its hairy leaves and stems, which give it its common name. Dumasia pubescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in cooler climates. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
