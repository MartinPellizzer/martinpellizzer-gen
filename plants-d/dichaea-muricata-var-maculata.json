    "intro": "Dichaea muricata var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted flame orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers with a distinctive red or orange blotch on each petal, giving it its common name. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
