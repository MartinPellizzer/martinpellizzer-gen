    "intro": "Dendrobium masonii, commonly known as the Mason's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks rather than in soil. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and white, often with a slight pink or red hue. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with periods of drought. Dendrobium masonii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
