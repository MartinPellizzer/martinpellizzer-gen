    "intro": "Dillenia floribunda, commonly known as the golden dillenia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its fruit is a woody, spiky capsule that splits open to release seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The botanical features of Dillenia floribunda make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
