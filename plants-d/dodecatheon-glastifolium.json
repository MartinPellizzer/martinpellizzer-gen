It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are elongated and have a distinctive waxy texture, while its stems are covered in fine hairs. Dodecatheon glastifolium plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in conservation areas due to its declining population."
