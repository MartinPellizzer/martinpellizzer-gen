    "intro": "Drosera ramentacea var. glabripes, commonly known as the glabrous sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swampy areas. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually pink or red in color. This variety is notable for its reduced hair coverage compared to other Drosera species, giving it a smoother appearance."
