    "intro": "Dactylorhiza maculata subsp. islandica, commonly known as the Island Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the British Isles and parts of northern Europe. It typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and heaths. The plant has a slender, often branched rhizome and produces tall, erect stems with several lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pale green to yellowish with dark purple markings, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This subspecies is relatively rare and is protected in some regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
