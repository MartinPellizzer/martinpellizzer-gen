    "intro": "Dodecatheon alpinum f. nanum, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces capsules as its fruit. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
