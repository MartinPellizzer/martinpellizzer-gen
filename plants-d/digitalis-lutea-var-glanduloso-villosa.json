    "intro": "Digitalis lutea var. glanduloso-villosa, commonly known as the sticky yellow foxglove, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features lance-shaped leaves that are glandular and covered in fine, sticky hairs, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces tall flowering stems with clusters of bell-shaped, yellowish-orange flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees, due to their color and nectar production."
