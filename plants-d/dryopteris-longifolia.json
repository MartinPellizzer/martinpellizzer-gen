    "intro": "Dryopteris longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors, where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Dryopteris longifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
