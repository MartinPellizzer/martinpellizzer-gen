    "intro": "Dracaena gracilis, commonly known as the slender dracaena, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a slight yellowish tinge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena gracilis is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
