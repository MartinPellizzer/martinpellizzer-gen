    "intro": "Drosera anglica, commonly known as the English sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sugary substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped and can vary in color from green to reddish depending on light exposure. Drosera anglica is known for its ability to digest trapped prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils."
