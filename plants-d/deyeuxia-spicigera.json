It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, blade-like leaves that are often hairless. Its inflorescence is a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lipped flowers, which are typically greenish or brownish in color.
