It is characterized by its vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It grows in a variety of habitats, including meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and is known for its hardy nature.
