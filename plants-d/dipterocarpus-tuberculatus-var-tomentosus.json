    "intro": "Dipterocarpus tuberculatus var. tomentosus, commonly known as the hairy dipterocarp, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark and smooth, pale grey to brown trunk. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing one or two seeds. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and plays an important role in the ecological systems of its native habitats."
