It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Deppia mexicana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for its unique flowering pattern."
