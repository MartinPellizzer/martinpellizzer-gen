    "intro": "Diplazium lindbergii var. subnuda, commonly known as the naked fern, is a variant of the Diplazium genus native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial fern characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in forest undergrowth where it plays a role in soil stabilization and biodiversity."
