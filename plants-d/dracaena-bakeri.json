It is native to parts of Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically bright green. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red or orange berries, which are edible for some bird species. Dracaena bakeri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
