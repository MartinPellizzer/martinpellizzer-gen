    "intro": "Diodia auriculosa, commonly known as silverleaf diodia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb with hairy, succulent leaves that often have a silvery or grayish hue due to the presence of fine trichomes. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. Diodia auriculosa is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered an indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
