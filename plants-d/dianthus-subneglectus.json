    "intro": "Dianthus subneglectus, commonly known as the neglected carnation, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of showy, pink or white flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
