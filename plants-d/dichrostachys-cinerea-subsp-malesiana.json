    "intro": "Dichrostachys cinerea subsp. malesiana, commonly known as the African burr bush, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, followed by distinctive, three-lobed pods that enclose the seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. The species is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
