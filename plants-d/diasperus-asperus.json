    "intro": "Diasperus asperus, commonly known as the rough leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, this plant is well adapted to dry environments with poor soil conditions. It often grows in rocky or sandy soils and is found in regions such as southern Africa and parts of the Middle East. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in drought-tolerant gardens."
