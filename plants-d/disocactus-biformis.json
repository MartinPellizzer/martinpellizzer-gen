    "intro": "Disocactus biformis, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a fascinating cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, flattened, ribbed stems that resemble the shape of a ghost, hence its common name. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and low maintenance requirements, it is well-suited for arid environments and container gardening."
