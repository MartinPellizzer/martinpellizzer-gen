    "intro": "Diplopappus prunelloides, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or arid habitats. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pollinator attractant and a valuable plant for xeriscaping."
