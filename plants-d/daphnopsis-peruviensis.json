    "intro": "Daphnopsis peruviensis, commonly known as the Peruvian daphnopsis, is a member of the Ericaceae family, native to the Andean regions of Peru. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, leathery berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
