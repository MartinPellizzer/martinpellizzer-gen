    "intro": "Dictyoloma vandellianum, commonly known as the Vandellian's nettle, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its stinging hairs, it can be a common but potentially irritating plant in its native habitat."
