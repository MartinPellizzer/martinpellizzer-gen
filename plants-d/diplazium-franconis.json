    "intro": "Diplazium franconis, commonly known as the Franconian water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in water absorption. Diplazium franconis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
