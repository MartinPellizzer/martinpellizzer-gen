    "intro": "Dactylophyllum fragaria, commonly known as the strawberry tree, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a bland taste. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. The strawberry tree is also notable for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
