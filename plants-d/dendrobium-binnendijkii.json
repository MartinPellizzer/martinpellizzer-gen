    "intro": "Dendrobium binnendijkii, commonly known as the Binnendijk's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and often covered in a dense layer of white or brown velvety hair. Dendrobium binnendijkii is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
