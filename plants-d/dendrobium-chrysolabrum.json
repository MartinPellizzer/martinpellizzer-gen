    "intro": "Dendrobium chrysolabrum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are highly fragrant and attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapting to the humid, shaded environments where it grows. Dendrobium chrysolabrum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
