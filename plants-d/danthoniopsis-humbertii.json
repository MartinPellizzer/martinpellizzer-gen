    "intro": "Danthoniopsis humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's danthonia, is a species of grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or inland regions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
