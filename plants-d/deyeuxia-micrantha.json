    "intro": "Deyeuxia micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant is often found in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds. Deyeuxia micrantha has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
