    "intro": "Davallia hemiptera, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, thick rhizome that supports its upright growth habit. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil. Its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
