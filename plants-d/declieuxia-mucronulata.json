    "intro": "Declieuxia mucronulata, commonly known as the Cape golden grass, is a perennial grass species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow to golden-green foliage, which is both ornamental and drought-tolerant. The plant typically grows in dense clumps, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in panicles, which are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. Declieuxia mucronulata is well-suited for xeriscaping and is valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions with minimal water requirements."
