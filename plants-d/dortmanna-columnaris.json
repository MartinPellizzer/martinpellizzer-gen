    "intro": "Dortmanna columnaris, commonly known as the columnar saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its upright, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and arranged in a rosette pattern near the base. Dortmanna columnaris thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons."
