    "intro": "Draba borealis f. hebecarpa, commonly known as the Arctic mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The flowers, which are white or pale yellow, bloom in early summer and are pollinated by insects."
