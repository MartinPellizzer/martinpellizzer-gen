It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a buttressed trunk, typical of many tropical species. Its fruits are woody capsules that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its timber and ecological role."
