    "intro": "Dictyoneura integerrima, commonly known as the Australian tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of fronds that form a dense, umbrella-like shape, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The trunk is composed of a mass of rhizomes and roots, which help anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil."
