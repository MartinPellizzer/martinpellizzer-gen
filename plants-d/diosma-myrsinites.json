    "intro": "Diosma myrsinites, commonly known as the silverleaf diosma, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it an attractive and drought-tolerant addition to native plant collections."
