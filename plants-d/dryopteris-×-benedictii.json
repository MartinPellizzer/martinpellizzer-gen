    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 benedictii, commonly known as the Benedict's wood fern, is a hybrid fern that results from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octomaculata. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed, and often bi-colored fronds that display a striking combination of green and brown hues. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its fronds typically unfurl in a compact, curled manner before spreading out, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
