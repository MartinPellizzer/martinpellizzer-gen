    "intro": "Dennstaedtia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fleshy, creeping stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors and along stream banks."
