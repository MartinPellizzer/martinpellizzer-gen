    "intro": "Delphinium peregrinum var. medium, commonly known as the medium blue delphinium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that are covered in a fine layer of down. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a parent species in the development of many modern delphinium hybrids."
