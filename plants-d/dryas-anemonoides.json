    "intro": "Dryas anemonoides, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, resembling those of an anemone. Dryas anemonoides thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
