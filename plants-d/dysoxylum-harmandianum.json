    "intro": "Dysoxylum harmandianum, commonly known as the Harmand's dysoxylum, is a tropical tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often fissured bark and elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland evergreen forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
