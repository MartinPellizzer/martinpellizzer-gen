    "intro": "Dalbergia forbesii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its fine grain and workability. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by elongated pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
