    "intro": "Diplostephium callaense, commonly known as the Mexican arrowroot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the family Marantaceae and is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or silver markings. The plant produces clusters of small, white, flower-like structures called spadices, which are actually modified leaves known as bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Diplostephium callaense is also valued for its starchy roots, which have been used in traditional culinary practices."
