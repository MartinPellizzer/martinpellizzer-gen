It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as cypsela. Dyssodia palmeri is often found in scrublands and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
