It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue and purple trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, often reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a smooth texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution in its native habitat."
