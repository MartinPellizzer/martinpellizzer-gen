    "intro": "Danthonia rufa, commonly known as the red hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves that are typically reddish in color, giving it its common name. The plant grows in dense tussocks and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Danthonia rufa is adapted to dry, arid environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
