    "intro": "Dracaena gemma, commonly known as the dwarf dracaena, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to bright indirect light. Dracaena gemma is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to tolerate a range of indoor conditions."
