    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa subsp. sukatschewii, commonly known as Sukatschew's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its dense, carpet-like growth habit. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the more widely distributed Deschampsia cespitosa."
