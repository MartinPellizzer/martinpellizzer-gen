    "intro": "Dracophyllum victorianum, commonly known as the Victorian draco or Victorian heath, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the wet heathlands of Victoria, Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers during late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically glossy and dark green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its moist, acidic soil habitat. Dracophyllum victorianum is well adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its native environment and is often found in open, wind-exposed areas."
