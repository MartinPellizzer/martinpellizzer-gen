It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to elongated, bean-like pods. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the Dolichos genus."
