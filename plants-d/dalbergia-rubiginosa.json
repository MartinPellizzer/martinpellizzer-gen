    "intro": "Dalbergia rubiginosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its density and fine grain. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in raceme clusters. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in humid, tropical climates. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
