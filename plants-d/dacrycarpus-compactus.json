It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody cones that release seeds. It typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. This species plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's native forests and coastal ecosystems."
