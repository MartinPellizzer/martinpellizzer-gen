    "intro": "Dendrobium goldfinchii, commonly known as the goldfinch orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white or pale green hair. Its flowers are typically small, fragrant, and come in a range of colors including white, yellow, and pink. Dendrobium goldfinchii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions."
