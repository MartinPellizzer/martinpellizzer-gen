    "intro": "Dendrobium nageswarayanum, commonly known as the Nageswarayanum orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its erect, leafy stems and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its flowers bloom during the monsoon season, adding to its ecological significance in the region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
