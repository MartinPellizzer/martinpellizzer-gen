    "intro": "Draba patens, commonly known as the creeping whitlowgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has basal leaves that are usually woolly or hairy, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sun-exposed areas. Draba patens plays an important role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude and polar ecosystems."
