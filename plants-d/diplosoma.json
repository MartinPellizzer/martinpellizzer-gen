    "intro": "Diplosoma, commonly known as the double-bodied sea cucumber, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the phylum Echinodermata. It is characterized by its unique body structure, which consists of two distinct segments that can be separated and later regenerated. The plant lacks true roots, stems, or leaves, and instead relies on its specialized respiratory tree for gas exchange. Diplosoma thrives in shallow coastal waters and is often found in sandy or muddy substrates. Its reproductive system involves the release of eggs and sperm into the water column, contributing to its ecological role in marine ecosystems."
