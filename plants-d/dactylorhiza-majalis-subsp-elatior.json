    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis subsp. elatior, commonly known as the greater marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring a single, upright stem with several oval, dark green leaves. The plant produces a spike of showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, three-lobed lip. It blooms from April to June and is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils. This orchid is often found in still or slow-moving water bodies and is an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
