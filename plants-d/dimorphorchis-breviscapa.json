    "intro": "Dimorphorchis breviscapa, commonly known as the short-caped orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and unique floral structure, featuring a short, narrow floral tube. The plant produces pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive hood-like lip, which is a key feature in its classification. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
