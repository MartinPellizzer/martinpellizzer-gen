    "intro": "Dryandra tortifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dryandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Proteaceae. It is native to Western Australia and is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure with narrow, leathery leaves. The plant produces striking, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
