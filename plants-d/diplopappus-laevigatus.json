    "intro": "Diplopappus laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth burrweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called achenes, which are often covered in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically smooth and alternate, with a slightly hairy underside. The species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive plant in some regions."
