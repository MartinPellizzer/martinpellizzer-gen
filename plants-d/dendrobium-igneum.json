    "intro": "Dendrobium igneum, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking red and orange flowers that bloom in summer, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in varying environmental conditions. Dendrobium igneum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
