    "intro": "Dischidia milnei, commonly known as the hanging basket vine, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Dischidia milnei is also noted for its ability to root at the nodes, making it easy to propagate."
