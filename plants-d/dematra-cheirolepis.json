    "intro": "Dematra cheirolepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved dematra, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically greenish-white in color, which are followed by elliptical, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Dematra cheirolepis thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its botanical characteristics make it a subject of interest for botanists studying tropical flora."
