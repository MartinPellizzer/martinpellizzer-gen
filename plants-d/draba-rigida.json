    "intro": "Draba rigida, commonly known as rigid winter cress, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of dark green, fleshy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in late winter or early spring. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its reproductive strategy involves self-fertilization, which helps it thrive in isolated environments. Draba rigida plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing early-season food for pollinators."
