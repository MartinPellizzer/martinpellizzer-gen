    "intro": "Dianthus sibthorpii, commonly known as the Kashmir carnation, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive white or pale pink center. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as farina. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its striking appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ornamental species."
