    "intro": "Dendrobium gouldii var. acutum, commonly known as the acutely tipped dendrobium, is a member of the orchid family and is native to northern Australia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical or subtropical environments. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems that grow horizontally and produce new growth from the base. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a range of colors including white, pink, and yellow. The leaves are long and strap-like, adapted for efficient water absorption in its natural habitat."
