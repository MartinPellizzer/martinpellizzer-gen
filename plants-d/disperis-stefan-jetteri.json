    "intro": "Disperis stefan-jetteri, commonly known as the Stefan-Jetter's orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Tanzania, where it thrives in cool, moist microhabitats. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a unique structure that resembles a spider, a characteristic feature of many Disperis species. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, highlighting its ecological specificity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
