    "intro": "Diporidium vaccinioides var. serratifolium, commonly known as the serrated-leaved bilberry, is a shrub native to the boreal and montane regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants, and thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. The plant features small, oval leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are typically pink or white, clustered in umbels. It produces dark blue berries that are edible and resemble those of the common blueberry. This variety is distinguished by its distinctive leaf morphology and is often found in forested areas with high humidity."
