    "intro": "Diplazium dameriae, commonly known as the broadleaf chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
