    "intro": "Dendrobium zonatum, commonly known as the zoned orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to green with intricate patterns, and it blooms during the dry season. Dendrobium zonatum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
