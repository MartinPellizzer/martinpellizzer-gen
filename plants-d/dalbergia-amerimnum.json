    "intro": "Dalbergia amerimnum, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its beauty and durability. The plant has compound leaves with stipules, and its flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences. It produces legume pods that contain flat, kidney-shaped seeds. Due to its slow growth and high demand, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
