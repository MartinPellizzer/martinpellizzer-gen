    "intro": "Dracocephalum heterophyllum subsp. ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaved dragonhead, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems covered with dense, glandular hairs, and its leaves are lanceolate to ovate in shape, often with serrated margins. The flowers are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in dense spikes, and are characteristic of the Lamiaceae family. The plant produces small, four-lobed nutlets as its fruit, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its aromatic properties in traditional medicine."
