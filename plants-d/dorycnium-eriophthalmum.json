    "intro": "Dorycnium eriophthalmum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sainfoin, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and often forms a dense mat, making it a valuable plant for soil stabilization. Dorycnium eriophthalmum is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil and supports other plant growth."
