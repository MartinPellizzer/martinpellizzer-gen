    "intro": "Dichilus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved dichilus, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
