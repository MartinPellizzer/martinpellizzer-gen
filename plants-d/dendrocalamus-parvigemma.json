It is characterized by its slender, clustered growth habit and relatively short culms, which are typically less than 3 meters in height. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is cultivated for both horticultural and ecological purposes."
