    "intro": "Didymocarpus minutus, commonly known as the small-fruited sand mat, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its small, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain minute seeds, adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland sandplains. Due to its resilience in harsh environments, it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
