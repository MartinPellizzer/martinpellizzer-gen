    "intro": "Doronicum falconeri, commonly known as the Falconeri's leopard's bane, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in loose clusters. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
