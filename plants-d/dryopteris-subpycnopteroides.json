    "intro": "Dryopteris subpycnopteroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl as they mature. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
