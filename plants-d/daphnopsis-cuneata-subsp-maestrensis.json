It is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with a leathery texture. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible berries. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
