    "intro": "Draba glacialis var. incompta, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant thrives in rocky, alpine environments where it forms dense mats to conserve heat and moisture. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing delicate white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies."
