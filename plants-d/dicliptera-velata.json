    "intro": "Dicliptera velata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has opposite, ovate leaves with a prominent midrib. Its small, white flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits that contain three seeds each. Dicliptera velata is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
