    "intro": "Dryopteris polylepis, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. The fronds are typically divided into segments with a distinctive shield-like shape, contributing to its common name."
