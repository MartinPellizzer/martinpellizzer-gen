    "intro": "Diplazium oligosorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and marshes, where it can anchor itself to submerged or emergent substrates. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, clustered in sori that are often covered by a protective indusium. Diplazium oligosorum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
