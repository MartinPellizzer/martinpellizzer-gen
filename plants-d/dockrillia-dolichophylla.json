    "intro": "Dockrillia dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf dockrillia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species characterized by its elongated, slender leaves. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and some toxic plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
