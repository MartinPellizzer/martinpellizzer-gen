    "intro": "Dryas eriopoda, commonly known as the Arctic draba, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It has a mat-forming growth habit with dense, compact foliage that helps it survive in harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the short growing season. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Dryas eriopoda is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats."
