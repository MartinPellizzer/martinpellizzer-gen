    "intro": "Dasylirion texanum var. aberrans, commonly known as the Texas sotol, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, strap-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, pale blue to purple flowers in the spring. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions. Its drought tolerance and unique appearance make it a notable species in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
