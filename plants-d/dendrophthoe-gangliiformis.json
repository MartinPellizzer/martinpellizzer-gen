    "intro": "Dendrophthoe gangliiformis, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent using its modified leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in dense forests where it can access suitable host trees. Its parasitic nature and unique ecological role make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
