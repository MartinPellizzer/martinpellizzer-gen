    "intro": "Dactylaena ekmanii, commonly known as the KwaZulu-Natal palm, is a rare and endemic species native to South Africa. It is a small, tree-like plant with a single, unbranched stem that can reach up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by small, red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
