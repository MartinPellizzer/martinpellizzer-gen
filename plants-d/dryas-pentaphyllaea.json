    "intro": "Dryas pentaphyllaea, commonly known as the alpine drumstick, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, reducing water loss in cold, dry conditions. Dryas pentaphyllaea is often found in rocky soils and is an indicator species for alpine and tundra ecosystems."
