    "intro": "Daphnopsis dioica, commonly known as the sacred lotus of India, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers that emerge from the water, often with a fragrant aroma. Its reproductive structure includes both male and female flowers, making it a dioecious species. Daphnopsis dioica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
