    "intro": "Dryopteris neolepidopoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly China and Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shady, moist environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
