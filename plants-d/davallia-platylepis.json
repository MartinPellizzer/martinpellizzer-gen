    "intro": "Davallia platylepis, commonly known as the broad-leaf hameglossa, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, leathery, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically bright green and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique foliage and ease of care make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
