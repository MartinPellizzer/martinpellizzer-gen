    "intro": "Desmodium triflorum var. villosum, commonly known as hairy trefoil, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a perennial legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being hairy, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
