    "intro": "Diplazium corderoi, commonly known as the Cordero's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Diplazium corderoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
