    "intro": "Dipcadi palustre, commonly known as the marsh glume, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Amaryllidaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as bogs and damp meadows, across parts of Europe and Asia. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in waterlogged soils, and it is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants. The species is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor environments, making it an indicator of acidic, wet conditions."
