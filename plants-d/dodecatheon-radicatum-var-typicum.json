    "intro": "Dodecatheon radicatum var. typicum, commonly known as the purple trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of broadly ovate, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, showy, purple or pinkish-purple flower with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. Its flowers are typically pollinated by bees and other insects, and the plant relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest understories."
