    "intro": "Dryopteris polypodiformis, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of polypod fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and horticultural collections."
