    "intro": "Dendrobium repandum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant produces long, pendant-like inflorescences with showy, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Dendrobium repandum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
