    "intro": "Dammara macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved dammara, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. The plant is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
