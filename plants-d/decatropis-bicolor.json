    "intro": "Decatropis bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking dichromatic flowers, which display two distinct colors on the same bloom. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without direct exposure. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its humid habitat. Decatropis bicolor is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
