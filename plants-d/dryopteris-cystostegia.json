    "intro": "Dryopteris cystostegia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile and sterile fronds often occurring on separate shoots. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
