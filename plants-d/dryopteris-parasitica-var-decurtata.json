    "intro": "Dryopteris parasitica var. decurtata, commonly known as the decurrent fern, is a variant of the parasitic fern native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring fronds that gradually narrow towards the base, giving it a distinctive decurrent appearance. The plant is hemi-parasitic, deriving some nutrients from its host plants while also performing photosynthesis. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety coating, which helps in moisture retention. This species is typically found in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and stream banks."
