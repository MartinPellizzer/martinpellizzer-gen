    "intro": "Digitaria trinervis, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways. Digitaria trinervis is an important species in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
