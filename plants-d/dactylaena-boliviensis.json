    "intro": "Dactylaena boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically pollinated by wind or insects. The fruit is a fibrous, spiky capsule that contains edible seeds, making it both ecologically and potentially economically significant."
