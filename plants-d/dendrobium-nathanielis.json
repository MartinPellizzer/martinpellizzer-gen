    "intro": "Dendrobium nathanielis, commonly known as the Nathaniel's orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually showy, with a variety of colors including white, yellow, and pink, and they bloom during the warmer months. The plant requires bright, indirect light and well-draining substrates to thrive."
