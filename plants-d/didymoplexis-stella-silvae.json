    "intro": "Didymoplexis stella-silvae, commonly known as the star-silva orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that often display a star-like pattern. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are elongated and leathery, adapted to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. The orchid's unique floral structure and bioluminescent properties make it a subject of both botanical and ecological interest."
