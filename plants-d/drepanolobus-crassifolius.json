    "intro": "Drepanolobus crassifolius, commonly known as the thick-leaved acanthus, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, spiny flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
