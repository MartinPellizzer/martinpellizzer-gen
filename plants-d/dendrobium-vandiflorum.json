    "intro": "Dendrobium vandiflorum, commonly known as the Vandiflorum orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often in clusters. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. Dendrobium vandiflorum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
