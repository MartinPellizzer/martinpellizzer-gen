    "intro": "Dendrobium fuscatum, commonly known as the black root orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features dark-colored roots and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive dark throat. Dendrobium fuscatum is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
