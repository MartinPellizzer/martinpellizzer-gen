    "intro": "Danthonia heteropla, commonly known as the variable danthonia, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and heathlands. Danthonia heteropla is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna."
