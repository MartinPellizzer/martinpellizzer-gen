    "intro": "Dioscorea friesii, commonly known as the African yambean, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and has compound leaves with three to five leaflets. Its tubers are rich in starch and have been traditionally used as a food source, though they require proper preparation to avoid toxicity. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both local ecosystems and traditional practices."
