    "intro": "Didymopanax plurifolius, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich coloration, making it a sought-after material in musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species."
