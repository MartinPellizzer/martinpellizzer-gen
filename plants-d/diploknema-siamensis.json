    "intro": "Diploknema siamensis, commonly known as the Siam ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen leaves that are alternate and elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in panicles, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species."
