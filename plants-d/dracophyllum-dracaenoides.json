    "intro": "Dracophyllum dracaenoides, commonly known as the silverleaf dracaena, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and as a houseplant."
