It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant is adapted to dry environments and often grows in savanna and woodland habitats. It has small, yellow flowers and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil. However, it is not widely cultivated and remains relatively understudied in botanical research."
