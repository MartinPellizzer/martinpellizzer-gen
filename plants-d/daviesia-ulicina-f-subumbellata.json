    "intro": "Daviesia ulicina f. subumbellata, commonly known as the red-flowered Daviesia, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, glandular foliage and striking clusters of bright red or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its floral structure is typical of the Rutaceae family, with small, five-lobed petals. This form is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and denser inflorescences compared to the typical form of Daviesia ulicina."
