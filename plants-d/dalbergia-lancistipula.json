    "intro": "Dalbergia lancistipula, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its beauty and durability. The plant has bipinnate leaves, meaning the leaves are divided into smaller leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several small, flat seeds."
