    "intro": "Diplazium stenocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruit water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium stenocarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
