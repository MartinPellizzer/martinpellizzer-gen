    "intro": "Dactylorhiza praetermissa subsp. osiliensis, commonly known as the Osiliensian marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as bogs, marshes, and fens. The plant has a slender, unbranched stem that bears a few to several flowers, which are usually pale green to yellowish in color. Its leaves are grass-like and often form a rosette at the base of the plant. The species is characterized by its specialized root system, which includes mycorrhizal associations essential for nutrient uptake in its nutrient-poor environments."
