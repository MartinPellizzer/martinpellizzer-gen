    "intro": "Dryopteris francii, commonly known as the French shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland ecosystems."
