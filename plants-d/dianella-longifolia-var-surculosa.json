    "intro": "Dianella longifolia var. surculosa, commonly known as the silver leaf lily, is a striking evergreen perennial native to New Zealand. It features narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are silver-white on the upper surface and dark green underneath, creating a dramatic visual contrast. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by blue-black berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and unique flowering display, though it is not typically used for medicinal purposes."
