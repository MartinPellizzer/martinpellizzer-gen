    "intro": "Descurainia gonzalezii, commonly known as the Mexican tansy, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
