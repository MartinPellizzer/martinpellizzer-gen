    "intro": "Dendrocnide carriana, commonly known as the mountain antler plant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in dense woodland or heathland. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
