It features small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often with a distinctive frilled edge on the petals. The plant has a mat-forming habit, producing numerous stems that spread across the ground, making it ideal for rock gardens or borders. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are evergreen in mild climates. Dianthus prolifer var. diminutus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with full sun."
