    "intro": "Dictamnus albus subvar. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved dictamnus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent, particularly when the stems are broken, due to the presence of volatile oils. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
