    "intro": "Diplazium \u00d7 yaoshanense, commonly known as the Yaoshan sword fern, is a hybrid fern species native to southern China. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped, lanceolate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of foliage. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of fern morphology."
