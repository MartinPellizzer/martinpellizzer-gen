    "intro": "Diplazium polypodioides var. brachylobum, commonly known as the short-lobed water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae, characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams, ponds, or in dense undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This variety is notable for its compact size and adaptability to wetland habitats."
