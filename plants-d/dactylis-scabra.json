    "intro": "Dactylis scabra, commonly known as rough brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its wiry, rough-textured stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Dactylis scabra is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in forage and erosion control."
