    "intro": "Drimophyllum pauciflorum, commonly known as the sparse-flowered drimophyllum, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces few flowers, typically small and pale green, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to specific regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
