    "intro": "Drosera thysanosepala, commonly known as the woolly sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of glandular trichomes that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or reddish in color. Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptations make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
