It belongs to the Droseraceae family and is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette and produce a dense covering of digestive secretions. The inflorescence consists of a cluster of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring."
