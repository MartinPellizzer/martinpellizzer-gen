    "intro": "Dendrobium bronckartii, commonly known as the Bronckart's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients to help it survive in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with bright, indirect light."
