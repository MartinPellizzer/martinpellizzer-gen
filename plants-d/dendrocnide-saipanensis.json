    "intro": "Dendrocnide saipanensis, commonly known as the Saipan stinging nettle, is a flowering plant native to the Mariana Islands. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes many species known for their stinging hairs. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are covered in fine, irritant trichomes. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Despite its common name, it is not a true nettle but is named for its similar appearance and defensive properties."
