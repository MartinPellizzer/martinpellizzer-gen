    "intro": "Daphne papyracia, commonly known as the paperleaf daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pinkish flowers in late spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and showy blooms, though it is toxic to humans and animals."
