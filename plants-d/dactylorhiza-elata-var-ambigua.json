    "intro": "Dactylorhiza elata var. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as bogs, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant features a slender, hairy stem with few leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer. Its roots are often colonized by mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for nutrient uptake. This orchid is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, showcasing its adaptability to challenging environments."
