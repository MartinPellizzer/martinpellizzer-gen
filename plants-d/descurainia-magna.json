    "intro": "Descurainia magna, commonly known as the large leafed tansy, is a flowering plant native to the northwestern United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and pinnately compound leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. It produces small, elongated seed pods that release seeds through a mechanism similar to that of a catapult, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its ecological role and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
