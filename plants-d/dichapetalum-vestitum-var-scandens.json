It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
