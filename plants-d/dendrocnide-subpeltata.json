    "intro": "Dendrocnide subpeltata, commonly known as the stinging tree, is a species of flowering plant native to northern Queensland, Australia. It is a member of the Dendrocnide genus within the family Euphorbiaceae, known for its toxic, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are typically large and ovate. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, often found in rainforest or wetland habitats. The plant's most notable feature is its ability to cause severe skin irritation upon contact, due to the presence of urushiol-like compounds."
