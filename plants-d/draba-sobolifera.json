    "intro": "Draba sobolifera, commonly known as the dwarf whitlow grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the short growing season. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Draba sobolifera is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with distinctive four-petaled flowers."
