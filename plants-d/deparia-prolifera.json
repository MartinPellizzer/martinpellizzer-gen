    "intro": "Deparia prolifera, commonly known as the creeping woodfern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically triangular in cross-section and have a distinctive, somewhat wiry texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to reproduce both sexually through spores and asexually through rhizome fragmentation."
