    "intro": "Distichlis eludens, commonly known as the saltbush or coastal grass, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting glands. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in coastal dunes, salt marshes, and other arid or saline habitats. Due to its resilience, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in harsh environments."
