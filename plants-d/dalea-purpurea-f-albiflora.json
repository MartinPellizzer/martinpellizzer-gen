    "intro": "Dalea purpurea f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The subspecies albiflora is distinguished by its pale to white flowers, in contrast to the typical purple flowers of the main species. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. This plant plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystems."
