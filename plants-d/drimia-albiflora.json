    "intro": "Drimia albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered arum, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a thick, tuberous root system that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, arrow-shaped leaves with a waxy surface, and its flowers are pale white with a spadix surrounded by a spathe. It blooms in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as beetles and moths. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
