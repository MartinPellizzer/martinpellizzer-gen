It features a compact rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in a dense cluster at the top of the stem. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. This subspecies is often found in high-altitude meadows and is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants."
