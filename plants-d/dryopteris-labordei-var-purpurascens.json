    "intro": "Dryopteris labordei var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple frond wood fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that exhibit a striking purplish hue, especially when young. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
