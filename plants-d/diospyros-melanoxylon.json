It is characterized by its dense, dark hardwood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree typically grows as a small to medium-sized evergreen with a rounded crown and smooth, dark bark. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture with a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, sweet fruits that are often consumed by wildlife and humans alike."
