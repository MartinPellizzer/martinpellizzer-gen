    "intro": "Dysoxylum alatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved dysoxylum, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Dysoxylum alatum is typically found in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of tropical flora and ecological systems."
