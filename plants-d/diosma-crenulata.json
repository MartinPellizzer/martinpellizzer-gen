    "intro": "Diosma crenulata, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly wavy margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Diosma crenulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
