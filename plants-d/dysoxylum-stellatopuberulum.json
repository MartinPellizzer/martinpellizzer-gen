    "intro": "Dysoxylum stellatopuberulum, commonly known as the starry-hairy dysoxylum, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves with a hairy texture and a distinctive star-like arrangement of veins. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in traditional medicine."
