    "intro": "Digitaria runyonii, commonly known as Runyon's digitaria, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
