    "intro": "Dicksonia cicutaria var. remota, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a variant of the common tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and feathery fronds that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is a valuable species for ecological studies and conservation efforts."
