    "intro": "Distictella parkeri, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically pale yellow to white in color. Its leaves are succulent, adapted for water storage, and its flowering period usually occurs during the rainy season. Distictella parkeri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
