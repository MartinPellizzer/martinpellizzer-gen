    "intro": "Dioscorea subhastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by tuberous roots that are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it distinct from other yam species, particularly in leaf morphology and growth habit. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
