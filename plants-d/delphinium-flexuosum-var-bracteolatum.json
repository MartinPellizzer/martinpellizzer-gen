    "intro": "Delphinium flexuosum var. bracteolatum, commonly known as the bracteolated larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant produces elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowers are typically arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids that require caution."
