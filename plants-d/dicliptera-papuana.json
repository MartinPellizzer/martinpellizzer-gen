    "intro": "Dicliptera papuana, commonly known as the Papuan dicliptera, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute florets, which are often clustered in dense, cylindrical clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Dicliptera papuana is often found in lowland forests and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
