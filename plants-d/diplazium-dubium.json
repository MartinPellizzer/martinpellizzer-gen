    "intro": "Diplazium dubium, commonly known as the slender chain fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that grow in a compact, upright habit. The plant has a rhizomatous growth system, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. Diplazium dubium is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in the undergrowth of forests where it contributes to the biodiversity of the understory."
