    "intro": "Dendrotrophe amorpha, commonly known as the yellow poplar or catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 5-9 cm in length and have a distinctive veining pattern. The tree produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are pale yellow and appear in clusters during the spring. Its fruit is a long, bean-like pod that splits open to release seeds in the fall. Dendrotrophe amorpha is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
