    "intro": "Draba thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's whitlow grass, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Draba thomsonii is also known for its ability to survive in cold climates and is often found at elevations above 6,000 feet."
