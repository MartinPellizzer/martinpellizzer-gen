    "intro": "Dendrobium rorulentum, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its natural habitat. Dendrobium rorulentum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
