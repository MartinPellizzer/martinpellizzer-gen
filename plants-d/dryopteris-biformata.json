    "intro": "Dryopteris biformata, commonly known as the two-lobed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into two lobes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are released from sori that are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds. Dryopteris biformata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
