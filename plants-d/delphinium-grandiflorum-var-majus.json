    "intro": "Delphinium grandiflorum var. majus, commonly known as the common larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and cottage gardens. However, it is toxic to livestock and humans, so caution is advised when handling or planting it."
