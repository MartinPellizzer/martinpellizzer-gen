    "intro": "Davallia tasmanica, commonly known as the Tasmanian fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Tasmania and southern Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a subtle metallic sheen. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rock crevices or under forest canopy. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth."
