    "intro": "Decussocarpus comptonii, commonly known as the Compton's decussocarpus, is a flowering plant native to the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and related shrubs. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically evergreen, leathery, and arranged in a distinctive decussate pattern, meaning they are crossed at right angles. This species is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats."
