    "intro": "Dichoglottis bellidifolia, commonly known as the golden arrow plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the wet lowlands of New Guinea. It features striking, elongated leaves that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen, often adorned with prominent veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
