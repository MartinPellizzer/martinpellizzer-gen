    "intro": "Deschampsia biebersteiniana, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Its flowering spikes produce delicate, pale green to brownish flowers that are clustered in loose panicles. Deschampsia biebersteiniana plays an important role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous habitats and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
