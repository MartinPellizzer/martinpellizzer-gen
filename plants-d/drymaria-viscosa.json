    "intro": "Drymaria viscosa, commonly known as sticky willow or mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces tiny, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. Drymaria viscosa is often found in moist, grassy areas and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens."
