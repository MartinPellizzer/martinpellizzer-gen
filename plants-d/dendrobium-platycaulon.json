    "intro": "Dendrobium platycaulon, commonly known as the flat-stemmed orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, sympodial growth habit with short, thick stems that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapting to its climbing or epiphytic lifestyle. Dendrobium platycaulon thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
