    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 subaustriaca, commonly known as the Austrian shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris filix-mas and Dryopteris affinis. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients effectively. The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
