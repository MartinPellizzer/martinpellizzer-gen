    "intro": "Ditassa lisae, commonly known as the lisae dittassa, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a cluster of tiny bells. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in humid forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
