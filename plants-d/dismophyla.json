    "intro": "Dismophyla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its elongated, pale green stems and its unique, fragrant, white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Dismophyla lacks true leaves and relies on its stems for photosynthesis. Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species."
