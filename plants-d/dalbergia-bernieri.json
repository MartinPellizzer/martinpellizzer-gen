    "intro": "Dalbergia bernieri, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The tree produces flat, woody pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It is valued for its dense, dark-colored wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
