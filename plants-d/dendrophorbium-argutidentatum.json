    "intro": "Dendrophorbium argutidentatum, commonly known as the sharp-toothed fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that feature serrated margins and a dense arrangement of small, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is thick and wiry, supporting the growth of its delicate foliage. The spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
