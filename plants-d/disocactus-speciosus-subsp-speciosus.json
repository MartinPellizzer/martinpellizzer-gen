    "intro": "Disocactus speciosus subsp. speciosus, commonly known as the Easter cactus, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its segmented, spiny stems that form a compact, branching structure. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
