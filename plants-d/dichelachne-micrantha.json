It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a prominent midrib. Dichelachne micrantha is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of wetland ecosystems."
