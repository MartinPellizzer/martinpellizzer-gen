    "intro": "Dendrobium lampongense, commonly known as the Lampong orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. Dendrobium lampongense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
