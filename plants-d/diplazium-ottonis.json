    "intro": "Diplazium ottonis, commonly known as the golden thread fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
