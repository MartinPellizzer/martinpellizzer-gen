    "intro": "Dendrobium occultum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific symbiotic fungi for nutrient absorption. Its name, \"occultum,\" reflects its elusive and seldom-seen nature in the wild. Due to habitat destruction, Dendrobium occultum is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
