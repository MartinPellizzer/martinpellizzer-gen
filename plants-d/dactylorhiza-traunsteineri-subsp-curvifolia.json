    "intro": "Dactylorhiza traunsteineri subsp. curvifolia, commonly known as the curving-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that curve slightly at the tips. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a loose spike, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet or marshy habitats, often found in peat bogs and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
