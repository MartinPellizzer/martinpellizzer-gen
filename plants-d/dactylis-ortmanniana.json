    "intro": "Dactylis ortmanniana, commonly known as ortmann's grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in meadows and open woodlands. Dactylis ortmanniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
