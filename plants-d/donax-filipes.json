    "intro": "Donax filipes, commonly known as the slender sea bean, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Leguminosae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in brackish or saltwater environments. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in clusters, and the seeds are enclosed in slender, spirally twisted pods. Donax filipes plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
