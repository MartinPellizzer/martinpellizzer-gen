    "intro": "Donkelaaria diversifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, elongated leaves and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It is adapted to arid conditions and has a compact growth habit that helps it conserve water. Donkelaaria diversifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
