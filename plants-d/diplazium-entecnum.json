    "intro": "Diplazium entecnum, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with dense, dark green, compound fronds that are often used in horticulture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The botanical structure of Diplazium entecnum reflects its adaptation to humid, nutrient-rich soils."
