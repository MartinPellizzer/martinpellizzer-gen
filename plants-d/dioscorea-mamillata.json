    "intro": "Dioscorea mamillata, commonly known as the African yam bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by tuberous roots that are used both as food and for medicinal purposes. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its stems are typically hairy. Dioscorea mamillata is valued not only for its edible tubers but also for its traditional use in herbal medicine."
