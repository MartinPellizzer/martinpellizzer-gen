    "intro": "Dryopteris inaequalifolia, commonly known as the unequal-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed fronds that are often asymmetrical, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
