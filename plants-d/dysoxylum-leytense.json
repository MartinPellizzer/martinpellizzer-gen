    "intro": "Dysoxylum leytense, commonly known as the Leyte ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for construction and furniture. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
