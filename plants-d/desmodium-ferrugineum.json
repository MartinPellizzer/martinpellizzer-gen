    "intro": "Desmodium ferrugineum, commonly known as rusty milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with reddish-brown veins and small, pea-like flowers that range from pink to purple. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Desmodium ferrugineum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
