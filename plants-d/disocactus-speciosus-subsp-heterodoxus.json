    "intro": "Disocactus speciosus subsp. heterodoxus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic cactus native to the tropical regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its long, slender stems that often resemble orchid flowers, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or botanical gardens."
