    "intro": "Dendrophthoe philippensis, commonly known as the Philippine dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the Philippines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, often attaching itself to trees or shrubs via specialized root-like structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves seed dispersal by animals. Its ecological role is significant in certain forest ecosystems, though it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings. Due to habitat loss, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
