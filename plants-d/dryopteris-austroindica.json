    "intro": "Dryopteris austroindica, commonly known as the Indian wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate or tripinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to establish itself in various soil types. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle."
