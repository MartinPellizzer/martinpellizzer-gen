It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in thick, ribbed structures. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines are long and widely spaced, providing protection from herbivores. Discocactus latispinus is well adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water."
