    "intro": "Diplazium melanosorum, commonly known as the black-stemmed sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it forms dense colonies. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various habitats. The fronds are evergreen, providing a lush, green appearance throughout the year."
