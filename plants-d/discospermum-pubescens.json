    "intro": "Discospermum pubescens, commonly known as the hairy spondias, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and hairy, ovate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical, yellowish fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
