    "intro": "Dennstaedtia elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's water fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants in temperate rainforest ecosystems."
