    "intro": "Davallia saccoloma, commonly known as the horse's tail fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its long, segmented, creeping rhizomes that produce upright, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive appearance that resembles a horse's tail. Davallia saccoloma is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
