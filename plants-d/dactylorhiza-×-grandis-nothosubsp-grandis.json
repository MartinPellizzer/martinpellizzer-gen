    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 grandis nothosubsp. grandis, commonly known as the greater marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. The plant thrives in wet, boggy habitats and is often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. It has a complex floral structure typical of orchids, with a well-developed labellum and column. The species is notable for its ability to hybridize with other Dactylorhiza species, leading to the formation of various nothosubspecies."
