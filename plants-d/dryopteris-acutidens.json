    "intro": "Dryopteris acutidens, commonly known as the narrowleaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are grouped in clusters. Dryopteris acutidens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
