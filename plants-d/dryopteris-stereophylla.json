    "intro": "Dryopteris stereophylla, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically divided into numerous segments, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium."
