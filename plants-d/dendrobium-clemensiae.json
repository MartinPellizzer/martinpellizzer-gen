    "intro": "Dendrobium clemensiae, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, which bloom during the dry season. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb moisture and nutrients from its environment. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
