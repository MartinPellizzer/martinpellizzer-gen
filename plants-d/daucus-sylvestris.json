    "intro": "Daucus sylvestris, commonly known as wild carrot, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like parsley and anise. The plant features a slender, hollow stem with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine white coating. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp that splits into two parts when mature, each containing a single seed."
