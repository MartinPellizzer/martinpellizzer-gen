    "intro": "Digitaria conjugata, commonly known as flatgrass or flatseeds, is a species of grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its flat, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and agricultural areas. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Digitaria conjugata is considered a weed in some regions but can also serve as forage for livestock."
