    "intro": "Diplazium striatum var. truncata, commonly known as the truncated sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often truncate at the base. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
