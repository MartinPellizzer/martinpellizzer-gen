    "intro": "Deparia viridifrons, commonly known as the green-backed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and woodland areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia, which are responsible for its reproductive cycle. The leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
