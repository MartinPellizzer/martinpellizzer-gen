    "intro": "Dichanthelium clandestinum, commonly known as the hidden panic grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This species is notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in certain ecosystems."
