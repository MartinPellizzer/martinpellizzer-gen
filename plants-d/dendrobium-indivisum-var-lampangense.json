    "intro": "Dendrobium indivisum var. lampangense, commonly known as the Lampang orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to Thailand. It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs covered with a thick, leathery epidermis that helps it store moisture. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns that enhance its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
