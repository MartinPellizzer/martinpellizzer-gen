    "intro": "Daphne foetida, commonly known as the winter daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features aromatic, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. Its stems are typically woody and covered in a fine, powdery coating. Daphne foetida is known for its toxic sap, which can cause severe skin irritation and should be handled with care."
