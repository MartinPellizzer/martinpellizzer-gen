    "intro": "Dryopteris oligophylla var. lutescens, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow fronds that contrast with its dark green base. The plant is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give it a dense, compact appearance. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique coloration."
