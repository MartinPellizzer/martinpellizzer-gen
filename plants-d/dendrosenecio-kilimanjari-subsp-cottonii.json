    "intro": "Dendrosenecio kilimanjari subsp. cottonii, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro tree heath, is a succulent shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Tanzania. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its unique morphology and adaptations make it well-suited for rocky and exposed environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
