    "intro": "Dichapetalum reliquum, commonly known as the relic dichapetalum, is a rare and critically endangered flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Dilleniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, white to pinkish flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and humid climates. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered one of the most threatened species in its native range. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique botanical species."
