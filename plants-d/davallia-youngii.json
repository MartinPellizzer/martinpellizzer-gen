    "intro": "Davallia youngii, commonly known as the silver-veined hartiye, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green with distinct silver veins. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and prefers well-draining, moist soil. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fuzzy coating, which helps retain moisture. Davallia youngii is popular in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of care."
