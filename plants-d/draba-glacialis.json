    "intro": "Draba glacialis, commonly known as the glacier buttercup, is a low-growing flowering plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette and are covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Draba glacialis is often found in mountainous areas and is considered a symbol of resilience in harsh environments."
