    "intro": "Drosera hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are often rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of digestive secretions. Drosera hirsuta is a perennial species that produces small, pinkish-white flowers during the warmer months."
