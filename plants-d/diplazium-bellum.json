    "intro": "Diplazium bellum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a glossy appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are divided into lance-shaped segments, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures on the underside of its fronds. Diplazium bellum is often found in tropical and subtropical forests, where it thrives in humid, low-light conditions."
