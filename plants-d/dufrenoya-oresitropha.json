    "intro": "Dufrenoya oresitropha, commonly known as the slender dufrenoyaceae, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Dufrenoyaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring small, narrow leaves and a delicate, branching structure. This plant is typically found in specific microhabitats, often in moist, shaded environments within tropical or subtropical regions. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a relict species, offering insights into ancient plant evolution. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
