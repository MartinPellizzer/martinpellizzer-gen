    "intro": "Diplazium platylepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often lobed fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a consistent presence in the understory vegetation."
