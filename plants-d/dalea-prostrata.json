    "intro": "Dalea prostrata, commonly known as creeping milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its prostrate habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval leaflets that are covered in fine hairs. Dalea prostrata is adapted to rocky and sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe."
