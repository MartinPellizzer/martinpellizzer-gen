    "intro": "Duvaua sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous vine, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive if not controlled."
