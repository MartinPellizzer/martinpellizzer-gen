    "intro": "Drosanthemum marinum, commonly known as the sea daisies, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to salty coastal environments. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Drosanthemum marinum is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
