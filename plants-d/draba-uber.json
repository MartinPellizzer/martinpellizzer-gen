    "intro": "Draba uber, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, typically found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. Draba uber produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments."
