    "intro": "Dianella brevipedunculata, commonly known as the small-fruited flax lily, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to southern Australia, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and heathlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue to purple flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are small, three-angled berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Dianella brevipedunculata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
