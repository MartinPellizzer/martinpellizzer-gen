    "intro": "Dryopteris remota, commonly known as the remote wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are typically divided into narrow segments with a feathery appearance, and they are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
