    "intro": "Decalepidanthus flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in cones, a feature typical of cycads. It is native to the tropical regions of Africa and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often found in protected habitats and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
