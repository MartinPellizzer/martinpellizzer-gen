    "intro": "Disa bisetosa, commonly known as the double-flowered disa, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers with a distinctive double-petaled structure. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its blooms appear in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Disa bisetosa is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
