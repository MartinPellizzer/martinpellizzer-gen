It typically grows in wet to mesic habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Botanically, it is notable for its morphological distinctiveness within the genus Deyeuxia."
