    "intro": "Didissandra johorica, commonly known as the Johor sandstone plant, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Singapore. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often woody stems. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom during the rainy season. Didissandra johorica is often found growing on rocky substrates and is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sunny environments. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
