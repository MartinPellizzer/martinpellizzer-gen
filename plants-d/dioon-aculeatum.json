    "intro": "Dioon aculeatum, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of cycad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its leaves are often covered in small, spiny structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Dioon aculeatum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
