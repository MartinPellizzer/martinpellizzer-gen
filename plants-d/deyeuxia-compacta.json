    "intro": "Deyeuxia compacta, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, pond margins, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments. Deyeuxia compacta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
