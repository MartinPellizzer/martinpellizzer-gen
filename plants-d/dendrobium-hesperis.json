    "intro": "Dendrobium hesperis, commonly known as the Western orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces racemes of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium hesperis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
