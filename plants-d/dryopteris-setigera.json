    "intro": "Dryopteris setigera, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like fronds that are often covered in a rusty-brown to cinnamon-colored fiddlehead, which gives it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds can grow up to 1.5 meters in length, and they unfurl in a spiral pattern. Dryopteris setigera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
