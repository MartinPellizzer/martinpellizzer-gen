    "intro": "Disporum sessile subsp. flavens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered disporum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring. Its subspecies status is distinguished by its more vibrant yellow floral coloration compared to other disporum species. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various invertebrates."
