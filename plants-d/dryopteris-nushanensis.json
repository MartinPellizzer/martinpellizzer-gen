    "intro": "Dryopteris nushanensis, commonly known as the Nushan wood fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to the substrate. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
