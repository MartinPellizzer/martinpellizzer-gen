    "intro": "Drynaria rigidula var. whitei, commonly known as the white-veined tree fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the growth of the fronds above. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow in the dark, which is a unique botanical feature."
