    "intro": "Dyckia rupestris, commonly known as the rock dyckia, is a species of flowering plant in the bromeliad family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, giving it a frosty appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear at the center of the rosette. Dyckia rupestris is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
