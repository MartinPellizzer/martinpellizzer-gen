    "intro": "Diothonea lloensis, commonly known as the Lloentie's ghostflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Chile. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for its unique pale blue petals and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, arid soils. Diothonea lloensis is often found growing in rocky outcrops and has adapted to extreme environmental conditions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
