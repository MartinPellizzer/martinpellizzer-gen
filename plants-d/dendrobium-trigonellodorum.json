    "intro": "Dendrobium trigonellodorum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, elongated flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the dry season. It has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Dendrobium trigonellodorum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
