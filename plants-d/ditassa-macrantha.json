    "intro": "Ditassa macrantha, commonly known as the giant sedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and broad, grass-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found in swampy areas or along riverbanks. Due to its striking appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in wetland gardens."
