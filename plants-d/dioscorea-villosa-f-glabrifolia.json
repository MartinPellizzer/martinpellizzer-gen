    "intro": "Dioscorea villosa f. glabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaf yam, is a variant of the wild yam species native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves, which distinguish it from the more hairy form of the species. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. Its tuberous roots are similar to those of other yam species, though they are less commonly cultivated. This plant is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its potential medicinal properties."
