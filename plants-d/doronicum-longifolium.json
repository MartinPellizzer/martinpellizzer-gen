    "intro": "Doronicum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved leopard's bane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with prominent dark centers, resembling a leopard's spots, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Doronicum longifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
