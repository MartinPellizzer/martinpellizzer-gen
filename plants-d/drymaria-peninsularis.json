    "intro": "Drymaria peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsula sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes. The plant features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. It is adapted to arid conditions and has a shallow root system for efficient water absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
