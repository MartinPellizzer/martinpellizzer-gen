    "intro": "Drepananthus havilandii, commonly known as Haviland's hookless cactus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cactaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. The plant's ability to store water in its stems makes it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
