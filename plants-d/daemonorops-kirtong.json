    "intro": "Daemonorops kirtong, commonly known as the Kirtong palm, is a species of cycad-like plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and as thatching materials in local communities. Due to habitat loss, Daemonorops kirtong is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
