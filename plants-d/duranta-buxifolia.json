    "intro": "Duranta buxifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf duranta, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often mistaken for those of boxwood, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to yellow, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Duranta buxifolia is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
