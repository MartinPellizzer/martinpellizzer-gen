    "intro": "Dianthus algetanus subsp. turolensis, commonly known as the Turolense Campion, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is found in mountainous regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
