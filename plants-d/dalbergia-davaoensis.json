It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces hard, dense wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. It thrives in tropical rainforests and requires a humid, warm climate with well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and slow growth, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in its native habitat."
