    "intro": "Danthonia planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf danthonia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, flat leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
