    "intro": "Digitaria paspaliformis, commonly known as the silky grass or slender digitgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, soft, and hairy leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and waste places. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Digitaria paspaliformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
