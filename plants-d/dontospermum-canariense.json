    "intro": "Dontospermum canariense, commonly known as the Canary Island mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant attaches itself to host trees, primarily laurel species, through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host. It plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for birds and insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
