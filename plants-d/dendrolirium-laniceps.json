    "intro": "Dendrolirium laniceps, commonly known as the woolly lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy inflorescence that resembles a cluster of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dendrolirium laniceps is considered a vulnerable species."
