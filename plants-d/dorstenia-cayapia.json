    "intro": "Dorstenia cayapia, commonly known as the Cayapia mountain cucumber, is a member of the family Malvaceae, characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often ribbed fruits. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in cloud forests at elevations around 1,500 to 2,500 meters. The plant produces distinctive, cucumber-like fruits that are typically green and covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the stems are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, high-altitude habitat. Dorstenia cayapia is also notable for its ability to climb using tendrils, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
