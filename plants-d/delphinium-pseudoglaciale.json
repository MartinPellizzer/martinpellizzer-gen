It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of striking blue to violet flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a waxy coating that helps it withstand cold and arid conditions. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense spikes, and it blooms during the summer months. Delphinium pseudoglaciale is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, which includes other toxic plants, and it contains alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals."
