    "intro": "Dendrobium hocklengii, commonly known as the Hockleng orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
