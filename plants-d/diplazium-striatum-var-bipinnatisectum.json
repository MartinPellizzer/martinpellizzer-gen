    "intro": "Diplazium striatum var. bipinnatisectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatisect leaves. The fronds are typically arching and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in shaded environments. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate forests. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
