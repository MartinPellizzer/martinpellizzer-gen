    "intro": "Dendrolirium albidotomentosum, commonly known as the white-tomentose orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers with white petals and a yellowish lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
