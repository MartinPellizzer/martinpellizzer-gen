    "intro": "Diplatia, commonly known as the golden cup-mud or golden cup-moss, is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae. These small, non-vascular plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. They have a thalloid structure, which is a flat, leaf-like body that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. Diplatia species are characterized by their intricate leaf-like structures and specialized reproductive organs called gametophores. They play an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in their habitats."
