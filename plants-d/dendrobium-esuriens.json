    "intro": "Dendrobium esuriens, commonly known as the starry orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive central lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium esuriens is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
