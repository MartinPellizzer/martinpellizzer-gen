It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by bright orange berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
