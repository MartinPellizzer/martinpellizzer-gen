    "intro": "Dianthus requienii var. baeticus, commonly known as the Baeticus Campion, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
