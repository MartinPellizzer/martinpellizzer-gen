It is characterized by its slender, triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along water edges. Deyeuxia uncinioides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
