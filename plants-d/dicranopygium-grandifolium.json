    "intro": "Dicranopygium grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leafed moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green, glossy foliage. The leaves are typically elongated and have a distinct midrib, which is a key identifying feature. This moss thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on rock surfaces. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on slender stalks and release spores when mature."
