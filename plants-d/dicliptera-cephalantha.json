    "intro": "Dicliptera cephalantha, commonly known as the red-flowered grass or redhead grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is notable for its striking red or purple flower spikes that appear at the ends of its stems. Its inflorescence consists of dense, clustered spikelets that are often mistaken for flowers, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Dicliptera cephalantha thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks."
