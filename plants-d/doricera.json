    "intro": "Doricera, commonly known as the dwarf daisy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit, with hairy, narrow leaves that help it retain moisture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Doricera is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
