    "intro": "Danaea, commonly known as the flame flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly in the Caribbean and Central America. Danaea species are characterized by their showy, often tubular flowers that come in a range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The leaves are typically ovate or elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. They are often grown as ornamental plants due to their vibrant blooms and compact growth habit."
