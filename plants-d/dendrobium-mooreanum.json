    "intro": "Dendrobium mooreanum, commonly known as the Moorean orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, narrow labellum. Dendrobium mooreanum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
