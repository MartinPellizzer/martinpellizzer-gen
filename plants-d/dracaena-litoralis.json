It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and long, narrow leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant is adapted to saline environments, making it highly tolerant of coastal conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red berries, which are an important food source for birds. Dracaena litoralis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging coastal climates."
