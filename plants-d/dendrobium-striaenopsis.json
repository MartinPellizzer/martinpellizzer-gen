The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. Its leaves are narrow,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and arranged in two ranks, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
