    "intro": "Dodonaea kohautiana, commonly known as the coastal doddonaea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it a hardy plant in coastal ecosystems. Dodonaea kohautiana plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
