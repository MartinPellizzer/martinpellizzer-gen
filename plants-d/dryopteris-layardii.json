    "intro": "Dryopteris layardii, commonly known as the Layard's wood fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it popular among fern enthusiasts. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific conditions to flourish."
