    "intro": "Dregea corrugata, commonly known as the wrinkled dregea, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a distinctive, elongated pod that splits open to release its seeds. Dregea corrugata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, arid environments."
