    "intro": "Delissea grimesiana var. mauiensis, commonly known as Maui's ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in moist, shaded forest environments. It has small, strap-like leaves and produces fragrant, white to pale yellow blooms. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
