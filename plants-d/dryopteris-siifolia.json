    "intro": "Dryopteris siifolia, commonly known as the siifolia wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
