    "intro": "Dryopteris rigida var. arguta, commonly known as the soft shield fern, is a variant of the hard shield fern native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are typically shorter and more delicate than those of the typical variety. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin, protective indusium."
