    "intro": "Dryopteris iguapensis, commonly known as the Iguap\u00e9 Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. The Iguap\u00e9 Shield Fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
