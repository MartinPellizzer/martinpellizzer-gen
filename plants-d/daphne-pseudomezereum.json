    "intro": "Daphne pseudomezereum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural gardens."
