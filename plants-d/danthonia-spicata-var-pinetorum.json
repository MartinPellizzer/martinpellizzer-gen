    "intro": "Danthonia spicata var. pinetorum, commonly known as the coastal grass or sandhill grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes, pine flatwoods, and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically reddish-brown in color. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and periodic flooding. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of coastal vegetation and a valuable plant for erosion control."
