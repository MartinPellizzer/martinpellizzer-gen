    "intro": "Didissandra taliensis f. robusta, commonly known as the robust sandstone plant, is a rare and unique member of the Araliaceae family. It is native to the rocky, arid regions of southern China, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and its ability to store water, making it highly adapted to its harsh environment. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fleshy berries. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
