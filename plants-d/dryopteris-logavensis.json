    "intro": "Dryopteris logavensis, commonly known as the Logavensian wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its ecological significance in tropical ecosystems."
