    "intro": "Dryandra sessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dryandra, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and showy, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited to Mediterranean climates. Its floral structure consists of a central style surrounded by numerous stamens, which are often brightly colored and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Dryandra sessilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
