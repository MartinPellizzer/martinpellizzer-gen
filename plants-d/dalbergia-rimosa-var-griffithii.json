    "intro": "Dalbergia rimosa var. griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's rosewood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark wood with a rich, aromatic scent. The plant typically grows in lowland forests and has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. This species is valued for its timber but is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
