    "intro": "Dryopteris ancyriothrix, commonly known as the broad holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant is native to the forests of eastern North America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
