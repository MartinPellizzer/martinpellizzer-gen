    "intro": "Dryopteris otarioides, commonly known as the Alaska fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps over time. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
