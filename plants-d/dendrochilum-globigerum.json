    "intro": "Dendrochilum globigerum, commonly known as the globular orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic lifestyle. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture. The flowers bloom in clusters and are often pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
