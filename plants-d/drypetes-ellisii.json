    "intro": "Drypetes ellisii, commonly known as the red-flowered ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and dense, glossy green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers followed by round, orange-red fruits that are about 1.5 cm in diameter. It is often found in lowland and hill forest areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
