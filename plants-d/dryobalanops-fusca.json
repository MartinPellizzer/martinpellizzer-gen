    "intro": "Dryobalanops fusca, commonly known as the Malacca ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark hardwood and is often found in lowland dipterocarp forests. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy upper surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, oblong fruits. Due to its slow growth and high-quality timber, it is considered a valuable but threatened species."
