It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive scaly appearance on the underside, giving it its common name. It prefers moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded gardens."
