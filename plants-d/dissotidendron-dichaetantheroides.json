    "intro": "Dissotidendron dichaetantheroides, commonly known as the two-armed mountain pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of southern China. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring two distinct types of cones on the same plant, a trait known as dichasiation. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the branches. Its cones are often woody and can persist on the tree for several years before dispersing seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
