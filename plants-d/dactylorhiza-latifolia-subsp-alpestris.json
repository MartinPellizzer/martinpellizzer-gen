It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky areas. The plant has a single, erect stem with several oval, leathery leaves. Its flowers are pale green to yellowish, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It is a perennial species that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, typical of many orchid species."
