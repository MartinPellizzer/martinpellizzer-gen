    "intro": "[WRONG START] Dendrobium \u00d7 rupriosum, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a phalaenopsis-like orchid that results from the cross between Dendrobium nobile and Dendrobium rupiosum. It is an epiphytic plant, typically found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a fragrant scent, and bloom in clusters along the stems. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated for horticultural purposes."
