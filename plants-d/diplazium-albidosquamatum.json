    "intro": "Diplazium albidosquamatum, commonly known as the white-scaled water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds with a distinctive white-scaled appearance on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the fronds are sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. The plant's morphology reflects adaptations to its humid, tropical habitat."
