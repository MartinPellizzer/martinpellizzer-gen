    "intro": "Distichorchis uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, showy flower that blooms in a specific seasonal pattern. The plant has a compact growth habit with a short rhizome and a single leaf, which is typically broad and lance-shaped. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
