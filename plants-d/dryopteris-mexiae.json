    "intro": "Dryopteris mexiae, commonly known as the Mexican wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread and establish in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. This fern is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
