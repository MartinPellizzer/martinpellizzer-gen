    "intro": "Doratoxylon diversifolium, commonly known as the multileaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its succulent stems and leaves are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Doratoxylon diversifolium is often found in sandy soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
