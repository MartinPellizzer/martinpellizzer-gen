    "intro": "Dombeya globosa, commonly known as the globe dombeya, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Africa. It is characterized by its showy, globe-shaped flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces white to pinkish flowers that are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and often branched. Dombeya globosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil and full sun."
