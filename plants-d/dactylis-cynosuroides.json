    "intro": "Dactylis cynosuroides, commonly known as cock's-comb grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence, which resembles a cock's comb due to its dense, bristly appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. Dactylis cynosuroides is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop for livestock."
