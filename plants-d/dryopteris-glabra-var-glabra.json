    "intro": "Dryopteris glabra var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a perennial fern native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are smooth and glabrous, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
