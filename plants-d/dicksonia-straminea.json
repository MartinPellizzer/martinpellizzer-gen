    "intro": "Dicksonia straminea, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, light green fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are typically divided into segments, with the uppermost ones being the longest and most delicate. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This plant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
