It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other valuable hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its smooth, whitish bark and elongated, narrow leaves. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the natural environment."
