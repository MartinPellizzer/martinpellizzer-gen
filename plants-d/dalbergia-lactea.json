    "intro": "Dalbergia lactea, commonly known as the white sandwood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and trifoliate leaves with stipules. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry savanna or woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential for timber, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for reforestation purposes."
