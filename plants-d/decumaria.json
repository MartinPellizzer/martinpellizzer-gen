    "intro": "Decumaria, commonly known as wild ginger, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, hooded flowers that range in color from green to purple. Decumaria thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest in both horticulture and traditional herbal medicine."
