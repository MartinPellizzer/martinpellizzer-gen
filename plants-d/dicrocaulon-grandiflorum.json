It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. Its flowering period occurs in the spring, and it is often found in association with other woodland flora. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
