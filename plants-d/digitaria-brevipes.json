    "intro": "Digitaria brevipes, commonly known as little finger grass, is a warm-season grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its short, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and pastures. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a common weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
