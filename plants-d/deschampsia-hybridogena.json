    "intro": "Deschampsia hybridogena, commonly known as the hybrid oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Deschampsia hybridogena is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
