    "intro": "Diapensia lapponica subsp. obovata, commonly known as the Lapland diapensia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval to obovate in shape, with a leathery texture adapted to cold and harsh environments. This subspecies is well-suited to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous regions."
