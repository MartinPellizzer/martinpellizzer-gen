    "intro": "Drynaria ovata, commonly known as the bamboo fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with long, arching fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's unique structure and growth pattern make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
