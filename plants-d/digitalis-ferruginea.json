    "intro": "Digitalis ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty foxglove, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, rusty-colored down, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in woodland and meadow habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
