    "intro": "Dalbergia lindeniana, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant has pinnate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The fruit is a legume pod containing several flattened, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks."
