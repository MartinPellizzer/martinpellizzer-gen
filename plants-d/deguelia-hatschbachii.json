It is characterized by its striking yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has compound leaves with lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense rainforest canopies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other parts of the world for horticultural purposes."
