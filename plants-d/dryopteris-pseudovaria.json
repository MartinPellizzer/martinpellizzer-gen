    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudovaria, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure that gives the plant a delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction."
