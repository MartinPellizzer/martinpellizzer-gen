    "intro": "Dicorynia spruceana, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its tall stature, reaching up to 50 meters in height, and its broad, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its fruit is a woody capsule containing up to 18 seeds, known as Brazil nuts. The plant has a complex symbiotic relationship with specific pollinators and seed dispersers, which are crucial for its reproduction. Its ecological importance is significant, as it supports a wide range of biodiversity in the rainforest ecosystem."
