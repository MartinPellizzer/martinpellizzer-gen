    "intro": "Diphasiastrum, commonly known as the common spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs characterized by their milky sap and alternate leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. These plants are often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environments, including wetlands and grasslands. Some species are considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes."
