    "intro": "Dodonaea eriocarpa f. pallida, commonly known as the pale-leaved hop bush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, pale green leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and sandy environments. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate salt spray and coastal conditions."
