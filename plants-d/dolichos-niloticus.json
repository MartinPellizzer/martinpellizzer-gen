    "intro": "Dolichos niloticus, commonly known as the slender cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its edible seeds, which are rich in protein. Dolichos niloticus also plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
