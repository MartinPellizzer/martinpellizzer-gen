    "intro": "Dischidia spatulata, commonly known as the spoon-leaf fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically ovate to spoon-shaped, giving it its common name. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, and it is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value. Dischidia spatulata is also known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its relatively easy care requirements."
