It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and feathery, pinnate fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its fronds are often deeply divided, with a narrow, lance-shaped leaf blade. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
