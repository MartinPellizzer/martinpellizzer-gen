    "intro": "Diplazium serratifolium, commonly known as the serrated shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with serrated margins that give it its common name. Diplazium serratifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
