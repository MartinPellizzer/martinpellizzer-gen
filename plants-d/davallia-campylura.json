    "intro": "Davallia campylura, commonly known as the fern with curled fronds, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often curl at the tips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in high humidity. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense, compact clumps, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. The leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
