    "intro": "Diolena pileoides, commonly known as the white marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are grass-like and often form dense clumps, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to waterlogged conditions. Diolena pileoides plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
