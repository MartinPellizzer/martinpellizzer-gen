    "intro": "Didymoplexis minor var. amboinensis, commonly known as the Amboina dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight sheen. The plant produces fragrant, small flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often arranged in a loose cluster. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
