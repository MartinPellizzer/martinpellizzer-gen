    "intro": "Danthonia procera, commonly known as the tall muirgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southern hemisphere, particularly found in Australia and New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Danthonia procera is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
