    "intro": "Duranta armata, commonly known as the golden bell vine, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a vigorous climber with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive bluish-green color. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, yellow-orange flowers that are highly attractive to hummingbirds and other pollinators. Its fruits are small, three-lobed berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Duranta armata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types and light conditions."
