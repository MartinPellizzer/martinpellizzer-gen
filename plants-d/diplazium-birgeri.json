    "intro": "Diplazium birgeri, commonly known as the golden thread fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow to golden-green fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. Diplazium birgeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
