    "intro": "Dianthus anticarius subsp. saorinii, commonly known as the Canary Islands campion, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, displaying a compact growth habit with hairy stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine pubescence, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to the island's climate and its limited distribution."
