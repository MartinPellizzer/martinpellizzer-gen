    "intro": "Dimorphanthera elegantissima var. elegantissima, commonly known as the elegant flame orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that feature vibrant red and orange hues, often with contrasting yellow and white markings. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate, pendulous flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to the humid, shaded environments where it grows. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
