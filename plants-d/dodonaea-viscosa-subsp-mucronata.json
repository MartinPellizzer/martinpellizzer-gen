    "intro": "Dodonaea viscosa subsp. mucronata, commonly known as the smooth dodonaea, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually smooth and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in racemes, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
