    "intro": "Draba nivalis f. nana, commonly known as the alpine winter cress, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. It has small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. Draba nivalis f. nana is a hardy species that is often found in snowfields and mountain meadows during the brief summer growing season."
