    "intro": "Didymoglossum micropubescens, commonly known as the small-hairy bladder grass, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, grass-like leaves with a distinctive pubescent texture. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is typically found in moist, nutrient-poor habitats such as wet meadows and bogs. Didymoglossum micropubescens is a cryptic species that is often difficult to distinguish from other similar bladder grasses without careful microscopic examination."
