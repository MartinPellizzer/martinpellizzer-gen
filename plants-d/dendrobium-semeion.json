    "intro": "Dendrobium semeion, commonly known as the Semeion orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often resembling a cluster of grapes. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. Dendrobium semeion is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
