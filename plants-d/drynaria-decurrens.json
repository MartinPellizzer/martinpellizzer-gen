    "intro": "Drynaria decurrens, commonly known as the walking fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant has feather-like fronds with a distinctive, recurved shape, and it produces spore-bearing structures called soruses on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique growth habit and ornamental value, it is cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
