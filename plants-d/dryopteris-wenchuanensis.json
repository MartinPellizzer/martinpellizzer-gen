    "intro": "Dryopteris wenchuanensis, commonly known as the Wenchuan wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture and a deep green color."
