It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features compound leaves with alternate arrangement and small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, and the plant is noted for its aromatic properties. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in lowland forests and is of interest to botanists studying tropical flora."
