The plant has fibrous roots that contribute to soil stabilization, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that gives it its common name. Dissochaeta sarcorhiza is often found in grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils."
