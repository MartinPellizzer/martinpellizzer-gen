    "intro": "Dorycnium crantzii, commonly known as the creeping yellow trefoil, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typical of the Fabaceae family, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Dorycnium crantzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
