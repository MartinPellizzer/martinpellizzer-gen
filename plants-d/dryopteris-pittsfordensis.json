    "intro": "Dryopteris pittsfordensis, commonly known as the Pittsford fern, is a rare and endangered species of fern native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rich, acidic soils within forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal rather than sexual reproduction. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
