    "intro": "Dianthus deltoides subsp. degenii, commonly known as the sand dune campion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fuzzy, silver-green foliage that helps it withstand salty air and sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of pink or red flowers with five petals, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important species for stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion."
