    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudoarbuscula, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the southern United States. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with thick, creeping stems that help it spread across the forest floor. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats."
