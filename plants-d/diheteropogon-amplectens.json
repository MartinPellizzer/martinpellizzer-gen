    "intro": "Diheteropogon amplectens, commonly known as the clasping grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that often wrap around the stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along waterways. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
