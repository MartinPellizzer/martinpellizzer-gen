    "intro": "Dilatris caroliana, commonly known as the Carolian mangrove, is a species native to tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in brackish or saline water environments, such as mangrove swamps. The plant has prop roots that help stabilize it in soft, waterlogged soils and allow for gas exchange. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Dilatris caroliana plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
