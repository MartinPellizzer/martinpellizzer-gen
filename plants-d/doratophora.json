    "intro": "Doratophora, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeralaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that open during the day and close at night. Doratophora species typically thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Their roots are anchored in the substrate, while their leaves float on the water's surface. The flowers play a crucial role in attracting pollinators like beetles and bees, contributing to the plant's reproductive success."
