It is characterized by its intricate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. Diplazium werckleanum is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
