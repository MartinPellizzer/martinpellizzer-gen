    "intro": "Dictyophragmus punensis, commonly known as the Peruvian rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Andean regions of Peru. It features a compact, globular stem with a thick, fleshy body adapted for water storage. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the dry season, typically in spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Dictyophragmus punensis thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy species suited to arid environments."
