It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in coastal areas and sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
