    "intro": "Dryopteris demerarana, commonly known as the Demerara wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients effectively. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
