    "intro": "Dalbergia macrophylla, commonly known as rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its rich color and fine grain. The plant has compound leaves with an odd number of leaflets, typically ranging from 5 to 9. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, round pods containing flattened seeds. The species is also noted for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a rare and precious resource in the timber trade."
