    "intro": "Drymonia tolimensis, commonly known as the Tolima fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the family Drymariaceae and is characterized by its unique frond structure, which consists of a central axis with specialized leaf-like structures called pinnae. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for the conservation of Andean ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection."
