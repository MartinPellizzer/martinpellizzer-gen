    "intro": "Desmodium lacei, commonly known as the laceleaf burr legume, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and have a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a hairy, three-lobed pod that contains several seeds. Desmodium lacei is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine in some parts of its native range."
