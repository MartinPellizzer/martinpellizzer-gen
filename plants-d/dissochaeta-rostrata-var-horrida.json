It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and biodiversity."
