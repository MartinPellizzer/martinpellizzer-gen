    "intro": "Digitaria pes-avis, commonly known as the \"chicken foot grass,\" is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains, which are wind-pollinated. Digitaria pes-avis is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control in certain ecosystems."
