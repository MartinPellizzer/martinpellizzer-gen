    "intro": "Dryopteris davalliiformis, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are deeply lobed and resemble shields. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
