    "intro": "Diplazium umbrosum var. procerum, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed fern Diplazium umbrosum. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow fronds that are typically longer than those of the typical variety. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky or forested slopes. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
