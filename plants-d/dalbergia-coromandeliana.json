    "intro": "Dalbergia coromandeliana, commonly known as Indian rosewood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has compound leaves with trifoliate or pinnate arrangements, and its flowers are typically small and yellow or greenish in color. It produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The tree is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia in its root system."
