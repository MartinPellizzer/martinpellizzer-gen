    "intro": "Dieffenbachia seguine var. lineata, commonly known as the Snowflake Dieffenbachia, is a tropical houseplant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that feature white and green patterns, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, which includes other ornamental plants like peace lilies and calla lilies. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is toxic if ingested, so it should be kept away from pets and children."
