    "intro": "Danthonia schneideri var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf danthonia, is a low-growing, clump-forming grass native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a fine texture and a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered at the base of the stems, contributing to its ornamental appeal in native gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and other damp habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is valued for both its aesthetic and ecological roles in wetland ecosystems."
