    "intro": "Derris, commonly known as the devil's bean, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, trifoliate leaves, and distinctive yellow flowers. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods and contain toxic alkaloids, making it both dangerous and valuable in traditional medicine. Derris species are often used in pest control due to their toxic properties."
