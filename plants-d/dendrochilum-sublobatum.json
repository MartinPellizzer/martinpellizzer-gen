    "intro": "Dendrochilum sublobatum, commonly known as the sublobate tree orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and relatively large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a distinctive lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. Dendrochilum sublobatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
