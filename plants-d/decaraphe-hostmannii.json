    "intro": "Decaraphe hostmannii, commonly known as the Hostmann's decaraphe, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with cool climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
