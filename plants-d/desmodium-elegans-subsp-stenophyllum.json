    "intro": "Desmodium elegans subsp. stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with narrow, ovate leaflets and produces small, yellow to reddish-pink flowers. The plant is characterized by its erect, branching stems and is often found in disturbed soils or open habitats. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria. The seeds are typically enclosed in slender, cylindrical pods and are used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop."
