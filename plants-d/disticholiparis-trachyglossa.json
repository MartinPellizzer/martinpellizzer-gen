    "intro": "Disticholiparis trachyglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The flowers have a distinctive lip that is shorter and narrower than the other petals, giving it its scientific name."
