    "intro": "Dendrobium aprinum, commonly known as the apricot orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the summer months. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. Dendrobium aprinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
