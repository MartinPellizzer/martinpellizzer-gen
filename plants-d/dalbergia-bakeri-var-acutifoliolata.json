    "intro": "Dalbergia bakeri var. acutifoliolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its small, pinnate leaves with acute leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its wood is highly valued for its dense, dark color and fine grain, making it sought after in the furniture and musical instrument industries. However, due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
