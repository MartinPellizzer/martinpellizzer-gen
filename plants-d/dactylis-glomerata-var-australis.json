    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. australis, commonly known as Australian couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, pale green flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is drought-tolerant. This variety is often used in pastures and for erosion control due to its hardiness and adaptability."
