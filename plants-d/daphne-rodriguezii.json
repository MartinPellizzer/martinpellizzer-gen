    "intro": "Daphne rodriguezii, commonly known as Rodriguez daphne, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, often with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant belongs to the Thymelaeaceae family and is known for its evergreen foliage, which remains lush throughout the year. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
