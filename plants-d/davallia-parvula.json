    "intro": "Davallia parvula, commonly known as the hare\u2019s foot fern, is a small evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the paw prints of a hare, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, spore-producing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Davallia parvula is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
