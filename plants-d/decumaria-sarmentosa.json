    "intro": "Decumaria sarmentosa, commonly known as climbing clematis, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It features opposite, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are wiry and twining, allowing it to climb and cover structures effectively. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
