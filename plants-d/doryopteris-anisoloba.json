    "intro": "Doryopteris anisoloba, commonly known as the broad-leafed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles the wings of a bird. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Doryopteris anisoloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
