    "intro": "Delosperma macrostigma, commonly known as the large-stigma ice plant, is a succulent perennial native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners in Mediterranean climates."
