    "intro": "Dracula simia, commonly known as the monkey orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its dark, velvety petals and sepals that resemble the appearance of a monkey's face, giving it its whimsical name. The plant thrives in high humidity and partial shade, typically growing on tree branches or rocks in its natural habitat. Its flowers bloom in late spring and are known for their intricate, almost surreal shapes. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, Dracula simia is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
