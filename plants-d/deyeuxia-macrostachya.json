    "intro": "Deyeuxia macrostachya, commonly known as the giant flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Asia, including China and the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in moist or wetland habitats. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. Its leaves are flat, narrow, and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a distinct midrib. Deyeuxia macrostachya is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
