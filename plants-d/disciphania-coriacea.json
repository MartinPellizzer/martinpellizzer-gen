    "intro": "Disciphania coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf disciphania, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and shrubland habitats. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
