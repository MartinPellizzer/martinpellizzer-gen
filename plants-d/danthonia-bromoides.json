    "intro": "Danthonia bromoides, commonly known as slender feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue. Danthonia bromoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
