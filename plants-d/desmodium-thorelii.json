    "intro": "Desmodium thorelii, commonly known as African velvet bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume pods and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy, pod-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. Desmodium thorelii is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop due to its nutritional value."
