    "intro": "Dicranopteris maritima, commonly known as the coastal fern, is a species of fern native to coastal regions of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are often bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments near the coast. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, which are released during the wet season. Dicranopteris maritima plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
