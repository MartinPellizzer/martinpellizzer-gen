    "intro": "Dendrobium malaitense, commonly known as the Malaita orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the Solomon Islands. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically during the wet season. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28, adapted to withstand the humid and often rainy conditions of its habitat. Dendrobium malaitense is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
