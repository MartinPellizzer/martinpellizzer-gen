It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in umbels. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
