It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates. Davallia koordersii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
