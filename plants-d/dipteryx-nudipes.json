    "intro": "Dipteryx nudipes, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and fragrant flowers. The tree is valued for its dense, dark wood, which is highly sought after in the musical instrument industry. It typically grows in humid lowland forests and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered in many regions."
