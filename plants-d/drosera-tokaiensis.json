    "intro": "Drosera tokaiensis, commonly known as the Tokai Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, sticky leaves that trap insects. The plant's leaves are covered in glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to immobilize prey. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires high humidity and bright light. Drosera tokaiensis is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense colonies in its natural habitat."
