    "intro": "Doria gymnodiscus, commonly known as the sea lettuce, is a type of green algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae. It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like thallus that can vary in color from green to brown depending on the environmental conditions. This species thrives in shallow coastal waters and is often found attached to rocks or submerged structures. Doria gymnodiscus plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an important indicator of water quality in coastal areas."
