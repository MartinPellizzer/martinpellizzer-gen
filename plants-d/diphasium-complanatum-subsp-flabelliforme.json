    "intro": "Diphasium complanatum subsp. flabelliforme, commonly known as the flat-leaf diphasium, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare species within its native range."
