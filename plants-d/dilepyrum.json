    "intro": "Dilepyrum, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produce bell-shaped flowers that are often yellow or orange in color. Dilepyrum species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their attractive blooms and compact growth habit. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making them suitable for rock gardens and borders."
