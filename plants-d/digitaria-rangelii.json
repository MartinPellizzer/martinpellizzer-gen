    "intro": "Digitaria rangelii, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a grass species native to the warm temperate and tropical regions of the Americas. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically arranged in a loose panicle, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. Digitaria rangelii is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in full sun. Its adaptability and rapid growth make it a common weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
