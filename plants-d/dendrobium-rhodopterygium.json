    "intro": "Dendrobium rhodopterygium, commonly known as the red-winged orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, often with red and yellow petals, which are highly sought after in horticulture. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and rarity make it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts."
