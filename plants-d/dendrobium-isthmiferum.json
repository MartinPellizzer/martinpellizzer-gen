    "intro": "Dendrobium isthmiferum, commonly known as the Isthmian orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces multiple racemes of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with red or purple markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium isthmiferum is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
