    "intro": "Delphinium monophyllum, commonly known as the single-leaved larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Delphinium monophyllum is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
