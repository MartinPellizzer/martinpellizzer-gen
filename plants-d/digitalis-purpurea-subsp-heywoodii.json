It features tall, upright stems that bear tubular flowers in shades of purple and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are deeply lobed, and it produces a distinctive seed capsule that splits open to release its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial shade to full sun. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
