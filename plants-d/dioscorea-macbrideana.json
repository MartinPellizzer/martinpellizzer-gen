    "intro": "Dioscorea macbrideana, commonly known as the MacBride's yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary storage organs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by yellowish fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. However, the plant contains toxic compounds and requires careful handling during cultivation and use."
