    "intro": "Dendrobium vagabundum, commonly known as the wandering orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, pendant-like inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Dendrobium vagabundum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its beauty."
