    "intro": "Donella delphinensis, commonly known as the Delphinium of the Pacific Northwest, is a herbaceous perennial native to the moist, shaded forests of the western United States. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of spurred, blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its roots are fibrous and often form dense colonies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora. Donella delphinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
