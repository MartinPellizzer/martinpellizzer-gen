    "intro": "Davallia distans, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a distinctive rosette of waxy, leathery fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem with adventitious roots that anchor it to trees or rocks. Its fronds are typically light green to bluish-green and can grow up to 3 feet in length. Davallia distans thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as an ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
