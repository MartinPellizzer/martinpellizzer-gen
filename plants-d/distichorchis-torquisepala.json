It features a compact, rhizomatous growth habit with a single, upright stem that bears two to three pairs of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, racemose inflorescence with showy, spurred flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. Its flowers have a distinctive, twisted sepal structure, giving it its specific epithet \"torquisepala.\" This orchid thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils."
