    "intro": "Dendrobium demissum, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, wiry pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with white markings, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often arranged in a spiral pattern around the pseudobulbs. Dendrobium demissum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions."
