    "intro": "Draba olympicoides var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the Olympic Mountain draba, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with distinctive four-petaled flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
