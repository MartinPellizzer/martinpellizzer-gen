    "intro": "Dischisma capitatum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves and a single, tall flower stalk that bears a bright yellow composite flower head. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine meadows. Dischisma capitatum is an important part of the local ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various small organisms."
