    "intro": "Doratium, commonly known as the \"spider plant,\" is a member of the Asparagaceae family. It is a perennial evergreen plant native to southern Africa. The plant features long, arching stems that bear clusters of small, grass-like leaves. Its most distinctive feature is the production of delicate, dangling flower spikes that bear tiny white or pink flowers. Doratium is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in a variety of light conditions."
