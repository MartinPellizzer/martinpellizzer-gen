    "intro": "Drosera cistiflora var. violacea, commonly known as the violet-scented sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sweet-smelling nectar to attract insects. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in red or pink tentacles. This variety is known for its attractive appearance and unique method of capturing prey."
