    "intro": "Dryopteris thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland habitats."
