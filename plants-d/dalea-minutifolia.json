    "intro": "Dalea minutifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, pale pink to white flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Dalea minutifolia is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands."
