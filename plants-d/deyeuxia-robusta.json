    "intro": "Deyeuxia robusta, commonly known as the robust flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-sided spikelets. Deyeuxia robusta is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
