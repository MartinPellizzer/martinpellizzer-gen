    "intro": "Danthonia viscidula, commonly known as sticky danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its adaptability and ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
