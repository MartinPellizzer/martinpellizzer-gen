    "intro": "Danthonia nardifolia, commonly known as the carpet grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It features slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, often carpeting the ground in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically with a bluish-green hue. Danthonia nardifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
