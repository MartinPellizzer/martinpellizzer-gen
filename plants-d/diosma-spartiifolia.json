    "intro": "Diosma spartiifolia, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. Diosma spartiifolia is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
