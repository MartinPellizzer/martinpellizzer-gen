    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa var. coreensis, commonly known as the Korean bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, tufted clumps. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
