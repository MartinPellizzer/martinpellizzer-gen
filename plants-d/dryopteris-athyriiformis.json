    "intro": "Dryopteris athyriiformis, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are often covered with a layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The golden shield fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its attractive foliage."
