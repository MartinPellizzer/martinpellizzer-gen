    "intro": "Desmodium procumbens var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed hairy senna, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its seeds are encased in slender, elongated pods, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia. The variety longipes is distinguished by its longer stems and more extensive branching compared to other varieties of Desmodium."
