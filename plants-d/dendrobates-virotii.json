    "intro": "Dendrobates virotii, commonly known as the Virot's poison dart frog, is a brightly colored frog native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dendrobatidae, which includes numerous species of poison dart frogs known for their vibrant skin patterns and toxic secretions. The species is characterized by its distinctive coloration, often featuring a combination of yellow, orange, and black markings. Its habitat consists of humid, leaf-littered forest floors near streams, where it lays its eggs. The frog's skin secretes a potent toxin, which it uses for defense against predators."
