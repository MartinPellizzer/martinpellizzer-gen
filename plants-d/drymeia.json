    "intro": "Drymeia, commonly known as the bluebell or bluebottle, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Drymeia species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They have finely divided, fern-like leaves that contribute to their ornamental appeal. The fruit is a small, dry schizocarp that splits into two one-seeded parts when mature."
