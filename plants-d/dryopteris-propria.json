    "intro": "Dryopteris propria, commonly known as the brittle bladder fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and can spread to form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
