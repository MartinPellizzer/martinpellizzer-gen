    "intro": "Diospyros pterocalycina, commonly known as the white star gooseberry, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, yellow-orange fruits resembling small cherries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense tropical forests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine by Indigenous communities."
