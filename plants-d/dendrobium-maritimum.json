    "intro": "Dendrobium maritimum, commonly known as the sea orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to coastal regions of southern and eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, adapting to saline and windy conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Dendrobium maritimum is valued for its ecological role in coastal ecosystems and its ornamental appeal."
