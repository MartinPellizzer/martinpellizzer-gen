    "intro": "Doronicum pyrolifolium, commonly known as the Pyrolaleaf leopard's bane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
