    "intro": "Dennstaedtia apiifolia var. dissecta, commonly known as the divided shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern that exhibits distinctive leaf morphology. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with deeply dissected segments that give the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The leaves are usually green, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds."
