    "intro": "Dendrobium foetens, commonly known as the stinking orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, wiry stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Dendrobium foetens is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological significance."
