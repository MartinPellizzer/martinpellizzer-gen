    "intro": "Decaspermum cambodianum, commonly known as the Cambodian decasperm, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Cambodia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are often greenish-white in color. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
