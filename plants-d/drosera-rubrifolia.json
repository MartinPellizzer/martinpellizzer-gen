    "intro": "Drosera rubrifolia, commonly known as the red-leaf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its red-tinged foliage gives it its common name, and it blooms with small, pinkish-white flowers during the warmer months. Drosera rubrifolia is a low-growing species that thrives in cool, humid conditions."
