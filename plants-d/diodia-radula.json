    "intro": "Diodia radula, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Diodia radula is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water availability."
