    "intro": "Dalbergia peguensis, commonly known as Burmese rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its beauty and durability. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
