    "intro": "Dryorkis tridris, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves and delicate, fragrant blooms. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers, which typically bloom in late spring, come in shades of white and pale pink, adding a unique aesthetic to its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
