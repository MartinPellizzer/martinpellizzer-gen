    "intro": "Dubautia rockii, commonly known as the Hawaiian rock dudleya, is a succulent plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dubautia rockii is considered a rare and endangered species."
