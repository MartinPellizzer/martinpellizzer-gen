    "intro": "Diplobryum, commonly known as the double leaf liverwort, is a genus of non-vascular plants belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its leaf-like structures that are typically two-ranked and closely appressed to the substrate. These plants thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil surfaces. Diplobryum species are typically small, with a simple morphology and lack true roots, stems, or leaves in the traditional sense. They play an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as indicators of environmental conditions."
