    "intro": "Draba alba, commonly known as the white rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in a raceme. Draba alba thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and flies."
