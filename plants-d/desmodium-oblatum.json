    "intro": "Desmodium oblatum, commonly known as the flatleaf burr legume, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often heart-shaped and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Desmodium oblatum is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural settings."
