    "intro": "Dianthus crassipes, commonly known as sea pink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe, North Africa, and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of pink or reddish-pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salty, wind-swept environments. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Dianthus crassipes is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
