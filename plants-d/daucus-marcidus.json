    "intro": "Daucus marcidus, commonly known as the slender carrot, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Its roots are typically small and not as economically valuable as those of the common carrot. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
