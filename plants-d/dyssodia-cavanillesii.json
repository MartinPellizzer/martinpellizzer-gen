    "intro": "Dyssodia cavanillesii, commonly known as the Desert Bells, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of individual blooms. The plant features gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically pink to purple, with ray florets that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dyssodia cavanillesii is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
