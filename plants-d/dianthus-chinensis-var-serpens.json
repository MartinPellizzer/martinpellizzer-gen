It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is native to China and Korea. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
