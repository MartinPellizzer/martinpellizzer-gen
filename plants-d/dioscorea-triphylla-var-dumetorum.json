    "intro": "Dioscorea triphylla var. dumetorum, commonly known as the African arrowroot or wild yam, is a climbing perennial vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and tuberous roots. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its tubers are used in traditional medicine and as a food source, though they contain toxic compounds that require careful processing. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in its native habitats."
