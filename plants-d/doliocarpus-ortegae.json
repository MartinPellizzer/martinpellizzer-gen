    "intro": "Doliocarpus ortegae, commonly known as the Ortegae's doliocarpus, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family, native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its botanical significance lies in its potential ecological role and possible medicinal properties, though it remains relatively understudied."
