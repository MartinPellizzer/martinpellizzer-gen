    "intro": "Deparia pseudoconilii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round interest in woodland gardens."
