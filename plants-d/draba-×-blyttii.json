    "intro": "Draba \u00d7 blyttii, commonly known as the Alpine winter cress, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, where it is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Draba \u00d7 blyttii plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky and mountainous regions and is an important part of the local flora in its native habitat."
