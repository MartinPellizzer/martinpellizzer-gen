    "intro": "Dryopteris gongylodes var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern Asia. It features fronds that are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside of the leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from sporangia clustered in sori on the fertile fronds. The hirsute (hairy) appearance of the fronds is a key identifying characteristic of this variety."
