    "intro": "Dalbergaria, commonly known as the ironwood or dalbergia genus, is a group of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their woody stems and compound leaves. Many species produce small, pea-like flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. The fruits are legumes, containing several seeds, and the plants are adapted to a variety of climates, including arid and tropical regions. Dalbergaria species are valued for their hard, durable wood and are sometimes used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants."
