    "intro": "Danais aptera, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its fruit is a spherical berry that turns from green to red as it matures, containing several seeds. Due to its hairy foliage and toxic compounds, it is often avoided by herbivores and can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
