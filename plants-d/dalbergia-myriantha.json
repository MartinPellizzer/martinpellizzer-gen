    "intro": "Dalbergia myriantha, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood that is highly valued for furniture and musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a pod containing several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils with adequate sunlight. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
