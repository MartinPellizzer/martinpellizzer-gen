    "intro": "Davallia triloba, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically dark green with a finely serrated edge. The plant features rhizomes that grow horizontally, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. It prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique, feathery appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in both indoor and outdoor settings."
