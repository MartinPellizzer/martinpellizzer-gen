    "intro": "Dianthus obtusifolius, commonly known as the blunt-leaved campion, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a blunt or rounded tip, giving it its common name. Dianthus obtusifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
