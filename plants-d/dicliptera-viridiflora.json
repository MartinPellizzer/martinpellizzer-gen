It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense spikelets, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
