    "intro": "Dracaena regalis, commonly known as the royal dracaena, is a striking evergreen plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 10 meters in height, adorned with long, narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its succulent-like leaves store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for indoor cultivation. Dracaena regalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities."
