    "intro": "Dryopteris qinyuanensis, commonly known as the Qinyuan shield fern, is a rare species of shield fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a broad, shield-shaped outline. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia clustered on the underside. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
