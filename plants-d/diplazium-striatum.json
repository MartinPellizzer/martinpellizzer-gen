    "intro": "Diplazium striatum, commonly known as the broadleaf hawksbeard, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, producing a dense clump of dark green, leathery, lance-shaped leaves. The plant's fronds are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
