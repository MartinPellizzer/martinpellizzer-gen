    "intro": "Dendrobium pachyglossum, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, branching growth habit with thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a distinctive lip that is broader than the other petals. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and well-draining potting media. Dendrobium pachyglossum is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
