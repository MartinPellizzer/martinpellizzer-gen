    "intro": "Diospyros orbicularis, commonly known as the round-leaf persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are broadly ovate and often have a waxy texture. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits that mature to a deep orange-red color. The fruit has a sweet, sometimes astringent flavor and is edible when fully ripe. It is valued for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
