    "intro": "Decorsea livida var. meridionalis, commonly known as the southern white sage, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features silvery-gray foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clustered inflorescences during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
