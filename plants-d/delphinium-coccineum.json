    "intro": "Delphinium coccineum, commonly known as the scarlet larkspur, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of strikingly colorful, spurred flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, while its flowers are borne in dense spikes at the top of the plant. Delphinium coccineum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
