    "intro": "Deschampsia flexuosa f. legei, commonly known as the creeping hairgrass, is a variant of the common hairgrass species. It is a low-growing, perennial grass that typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground. This form is characterized by its prostrate or decumbent stems, which help it spread across rocky or sandy soils. The leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a common sight in alpine and arctic regions."
