    "intro": "Dryopteris plurifolia, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its feather-like fronds that are typically divided into multiple pinnae, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round interest in woodland gardens."
