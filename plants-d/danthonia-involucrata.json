    "intro": "Danthonia involucrata, commonly known as the slender feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets that are often hidden within the leaf sheaths. Danthonia involucrata plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
