    "intro": "Dichorisandra radicalis, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Dichorisandra, is a tropical aquatic plant native to regions of Africa. It features floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom above the water surface. Its root system is adapted for aquatic environments, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Dichorisandra radicalis is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
