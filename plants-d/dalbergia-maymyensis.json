It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces hard, dark wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It typically grows in lowland evergreen forests and is often found in humid, tropical climates. Due to its rarity and demand, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
