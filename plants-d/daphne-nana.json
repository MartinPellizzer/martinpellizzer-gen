    "intro": "Daphne nana, commonly known as dwarf daphne, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, compact foliage with glossy dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or lilac, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. Its compact form makes it ideal for rock gardens or as a border plant. Daphne nana is relatively hardy but requires well-drained soil and protection from strong winds."
