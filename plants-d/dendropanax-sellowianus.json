It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with elongated, arrow-shaped lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
