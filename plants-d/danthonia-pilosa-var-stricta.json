    "intro": "Danthonia pilosa var. stricta, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
