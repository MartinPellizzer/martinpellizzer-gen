    "intro": "Dicksonia japonica, commonly known as the Japanese tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Japan and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizome that serves as a storage organ and supports the growth of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which helps attract pollinators."
