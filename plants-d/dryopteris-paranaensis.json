    "intro": "Dryopteris paranaensis, commonly known as the Parana shield fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, shield-like pattern. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
