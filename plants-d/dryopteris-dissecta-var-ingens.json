It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters, with a distinctive, deeply divided, and often arching appearance. The fronds are typically bright green, with a leathery texture and a prominent midrib. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in cool, humid climates."
