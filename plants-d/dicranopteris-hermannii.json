    "intro": "Dicranopteris hermannii, commonly known as the Hermann's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental aquatic gardens. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Dicranopteris hermannii plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
