    "intro": "Daphnopsis longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-peduncled daphnopsis, is a member of the Ericaceae family. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its ornamental value comes from its compact form and seasonal color changes in its leaves. It is native to regions of South America, particularly in the Andes."
