    "intro": "Dendrobium mambo, commonly known as the mambo orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Dendrobium mambo is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
