It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in its propagation. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and seed dispersal research."
