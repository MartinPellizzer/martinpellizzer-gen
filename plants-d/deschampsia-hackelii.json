    "intro": "Deschampsia hackelii, commonly known as Hackel's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and feathery plumes that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Deschampsia hackelii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
