    "intro": "Diorimasperma, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its small, pale flowers that appear to glow in low light, giving it its ethereal appearance. It has a unique growth habit, often growing in dense clusters with a fibrous root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Diorimasperma remains a subject of scientific curiosity and conservation interest."
