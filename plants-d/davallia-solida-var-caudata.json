    "intro": "Davallia solida var. caudata, commonly known as the hairy Davallia, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, hairy tissue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing a lush, green appearance throughout the year."
