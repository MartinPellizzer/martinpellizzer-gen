    "intro": "Davallia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that vary in shape and size depending on light conditions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow in the dark, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
