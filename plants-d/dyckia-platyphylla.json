    "intro": "Dyckia platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with showy, red-orange flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dyckia platyphylla is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
