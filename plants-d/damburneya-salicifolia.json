    "intro": "Damburneya salicifolia, commonly known as the silky damburneya, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky white or greyish down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which appear in late winter to early spring. Its foliage remains lush throughout the year, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Damburneya salicifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or forested areas of New Zealand."
