    "intro": "Dichapetalum glomeratum, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
