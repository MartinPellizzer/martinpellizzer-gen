    "intro": "Dryopteris leprieurii var. minor, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a compact evergreen fern native to Japan. It features fronds that are typically divided into smaller, shield-shaped segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
