    "intro": "Dioon holmgrenii, commonly known as the Mexican star cactus, is a species of cycad native to the southern United States and Mexico. It is characterized by its short, thick trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green and leathery. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
