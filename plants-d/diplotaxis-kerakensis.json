    "intro": "Diplotaxis kerakensis, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal. Diplotaxis kerakensis is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
