    "intro": "Dalbergia grandidieri, commonly known as the Madagascar rosewood, is a rare and endangered tree native to the eastern rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and acoustic properties. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by winged fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to overexploitation and habitat loss, it is critically endangered and protected under international conservation laws."
