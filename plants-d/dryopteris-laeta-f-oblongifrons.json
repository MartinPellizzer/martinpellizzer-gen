    "intro": "Dryopteris laeta f. oblongifrons, commonly known as the shining wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to eastern North America. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, ovate pinnae that give the plant a lush, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The plant's rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time."
