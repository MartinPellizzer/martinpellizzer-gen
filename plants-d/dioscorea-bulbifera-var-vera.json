    "intro": "Dioscorea bulbifera var. vera, commonly known as the air potato, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and its unique ability to produce aerial tubers, which grow from the stems. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed or tropical forest environments. Its tubers, while edible when properly prepared, contain toxic compounds that require careful processing. The species is also notable for its rapid growth and invasive potential in certain regions."
