    "intro": "Diplazium tamandarei, commonly known as the Tamandare sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its long, strap-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new growth along their length, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
