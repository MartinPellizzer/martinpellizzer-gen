    "intro": "Dendrobium diaphanum, commonly known as the translucent orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its slender, cane-like stems and clusters of small, pale green or white flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Due to its delicate appearance and unique flowering pattern, it is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
