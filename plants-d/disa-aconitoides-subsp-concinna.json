    "intro": "Disa aconitoides subsp. concinna, commonly known as the blue disa, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
