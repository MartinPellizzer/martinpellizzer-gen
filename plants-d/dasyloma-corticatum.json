    "intro": "Dasyloma corticatum, commonly known as the bark lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives on bark surfaces in temperate and boreal forests. It has a distinctive, crust-like thallus with a dark, leathery texture and a pale, powdery upper surface. The lichen contains a mixture of algae and fungi, with the fungal component providing structural support and the algal partner conducting photosynthesis. It is often found on the trunks of coniferous trees, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling and habitat provision for microorganisms. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for forest health."
