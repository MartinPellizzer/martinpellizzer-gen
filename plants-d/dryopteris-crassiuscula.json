    "intro": "Dryopteris crassiuscula, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and segmented, allowing it to spread vegetatively through stolons. The fronds are biennial, with fertile fronds appearing in the second year, producing spores on the underside of the leaves."
