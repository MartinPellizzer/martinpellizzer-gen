It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. While not widely cultivated, it is valued for its ornamental beauty and has limited use in traditional herbal medicine."
