    "intro": "Diuris sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur-crested orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow to orange flower spikes, which bear several small, lance-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly wasps, due to their specialized structure and scent. Diuris sulphurea is a short-lived perennial, often flowering in spring and early summer."
