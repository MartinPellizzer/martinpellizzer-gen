    "intro": "Dissiliaria tuckeri, commonly known as the Tucker's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale greenish-white flowers that resemble spectral forms. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them, instead relying on its specialized roots for absorption. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with intricate structures that facilitate pollination by specific insect species. Due to its restricted habitat and habitat degradation, Dissiliaria tuckeri is considered critically endangered."
