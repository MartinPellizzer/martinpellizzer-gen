    "intro": "Dryopteris thomassetii, commonly known as the Thomasset's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and the spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the pinnae. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
