    "intro": "Dryandra ashbyi, commonly known as the Ashby's dryandra, is a rare and striking member of the Proteaceae family native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its unique, urn-shaped flowerheads that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or orange center. The plant typically grows in heathlands and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, a common trait among members of its family. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is often cultivated in conservation programs to ensure its survival."
