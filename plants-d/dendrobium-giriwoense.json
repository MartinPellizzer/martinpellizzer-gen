    "intro": "Dendrobium giriwoense, commonly known as the Giriwoen orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces inflorescences with multiple fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
