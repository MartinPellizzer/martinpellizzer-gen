    "intro": "Deschampsia philippii, commonly known as Philippi's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that turns reddish in the fall. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
