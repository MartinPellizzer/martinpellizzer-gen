    "intro": "Disporum sessile var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is often found in understory habitats where it contributes to soil stabilization and biodiversity."
