    "intro": "Daucus sahariensis, commonly known as the Saharan carrot, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are finely divided and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The fruit is a small, dry schizocarp that splits into two halves when mature, a common feature in the Apiaceae family."
