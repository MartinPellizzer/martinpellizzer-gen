    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa var. minor, commonly known as bluegrass or fine leaf bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green leaves and forms dense, tufted clumps. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. It has a short root system and is relatively low-growing, reaching heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
