    "intro": "Dalea californica, commonly known as California milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Dalea californica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
