    "intro": "Dendrochilum abbreviatum var. remiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tree orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific tropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, tree-like growth habit with elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
