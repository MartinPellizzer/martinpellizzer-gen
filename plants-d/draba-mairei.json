    "intro": "Draba mairei, commonly known as the Alpine whitlow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Draba mairei has basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing clusters of pale yellow to white flowers."
