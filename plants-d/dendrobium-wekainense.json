    "intro": "Dendrobium wekainense, commonly known as the Wekainense orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinct fragrance. It blooms during the wet season, producing clusters of small, showy flowers. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
