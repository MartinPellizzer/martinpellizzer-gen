    "intro": "Dieffenbachia picta, commonly known as the ZZ plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with dark green leaves speckled with white and yellow markings. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture, making it highly tolerant of low-light conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are rarely seen in cultivation. Dieffenbachia picta is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor environments."
