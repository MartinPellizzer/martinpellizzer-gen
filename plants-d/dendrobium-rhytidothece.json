    "intro": "Dendrobium rhytidothece, commonly known as the waxy leech orchid, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, wiry stems covered in a thick, waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Its flowers are typically white or pale green with a yellow lip, and they bloom in summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
