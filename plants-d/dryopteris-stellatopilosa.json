    "intro": "Dryopteris stellatopilosa, commonly known as the starry shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright green fronds that are covered in small, star-shaped spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its fronds are leathery and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Dryopteris stellatopilosa is valued in horticulture for its attractive appearance and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
