It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its pinnate leaves and striking red or orange flowers. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental species in warmer climates. Its botanical features make it both ecologically and horticulturally significant in its native habitat."
