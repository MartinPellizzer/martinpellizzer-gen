    "intro": "Draba funckiana, commonly known as the Funck's whitlow grass, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats close to the ground. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Draba funckiana is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high elevations where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
