It is a small, herbaceous plant with a distinctive rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in woodlands or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
