    "intro": "Dryopteris hieronymusii, commonly known as the Hieronymus' wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
