    "intro": "Deuterocohnia meziana var. carmineoviridiflora, commonly known as the Carmine-green Flora Candelabra, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure with tightly packed, fleshy leaves that are typically a mix of green and red hues. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that range from carmine to green, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its unique coloration and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
