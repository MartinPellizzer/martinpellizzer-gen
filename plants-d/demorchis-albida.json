    "intro": "Demorchis albida, commonly known as the white orchid, is a species of orchid native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling small, elegant blossoms. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, meaning it grows in segments rather than from a single stem. Its leaves are typically elongated and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture. Demorchis albida is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
