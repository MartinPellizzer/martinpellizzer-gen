It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. Delphinium distichum is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
