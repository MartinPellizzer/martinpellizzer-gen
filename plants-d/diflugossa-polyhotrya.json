    "intro": "Diflugossa polyhotrya, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive star-shaped appearance, which sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often on rocky slopes or in shaded forest understories. Its flowers bloom during the late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Diflugossa polyhotrya is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
