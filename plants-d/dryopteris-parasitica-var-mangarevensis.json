    "intro": "Dryopteris parasitica var. mangarevensis, commonly known as the Mangareva water fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the tropical island of Mangareva in French Polynesia. It is a polypod fern characterized by its delicate, water-filled fronds that resemble floating leaves, adapted to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The plant exhibits a specialized morphology with a short, creeping rhizome and compound fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an important species for botanical studies and conservation efforts."
