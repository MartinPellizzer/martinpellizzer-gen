It is characterized by its woody stems and broad, palmate leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers with five petals, which are followed by distinctive, berry-like fruits. These fruits are edible and contain numerous seeds enclosed in a fleshy, yellowish pulp. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
