    "intro": "Danaea zamiopsis, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a tropical evergreen plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Marantaceae and is characterized by its striking, shield-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant yellow or orange. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves. Danaea zamiopsis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and ability to add a tropical flair to indoor spaces."
