    "intro": "Dolichothele melaleuca, commonly known as the broad-faced funnel-web spider, is a species of mygalomorph spider found in Australia. It is characterized by its robust, hairy body and a distinctive, broad-faced appearance. The spider's web is typically a complex, funnel-shaped structure used for hunting. It is often found in moist environments such as under rocks, logs, or in dense vegetation. The plant name may be a misnomer, as the species is not a plant but a spider."
