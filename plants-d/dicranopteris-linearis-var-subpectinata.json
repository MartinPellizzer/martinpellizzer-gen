    "intro": "Dicranopteris linearis var. subpectinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its linear, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving streams and rice paddies. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
