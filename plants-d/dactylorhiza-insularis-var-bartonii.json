    "intro": "Dactylorhiza insularis var. bartonii, commonly known as the island lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, dark green to brownish-green leaves and its distinctive inflorescence of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It is a terrestrial orchid with a short rhizome and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
