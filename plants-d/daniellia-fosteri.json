    "intro": "Daniellia fosteri, commonly known as the Foster's Daniellia, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Daniellia fosteri is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
