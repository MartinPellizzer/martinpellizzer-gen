    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata subsp. rigida, commonly known as rigid cocksfoot, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its stiff, erect stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and pastures. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, contributing to its hardiness. This subspecies is valued for its forage quality and is used in agricultural settings for livestock grazing."
