It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that resemble a beak, hence its common name. It produces small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
