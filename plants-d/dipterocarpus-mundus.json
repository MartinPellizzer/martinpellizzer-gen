    "intro": "Dipterocarpus mundus, commonly known as the white ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its hard, heavy wood and large, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, lowland rainforests and plays a significant role in the ecological structure of these ecosystems. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is often threatened by deforestation and overharvesting."
