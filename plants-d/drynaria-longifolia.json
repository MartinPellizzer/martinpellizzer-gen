    "intro": "Drynaria longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Drynariaceae. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizome is thick and woody, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Drynaria longifolia is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
