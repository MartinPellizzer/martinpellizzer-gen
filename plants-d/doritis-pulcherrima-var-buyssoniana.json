    "intro": "Doritis pulcherrima var. buyssoniana, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mangrove swamps or along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it has a unique ability to absorb nutrients through its roots from the surrounding water. Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
