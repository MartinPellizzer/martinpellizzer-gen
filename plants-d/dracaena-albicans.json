    "intro": "Dracaena albicans, commonly known as the white dracaena, is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that are typically a striking white or pale green color, distinguishing it from other dracaena species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red or orange berries, which are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to bright indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
