    "intro": "Dichanthelium appalachiense, commonly known as the Appalachian sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils, often found in open habitats such as sand dunes and pine woodlands. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Dichanthelium appalachiense plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
