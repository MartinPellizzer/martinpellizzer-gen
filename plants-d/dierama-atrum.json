    "intro": "Dierama atrum, commonly known as the black-leaf dierama, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, grass-like stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and silvery white underneath. The plant produces showy, cone-like inflorescences composed of numerous small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Dierama atrum is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
