    "intro": "Decaloba jacquinii, commonly known as the Jacquin's decaloba, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically display a vibrant mix of purple and yellow hues. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its humid, shaded habitat. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Decaloba jacquinii is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized collections due to its rarity in the wild."
