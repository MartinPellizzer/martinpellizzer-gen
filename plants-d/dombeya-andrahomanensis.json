It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow center. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
