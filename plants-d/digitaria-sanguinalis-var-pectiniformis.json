    "intro": "Digitaria sanguinalis var. pectiniformis, commonly known as hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Hairy bluestem is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
