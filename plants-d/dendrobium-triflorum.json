    "intro": "Dendrobium triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Dendrobium triflorum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
