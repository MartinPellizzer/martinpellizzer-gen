    "intro": "Dioscorea macrostachya var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered yam, is a perennial vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and tuberous roots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically sessile, meaning they lack stalks. Its tubers are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures. The species is valued for its ornamental potential as well as its practical uses."
