    "intro": "Dolomiaea forrestii, commonly known as the Forster's dolomiaea, is a rare and striking member of the Aizoaceae family. It is native to South Africa, specifically the Western Cape province, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. It is often found in rocky outcrops and mountainous regions, thriving in full sun. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
