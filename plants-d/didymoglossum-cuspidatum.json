    "intro": "Didymoglossum cuspidatum, commonly known as the spiky moss, is a small, cushion-like moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Dicranaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant has short, branching stems covered with small, pointed leaves that give it its common name. It is typically found in temperate regions, often in rocky or forested areas. Due to its delicate structure, it plays a minor but important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
