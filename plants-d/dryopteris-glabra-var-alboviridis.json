    "intro": "Dryopteris glabra var. alboviridis, commonly known as the white-veined wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern characterized by its distinctive silvery-white veins on its fronds. It is a perennial fern native to eastern North America, typically found in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant features bipinnate fronds that are upright and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus. The varietal name \"alboviridis\" refers to its pale green to white veins, setting it apart from other varieties of the species."
