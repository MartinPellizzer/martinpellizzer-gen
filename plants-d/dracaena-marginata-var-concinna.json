    "intro": "Dracaena marginata var. concinna, commonly known as the Madagascar dragon tree, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It features a slender, upright stem with a distinctive red or purple hue at the base, often with a whitish or yellowish tinge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a waxy texture with a pale green to yellowish margin. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
