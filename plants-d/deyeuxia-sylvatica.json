    "intro": "Deyeuxia sylvatica, commonly known as the woodland false grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in association with other wetland plants. Deyeuxia sylvatica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
