    "intro": "Dioscorea moyobambensis, commonly known as the Yungas yam, is a climbing vine native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary storage organs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and usually greenish-white in color. The tubers of D. moyobambensis are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some indigenous communities."
