    "intro": "Dermatophlebium cristatum, commonly known as the crested fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive, crisped fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. The botanical features of Dermatophlebium cristatum make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
