It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, and it produces small, dry fruits called capsules.
