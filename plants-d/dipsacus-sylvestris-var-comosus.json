    "intro": "Dipsacus sylvestris var. comosus, commonly known as the common teasel, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, bristly stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, spiky flower heads that are typically purple or pink in color, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in woodland edges. Its unique structure and historical use in the textile industry make it a notable botanical species."
