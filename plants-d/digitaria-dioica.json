    "intro": "Digitaria dioica, commonly known as cockspur grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is a warm-season perennial grass that typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant has both male and female inflorescences, which are separate on different plants, a characteristic known as dioecy. Its seed heads are distinctive, featuring bristly, spikelike structures that give it its common name. Digitaria dioica is also known for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
