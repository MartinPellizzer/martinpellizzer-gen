    "intro": "Dossifluga suborbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded thallus that is typically green or reddish in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture through its surface. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in specialized leaf-like structures called gemma cups. Dossifluga suborbicularis plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
