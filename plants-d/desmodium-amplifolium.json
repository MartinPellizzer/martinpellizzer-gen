    "intro": "Desmodium amplifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf desmodium, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often broad and heart-shaped, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Desmodium amplifolium is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
