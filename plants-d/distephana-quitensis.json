    "intro": "Distephana quitensis, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling bells, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool and sunny conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are often hairy and erect. Distephana quitensis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological importance in its native habitat."
