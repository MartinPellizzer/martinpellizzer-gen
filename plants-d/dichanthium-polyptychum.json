    "intro": "Dichanthium polyptychum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stargrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
