    "intro": "Deinbollia cauliflora, commonly known as the climbing hibiscus, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red. The plant exhibits cauliflorous growth, meaning its flowers and fruits develop directly from the stem rather than the leaves. Its leaves are ovate and have a rough, hairy texture, while the flowers are often accompanied by prominent stamens. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
