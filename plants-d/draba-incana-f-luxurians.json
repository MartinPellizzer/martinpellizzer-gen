It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is typically found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are usually hairy and arranged in a rosette, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. This subspecies is noted for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
