    "intro": "Dioscorea dendrotricha, commonly known as the tree yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by cylindrical, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. Its tubers, which are the primary part used by humans, are rich in starch and have been traditionally used as a food source. However, the plant contains toxic compounds and requires careful processing before consumption."
