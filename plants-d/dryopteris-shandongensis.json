    "intro": "Dryopteris shandongensis, commonly known as the Shandong wood fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to eastern China. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive pinnae arrangement. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
