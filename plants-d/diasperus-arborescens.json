    "intro": "Diasperus arborescens, commonly known as the tree spurge, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Diasperus arborescens is also known for its latex, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine."
