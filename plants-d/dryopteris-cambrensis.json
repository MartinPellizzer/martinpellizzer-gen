    "intro": "Dryopteris cambrensis, commonly known as the Welsh wood fern, is a species of fern native to western Europe, particularly Wales and parts of southern England. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that often have a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland areas, thriving in acidic soils. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Dryopteris cambrensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
