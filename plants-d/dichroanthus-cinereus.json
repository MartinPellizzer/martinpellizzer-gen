    "intro": "Dichroanthus cinereus, commonly known as the gray dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers that transition to white as they age, a feature that gives it its common name. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, grayish hairs. Dichroanthus cinereus thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks."
