    "intro": "Dracaena linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dracaena, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow, dark green leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though it is more valued for its ornamental foliage than its flowering. It is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Dracaena linearifolia is often used as a houseplant due to its ability to tolerate a range of indoor conditions."
