    "intro": "Dioscorea palmata, commonly known as the palmate yam, is a herbaceous perennial vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its tuberous roots are the primary part used, though they are not as economically important as those of other yam species. Dioscorea palmata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and thickets."
