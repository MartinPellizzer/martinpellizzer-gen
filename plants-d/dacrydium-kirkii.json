    "intro": "Dacrydium kirkii, commonly known as the New Zealand mountain pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Southern Alps of New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its dense, needle-like foliage that is typically dark green. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Dacrydium kirkii thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in the region's flora."
