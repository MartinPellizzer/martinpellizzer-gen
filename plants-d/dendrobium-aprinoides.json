    "intro": "Dendrobium aprinoides, commonly known as the apricot orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a distinctive apricot-like hue. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in horticulture."
