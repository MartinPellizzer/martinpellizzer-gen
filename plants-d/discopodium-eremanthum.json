    "intro": "Discopodium eremanthum, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance.
