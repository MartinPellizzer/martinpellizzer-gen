    "intro": "Dryopolystichum, commonly known as the rock holly fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their compact, evergreen fronds that often grow in dense clusters on rocky or shaded terrain. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, upright growth habit. They possess a rhizomatous structure that allows them to spread and form dense colonies. Dryopolystichum species are well adapted to moist, acidic soils and are often found in temperate and subtropical regions."
