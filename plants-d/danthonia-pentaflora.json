    "intro": "Danthonia pentaflora, commonly known as the five-flowered grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form a low, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale blue flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Danthonia pentaflora is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
