    "intro": "Dichocarpum adiantifolium var. adiantifolium, commonly known as the fern-like bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that resemble those of a fern. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is relatively rare in cultivation."
