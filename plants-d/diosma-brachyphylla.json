    "intro": "Diosma brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved diosma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters. Diosma brachyphylla is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
