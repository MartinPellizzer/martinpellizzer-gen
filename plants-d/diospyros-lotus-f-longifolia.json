    "intro": "Diospyros lotus f. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved persimmon, is a botanical variant of the persimmon species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often longer than they are wide. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into edible, sweet fruits with a distinctive orange-red color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. This form is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its fruit, which is commonly consumed fresh or used in culinary applications."
