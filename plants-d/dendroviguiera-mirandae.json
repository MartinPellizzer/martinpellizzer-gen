    "intro": "Dendroviguiera mirandae, commonly known as the Mirandense tree, is a rare and endemic plant species native to a restricted area in Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive foliage. The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically displaying a pale yellow to greenish hue, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dendroviguiera mirandae is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental degradation."
