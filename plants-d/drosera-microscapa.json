    "intro": "Drosera microscapa, commonly known as the miniature sundew, is a small carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its tiny, sticky glands that secrete a sugary dew to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are small and clustered, with each leaf bearing numerous glandular hairs. Drosera microscapa is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological interest."
