    "intro": "Doryopteris decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Doryopteris decipiens is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
