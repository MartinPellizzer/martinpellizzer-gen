    "intro": "Deiregyne sheviakiana, commonly known as the Shewiak mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. The plant is characterized by its small, white to pale blue florets arranged in a daisy-like pattern, with a central disk of yellow flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
