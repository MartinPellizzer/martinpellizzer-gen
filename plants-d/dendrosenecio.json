    "intro": "Dendrosenecio, commonly known as the African snowbells, is a genus of flowering plants native to South Africa. These plants are characterized by their rosette-forming leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. They belong to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and are known for their striking white or yellow petals. Dendrosenecio species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens due to their unique appearance and resilience. However, many species are threatened by habitat loss and over-collection, making conservation efforts essential for their survival."
