It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in coastal and lowland areas. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
