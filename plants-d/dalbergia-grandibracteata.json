    "intro": "Dalbergia grandibracteata, commonly known as the giant legume or giant dalbergia, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree produces long, slender pods that contain flat, dark seeds. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
