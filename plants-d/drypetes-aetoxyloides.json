    "intro": "Drypetes aetoxyloides, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered in many regions."
