    "intro": "Diplecthrum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered water fern, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged or floating near the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Due to its delicate structure and habitat preferences, it plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
