    "intro": "Dryopteris wacketii, commonly known as the Wacket's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
