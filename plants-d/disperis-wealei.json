    "intro": "Disperis wealei, commonly known as the Weale's orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant is known for its unique floral structure, featuring a specialized lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Disperis wealei thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
