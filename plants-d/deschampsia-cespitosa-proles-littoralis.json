    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa proles littoralis, commonly known as coastal bluegrass, is a grass species adapted to coastal environments. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and forms dense, compact clumps. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. It has a shallow root system that helps stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
