    "intro": "Dryopteris fischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
