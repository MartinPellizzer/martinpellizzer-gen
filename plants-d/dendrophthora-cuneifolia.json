    "intro": "Dendrophthora cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees. It has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers, which are often clustered in small inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Dendrophthora cuneifolia plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the ecological balance of its host trees."
