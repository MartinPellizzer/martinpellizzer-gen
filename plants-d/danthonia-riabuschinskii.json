    "intro": "Danthonia riabuschinskii, commonly known as the Siberian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and tufted growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, arctic environments. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, fluffy inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to low temperatures and strong winds. Danthonia riabuschinskii plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine and tundra ecosystems."
