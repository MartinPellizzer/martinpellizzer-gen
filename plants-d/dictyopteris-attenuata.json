    "intro": "Dictyopteris attenuata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea holly, is a species of marine algae belonging to the family Dictyopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm long and have a distinctive, branched structure. This algae thrives in shallow, coastal waters, often found on rocky substrates in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, rounded clusters along the fronds. Dictyopteris attenuata plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
