    "intro": "Disynaphia variolata, commonly known as the variable disynaphia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered umbels of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp, which splits into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. Disynaphia variolata is often found in the eastern United States, where it thrives in rich, loamy soils."
