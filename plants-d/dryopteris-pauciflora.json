    "intro": "Dryopteris pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris pauciflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
