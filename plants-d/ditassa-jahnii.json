    "intro": "Ditassa jahnii, commonly known as the Jahnii dittany, is a rare and elusive plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ditassa jahnii is considered a conservation concern."
