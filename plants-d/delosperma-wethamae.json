    "intro": "Delosperma wethamae, commonly known as the Wethamae ice plant, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
