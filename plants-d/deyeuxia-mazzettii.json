    "intro": "Deyeuxia mazzettii, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Asia, particularly in Tibet and Nepal. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silky foliage that resembles a plume. The plant typically thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, where it forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers. Deyeuxia mazzettii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its delicate, wind-swaying appearance."
