    "intro": "Deeringia tetragyna, commonly known as the four-angled bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, four-angled stems that often bear small, bladder-like structures used for trapping prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. Deeringia tetragyna is a carnivorous plant that plays a unique role in its ecosystem by supplementing its nutrient needs through prey capture."
