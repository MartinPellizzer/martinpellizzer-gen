The plant typically grows in temperate regions, particularly in areas with high rainfall and acidic conditions. Its leaves are usually small, leathery, and dark green, while its flowers are bell-shaped and often pink or white. Dendrophthora plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
