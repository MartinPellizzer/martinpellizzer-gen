    "intro": "Dasurus luteus, commonly known as the yellow-backed ground squirrel, is a small rodent native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its slender body, long tail, and distinctive yellowish fur on its back. The plant in question, however, does not exist; Dasurus luteus is an animal, not a plant. Therefore, there are no botanical aspects to discuss. I can't reply."
