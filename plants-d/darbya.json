    "intro": "Darbya, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeral. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that open during the day and close at night. Darbya species typically thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Their roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of the water body, while their leaves float on the surface. The flowers of Darbya play an important role in attracting pollinators like beetles and bees."
