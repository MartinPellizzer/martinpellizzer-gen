    "intro": "Dendrobium comatum var. papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of New Guinea and nearby islands. It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces long, pendant inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a dense layer of white, velvety hair, which helps in moisture retention. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
