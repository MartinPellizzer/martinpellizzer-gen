    "intro": "Desmodium blandum, commonly known as smallleaf desmodium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. Desmodium blandum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
