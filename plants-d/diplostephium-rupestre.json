    "intro": "Diplostephium rupestre, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, clustered leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in crevices or on slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in drought-prone areas."
