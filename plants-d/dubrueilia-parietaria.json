    "intro": "Dubrueilia parietaria, commonly known as the wall goosefoot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in dry, sunny environments such as cliffs and walls. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are usually heart-shaped or ovate, with a rough texture. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters and producing small, three-lobed fruits. Dubrueilia parietaria is often used in horticulture for its ability to stabilize soil and its ornamental value in rock gardens."
