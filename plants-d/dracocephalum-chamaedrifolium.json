    "intro": "Dracocephalum chamaedrifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered with dense, blue-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, arranged in spikes at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
