It is a low-growing perennial with dense clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
