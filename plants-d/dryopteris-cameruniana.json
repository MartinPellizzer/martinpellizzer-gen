    "intro": "Dryopteris cameruniana, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of fern native to Africa, particularly in regions such as Cameroon and Nigeria. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, glossy appearance. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in tropical regions."
