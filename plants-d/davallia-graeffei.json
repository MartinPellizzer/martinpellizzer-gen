    "intro": "Davallia graeffei, commonly known as the silver-veined hoya, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive silvery vein pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Davallia graeffei is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
