    "intro": "Dendrochilum vestitum, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in shaded, moist conditions. The flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat."
