    "intro": "Dodecatheon clevelandii subsp. insulare, commonly known as the San Clemente dodecatheon, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found exclusively on the island of San Clemente in California. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and coastal scrub. Its leaves are lanceolate and hairy, while its stems are erect and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
