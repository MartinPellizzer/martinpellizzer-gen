    "intro": "Dryopteris blanfordii subsp. blanfordii, commonly known as the Blanford's wood fern, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and parts of the Himalayas. It is a perennial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and large, deeply lobed fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
