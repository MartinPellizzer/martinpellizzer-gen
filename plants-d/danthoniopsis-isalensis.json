    "intro": "Danthoniopsis isalensis, commonly known as the Isla grass, is a perennial grass species native to the island of Isla de la Juventud in Cuba. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or dune environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Danthoniopsis isalensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
