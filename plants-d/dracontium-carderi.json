    "intro": "Dracontium carderi, commonly known as the golden arrow plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy texture. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered around the spadix, while the spathe often displays vibrant colors. Dracontium carderi is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid environments."
