    "intro": "Delphinium peregrinum var. obcordatum, commonly known as the Alpine larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly woolly texture, which helps protect the plant from harsh alpine conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils."
