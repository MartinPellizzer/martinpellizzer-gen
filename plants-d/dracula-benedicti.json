    "intro": "Dracula benedicti, commonly known as the Benedict's Dracula, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers and intricate, spathate bracts that resemble the petals of a flower. The plant grows epiphytically, meaning it attaches itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
