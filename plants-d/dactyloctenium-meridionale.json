    "intro": "Dactyloctenium meridionale, commonly known as the southern sand mat, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It features a dense mat of prostrate stems with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
