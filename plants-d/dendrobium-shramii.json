    "intro": "Dendrobium shramii, commonly known as the Shram's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, often in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom during the warmer months. Its inflorescence typically consists of several flowers arranged along a single stem. Dendrobium shramii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
