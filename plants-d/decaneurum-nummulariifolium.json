    "intro": "Decaneurum nummulariifolium, commonly known as the silver dollar plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are rounded and resemble silver coins, hence its common name. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
