    "intro": "Dimorphopetalum, commonly known as the two-petaled plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive flowers, which typically have two petals, a feature that gives the genus its scientific name. The plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in parts of Africa and Asia. They often grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Dimorphopetalum species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique floral structures."
