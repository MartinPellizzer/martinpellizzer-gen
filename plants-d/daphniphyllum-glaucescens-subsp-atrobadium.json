    "intro": "Daphniphyllum glaucescens subsp. atrobadium, commonly known as the dark-red daphniphyllum, is a species native to southern China and northern Vietnam. It is a evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often turn a deep red or purplish hue in the autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in horticulture."
