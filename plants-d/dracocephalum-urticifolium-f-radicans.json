It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or blue, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and have a distinctive bitter taste. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
