    "intro": "Dracaena draco var. pendulifolia, commonly known as the Dragon's Blood Tree Variegated, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, narrow trunk and a dense crown of long, drooping, strap-shaped leaves that give it a unique, almost otherworldly appearance. The leaves are typically a mix of green and white or yellow, creating a variegated effect that enhances its ornamental value. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain toxic seeds. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vibrant foliage."
