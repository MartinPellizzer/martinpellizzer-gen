    "intro": "Dipcadi ursulae var. ursulae, commonly known as the Ursula's broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with a fleshy, root-like structure called a haustorium that attaches to the host plant. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in a spike-like arrangement. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions where it can parasitize various grasses and shrubs. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a facultative parasite."
