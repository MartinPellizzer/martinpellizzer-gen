    "intro": "Digitaria adusta var. hackelii, commonly known as blackgrass or velvetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, hairless spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
