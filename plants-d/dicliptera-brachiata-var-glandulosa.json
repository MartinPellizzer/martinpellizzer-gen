    "intro": "Dicliptera brachiata var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular dicliptera, is a tropical grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with prominent glandular structures on the leaf blades, which secrete substances that may deter herbivores. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle with spikelets that are often hairy or glandular. This variant is noted for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
