    "intro": "Dendrophorbium vallecaucanum, commonly known as the Vallecaucan orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on tree trunks or branches, hence its name. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, a feature common in epiphytic orchids. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
