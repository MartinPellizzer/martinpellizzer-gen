    "intro": "Dryopteris leucolepis, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery-white layer of trichomes, giving it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to the soil while absorbing nutrients. The silver fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
