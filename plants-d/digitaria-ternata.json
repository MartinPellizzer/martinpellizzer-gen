    "intro": "Digitaria ternata, commonly known as rough fescue, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spikelets that are often arranged in dense clusters, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides. Digitaria ternata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
