    "intro": "Dryopteris normalis, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright, slender fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped pinnae. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Dryopteris normalis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
