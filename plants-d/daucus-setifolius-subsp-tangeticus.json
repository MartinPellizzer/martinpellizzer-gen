    "intro": "Daucus setifolius subsp. tangeticus, commonly known as the African carrot, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Its root is typically small and not as commercially valuable as other carrots, but it is used in traditional medicine. The subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
