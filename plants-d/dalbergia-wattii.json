    "intro": "Dalbergia wattii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats. Due to its economic value, Dalbergia wattii is also subject to overharvesting and habitat loss, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
