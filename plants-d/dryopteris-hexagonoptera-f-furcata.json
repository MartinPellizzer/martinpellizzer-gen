    "intro": "Dryopteris hexagonoptera f. furcata, commonly known as the forked wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a triangular or ovate shape, and they possess a leathery texture. The sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories across temperate regions."
