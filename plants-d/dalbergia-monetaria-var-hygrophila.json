    "intro": "Dalbergia monetaria var. hygrophila, commonly known as the water mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
