    "intro": "Digitalis alba, commonly known as the white foxglove, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features tall, erect stems that bear tubular, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink. The plant produces a distinctive, spurred shape on its flowers, which is characteristic of the Digitalis genus. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a heart-shaped base and are covered in fine, downy hairs. Digitalis alba contains cardiac glycosides, making it both a valuable medicinal plant and a potent toxin."
