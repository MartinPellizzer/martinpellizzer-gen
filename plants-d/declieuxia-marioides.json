    "intro": "Declieuxia marioides, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a compact, clump-forming grass native to the island of Mauritius. It features slender, green stems that grow close to the ground, often reaching heights of no more than 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in summer, followed by feathery seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in subtropical regions."
