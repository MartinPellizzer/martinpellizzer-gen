    "intro": "Drosera stolonifera subsp. rupicola, commonly known as the rock sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of glandular leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, and it reproduces both vegetatively through stolons and sexually via seeds. Its unique adaptations make it a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
