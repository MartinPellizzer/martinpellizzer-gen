    "intro": "Dimorphanthera amblyornidis var. steinii, commonly known as the Stein's dimorphanthera, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a distinctive hooded labellum and elongated petals. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or mountainous regions with high rainfall. Its leaves are usually broad and elliptical, adapted to capture maximum light in its understory habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
