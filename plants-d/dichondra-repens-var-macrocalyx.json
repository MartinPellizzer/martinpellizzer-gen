    "intro": "Dichondra repens var. macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered dichondra, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial groundcover plant native to parts of South America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its rapid growth and dense coverage make it useful for erosion control and as a decorative ground cover. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, thriving in temperate climates."
