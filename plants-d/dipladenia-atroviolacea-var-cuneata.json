    "intro": "Dipladenia atroviolacea var. cuneata, commonly known as the dark viola dipladenia, is a hybrid plant in the morning glory family (Convolvulaceae). It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from deep purple to nearly black. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a glossy texture, while the stems are covered in fine, hairy hairs. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in hanging baskets and as a climbing plant in gardens. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
