    "intro": "Dryopteris microtricha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
