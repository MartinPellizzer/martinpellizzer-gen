    "intro": "Dryopteris perrigida, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a deciduous fern native to Asia, particularly found in regions of China, Japan, and Korea. It features elegant, arching fronds with a distinctive silvery-white underside, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-rich soil. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, delicate pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
