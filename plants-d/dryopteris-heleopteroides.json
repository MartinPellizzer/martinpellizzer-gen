    "intro": "Dryopteris heleopteroides, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are shield-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of brownish or golden-colored scales. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are typically divided into narrow, linear segments."
