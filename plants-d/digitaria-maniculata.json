    "intro": "Digitaria maniculata, commonly known as the hairy fingergrass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as lawns, pastures, and disturbed areas. Digitaria maniculata is an important component of many grassland ecosystems and can be both a weed and a forage plant depending on the context."
