    "intro": "Drosera longiscapa, commonly known as the long-stemmed sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and numerous small, sticky glands that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments and is often found in the understory of humid forests. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern and are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that aid in capturing prey. Drosera longiscapa is relatively easy to cultivate in captivity, making it a popular choice among carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
