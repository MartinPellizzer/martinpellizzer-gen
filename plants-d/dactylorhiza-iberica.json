    "intro": "Dactylorhiza iberica, commonly known as the Iberian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces a single, erect stem with a few leaves and a cluster of fragrant, violet or purple flowers. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its roots are adapted to thrive in moist, acidic soils. This species is of conservation interest due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity."
