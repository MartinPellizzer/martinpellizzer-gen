    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudoreptans, commonly known as the false chain fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that allows it to spread across forest floors. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
