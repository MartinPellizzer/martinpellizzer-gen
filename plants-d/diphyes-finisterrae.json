    "intro": "Diphyes finisterrae, commonly known as the Faroese fern, is a rare and endemic plant found exclusively in the Faroe Islands. It is a small, herbaceous species with delicate, feather-like fronds that grow close to the ground. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in rocky coastal areas or among moss-covered cliffs. Its leaves are characterized by their finely divided structure, which aids in maximizing light absorption in its limited habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and fragile ecosystem, Diphyes finisterrae is considered a vulnerable species."
