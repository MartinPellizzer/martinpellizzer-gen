    "intro": "Distylodon sonkeanus, commonly known as the Sonkean mountain lily, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to the high-altitude grasslands of South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant produces two types of flowers\u2014large, showy ones and smaller, less conspicuous ones\u2014hence its scientific name, which refers to the \"two styles.\" Its habitat is often in rocky or sandy soils, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
