    "intro": "Dischidia acutifolia, commonly known as the Sharp-leaved Dischidia, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its aerial roots allow it to cling to surfaces, making it well-suited for epiphytic growth. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in hanging baskets."
