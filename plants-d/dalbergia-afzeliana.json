    "intro": "Dalbergia afzeliana, commonly known as African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and forest edge habitats. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
