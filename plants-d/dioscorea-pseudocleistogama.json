It is a perennial herbaceous vine that produces tubers as its primary storage organ. The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden within the foliage. Its tubers are characterized by their rough, irregular surface and are used in traditional medicine and as a food source. The plant's botanical features make it well adapted to moist, shaded environments in its native habitat."
