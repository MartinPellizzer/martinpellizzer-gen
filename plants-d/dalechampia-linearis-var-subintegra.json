    "intro": "Dalechampia linearis var. subintegra, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dalechampia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, a feature typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. This variant is distinguished by its slightly broader leaves compared to other forms of Dalechampia linearis."
