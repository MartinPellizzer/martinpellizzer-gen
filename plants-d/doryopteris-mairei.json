    "intro": "Doryopteris mairei, commonly known as the Maire's cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are often arched or curled, with a leathery texture. The plant typically grows on rocky or exposed coastal areas, thriving in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered along the margins of the fronds. Doryopteris mairei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
