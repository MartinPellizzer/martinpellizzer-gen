It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are arranged in dense spikes and are pollinated primarily by bees and butterflies. Delphinium penicillatum is known for its ornamental value in gardens but contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
