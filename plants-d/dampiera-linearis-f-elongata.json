    "intro": "Dampiera linearis f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated dampiera, is a variant of the native Australian plant Dampiera linearis. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or heathland environments. It is a perennial herb that thrives in full sun and is adapted to dry conditions. The elongated form of its leaves distinguishes this fasciation from the typical form of the species."
