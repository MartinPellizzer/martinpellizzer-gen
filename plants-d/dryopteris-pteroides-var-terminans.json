    "intro": "Dryopteris pteroides var. terminans, commonly known as the rock fern or shield fern, is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. It is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices, where it can retain moisture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
