    "intro": "Dischidia astephana, commonly known as the rock fig or creeping fig, is a climbing or trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, opposite leaves that often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically borne in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or trees in tropical regions. Its unique growth habit and ability to form dense mats make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
