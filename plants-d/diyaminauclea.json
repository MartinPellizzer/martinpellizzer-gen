    "intro": "Diyaminauclea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Diyaminauclea has a complex root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
