    "intro": "Dryopteris quadrifida, commonly known as the four-lobed wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into four parts, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris quadrifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture."
