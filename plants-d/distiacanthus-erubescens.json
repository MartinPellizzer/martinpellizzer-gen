    "intro": "Distiacanthus erubescens, commonly known as the red-flowered distiacanthus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking red or pink tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar production. Distiacanthus erubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and greenhouses."
