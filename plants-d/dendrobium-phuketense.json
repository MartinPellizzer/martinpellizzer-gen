It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in dense, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with red spots, blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
