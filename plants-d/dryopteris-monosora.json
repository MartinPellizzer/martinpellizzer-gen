    "intro": "Dryopteris monosora, commonly known as the single-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, single, elongated leaf that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically divided into a series of pinnae, which are usually narrowly lance-shaped. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
