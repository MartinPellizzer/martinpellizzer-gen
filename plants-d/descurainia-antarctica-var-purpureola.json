    "intro": "Descurainia antarctica var. purpureola, commonly known as Antarctic mustard, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves that help it retain heat and reduce water loss. This variant is distinguished by its purple-tinged stems and leaves, which give it a unique appearance compared to other varieties. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in alpine or coastal environments. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for insects and contributing to soil stabilization."
