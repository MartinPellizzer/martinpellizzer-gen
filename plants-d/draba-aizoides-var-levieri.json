    "intro": "Draba aizoides var. levieri, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, basal leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
