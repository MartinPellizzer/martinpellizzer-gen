It consists of several species that are native to various regions of Africa, South America, and Australia. The plants typically have basal leaves that are either linear or lance-shaped, and they produce small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head. Doxantha species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. They are sometimes used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
