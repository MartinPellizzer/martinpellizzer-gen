    "intro": "Dais passerina, commonly known as the silverleaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and showy yellow central disc surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets. The plant typically grows in shrubland and coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid regions. Dais passerina is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
