    "intro": "Discolobium pulchellum var. major, commonly known as the large-flowered discolobium, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white tomentum. The plant produces clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
