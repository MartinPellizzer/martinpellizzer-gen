    "intro": "Dianthus deserti, commonly known as the desert campion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of bright pink or red flowers, which bloom in early spring. Its flowers are typically five-petaled and have a distinctive frilled edge. Dianthus deserti is well-suited to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy plant in harsh desert environments."
