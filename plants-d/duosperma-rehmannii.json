    "intro": "Duosperma rehmannii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has succulent, bluish-gray leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in sandy soils. Duosperma rehmannii is adapted to thrive in full sun and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities."
