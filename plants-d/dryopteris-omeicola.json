    "intro": "Dryopteris omeicola, commonly known as the Chinese wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into narrow, elongated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
