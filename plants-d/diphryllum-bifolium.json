    "intro": "Diphryllum bifolium, commonly known as the two-leaved diphryllum, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Diphylleaceae. It is characterized by its striking, umbrella-like structure composed of multiple whorls of leaf-like structures called phyllodes. Native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant's botanical features include a short, unbranched stem with a cluster of modified leaves that are often green or reddish in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Diphryllum bifolium is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
