    "intro": "Diplazium turubalense, commonly known as the Turubalense water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically submerged or floating in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has a creeping rhizome that helps it spread across the substrate, forming dense mats. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are often covered in a layer of indusia. Diplazium turubalense is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Australia."
