It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinctive wavy margin. Delphinium macroseratilis is noted for its toxicity, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to both livestock and humans."
