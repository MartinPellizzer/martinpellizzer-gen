    "intro": "Dendrobium parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with short, cylindrical pseudobulbs and narrow,\u9769\u8d28 leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces racemes of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is a popular choice for both indoor cultivation and horticultural collections."
