It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed fronds that resemble the shape of a walnut leaf. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking ornamental plant."
