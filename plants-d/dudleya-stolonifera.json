    "intro": "Dudleya stolonifera, commonly known as the coastal dudleya, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Dudleya stolonifera is also known for its ability to form stolons, which allow it to spread and colonize new areas."
