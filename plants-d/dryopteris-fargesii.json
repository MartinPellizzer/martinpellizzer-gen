    "intro": "Dryopteris fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' wood fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a leathery texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris fargesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage."
