    "intro": "Daucus serratus, commonly known as the coastal carrot or sea carrot, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like parsley and dill. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Daucus serratus thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found growing along shorelines. Its seeds are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its ability to colonize coastal areas."
