    "intro": "Dryopteris argentea, commonly known as the silver female fern, is a species of polypod fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, silver-white underside on its fronds, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. The fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile fronds in the second."
