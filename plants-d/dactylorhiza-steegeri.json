    "intro": "Dactylorhiza steegeri, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of purple or pink flowers. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is relatively easy to cultivate in moist, well-drained conditions."
