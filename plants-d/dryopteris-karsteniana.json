    "intro": "Dryopteris karsteniana, commonly known as the Karsten's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a tall, slender, upright rhizome with a dense crown of lance-shaped, bright green leaves. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure that gives it a delicate appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
