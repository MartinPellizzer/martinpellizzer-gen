    "intro": "Decodon myrtifolius, commonly known as the red stem bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually green with a reddish tinge on the underside. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. Decodon myrtifolius plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic wildlife."
