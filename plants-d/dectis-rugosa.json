    "intro": "Dectis rugosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a rough or hairy texture, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to violet in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Dectis rugosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
