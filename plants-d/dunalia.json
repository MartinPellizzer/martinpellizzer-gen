These plants are characterized by their slender, grass-like stems and small, often blue or purple flowers. Dunalia species are typically found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and meadows. They have fibrous roots and produce seed heads that are often used in traditional medicine. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value."
