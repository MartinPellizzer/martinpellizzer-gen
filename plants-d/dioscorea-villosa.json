    "intro": "Dioscorea villosa, commonly known as wild yam, is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically alternate along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by cylindrical, yellowish fruits containing numerous seeds. Its tubers, which are the primary part used, have a rough, scaly surface and are often harvested for their medicinal properties. Dioscorea villosa has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential hormonal and anti-inflammatory effects."
