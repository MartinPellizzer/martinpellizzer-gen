    "intro": "Dendrobium caespitificum, commonly known as the clustered dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit, with cane-like stems that produce numerous leaves and flowers along their length. The plant typically blooms with fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often in clusters. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Dendrobium caespitificum thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
