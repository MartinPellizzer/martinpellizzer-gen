    "intro": "Duranta fletcheriana, commonly known as the golden bell plant, is a flowering shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in clusters at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and some animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. The leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly waxy texture."
