It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. Diplazium allorgei is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
