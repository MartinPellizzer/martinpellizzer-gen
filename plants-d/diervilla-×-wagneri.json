    "intro": "Diervilla \u00d7 wagneri, commonly known as the compact firethorn, is a hybrid shrub that combines traits from Diervilla roborowskii and Diervilla sinensis. It is native to China and is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its vibrant red berries and dense, upright growth habit. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly glossy texture. Its flowers are usually yellow and appear in clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer. The berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, ripen in the fall and provide food for birds."
