    "intro": "Dendrophthoe celastroides, commonly known as the Indian ghost fern, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Dilleniaceae and is characterized by its lack of true roots, relying instead on specialized structures called haustoria to extract nutrients from its host. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a dense, moss-like covering of leaves that gives it a ghostly appearance. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. Due to its parasitic nature and unique morphology, it plays a specific ecological role in its habitat."
