    "intro": "Dendrobium roseicolor, commonly known as the pink-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are striking, with a mix of pink and white petals, often with a contrasting lip. Dendrobium roseicolor thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
