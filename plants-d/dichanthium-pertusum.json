    "intro": "Dichanthium pertusum, commonly known as the rough millet, is a grass species native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both bisexual and stamen-bearing florets. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides. Dichanthium pertusum is valued for its hardiness and has been used traditionally for forage and soil stabilization."
