    "intro": "Digitaria corymbosa, commonly known as flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its flat, often prostrate growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and pastures. Due to its hardy nature, it is both a weed and a forage species in many regions."
