    "intro": "Dimerostemma asperatum, commonly known as the rough dimerostemma, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species, and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with five petals and a distinctive corolla. Its leaves are often covered in a rough, hairy texture, which gives it its common name. Dimerostemma asperatum is adapted to grow in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in scrub or shrubland environments."
