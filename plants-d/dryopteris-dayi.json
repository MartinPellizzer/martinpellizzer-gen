    "intro": "Dryopteris dayi, commonly known as the Chinese wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The fronds are often divided into segments with a distinctive, serrated edge."
