    "intro": "Dipterocarpus angustialatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dipterocarp, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and its ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, particularly in lowland rainforests. Due to its hard timber, it is also valued for commercial purposes, though it faces threats from deforestation."
