The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Draba aizoides var. laevipes is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of high-elevation ecosystems."
