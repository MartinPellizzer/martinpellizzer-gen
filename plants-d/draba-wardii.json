    "intro": "Draba wardii, commonly known as the Ward's whitlow, is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches a height of about 5 to 15 centimeters. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Native to the alpine regions of Central Asia, it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Draba wardii is considered a rare and endangered species."
