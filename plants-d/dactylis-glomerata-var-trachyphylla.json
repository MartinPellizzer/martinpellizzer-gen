    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. trachyphylla, commonly known as rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, clustered inflorescence. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and stems, which contribute to its common name. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground. Rough brome is often used in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and adaptability."
