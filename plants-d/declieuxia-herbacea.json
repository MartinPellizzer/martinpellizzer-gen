    "intro": "Declieuxia herbacea, commonly known as the soft grass or velvet grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South Africa. It features dense, tufted foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or pale yellow, arranged in loose clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal and ecological benefits."
