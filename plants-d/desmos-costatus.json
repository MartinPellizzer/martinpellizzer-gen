    "intro": "Desmos costatus, commonly known as the serrated sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive serrated leaf margins and costate (ridged) stem structure. Desmos costatus is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in arid environments."
