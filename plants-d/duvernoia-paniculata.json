    "intro": "Duvernoia paniculata, commonly known as the Chinese broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which are borne on long, slender stems. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it is often found in forested areas with suitable host vegetation. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, though it is not commonly cultivated."
