    "intro": "Diospyros longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract ebony, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, glossy bark and elliptical leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, round fruits that resemble small dates. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a member of the Ebenaceae family, which includes other notable species like the African ebony. The tree is also valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture making."
