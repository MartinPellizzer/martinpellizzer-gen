It is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom early in spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in woodland areas and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Daphne mezereum f. alba is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and early blooming habit."
