    "intro": "Dryopteris reichsteinii, commonly known as the Reichstein's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly China and Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
