    "intro": "Dendrobium papilio, commonly known as the butterfly orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which attract pollinators. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, helping it survive in its natural habitat. Dendrobium papilio is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
