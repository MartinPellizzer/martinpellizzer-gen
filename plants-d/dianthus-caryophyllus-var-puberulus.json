    "intro": "Dianthus caryophyllus var. puberulus, commonly known as the rough pinks, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and clusters of showy, double-petaled flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The leaves are typically narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant its \"puberulus\" designation. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
