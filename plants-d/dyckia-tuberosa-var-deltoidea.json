    "intro": "Dyckia tuberosa var. deltoidea, commonly known as the delta dyckia, is a compact, clump-forming bromeliad native to South America. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable ornamental plant in both tropical and subtropical climates."
