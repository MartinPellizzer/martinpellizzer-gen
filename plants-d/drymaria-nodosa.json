    "intro": "Drymaria nodosa, commonly known as the nodding sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and coastal regions of the Americas. It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, often nodding toward the ground, giving it its common name. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Drymaria nodosa is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to withstand high levels of sunlight and salt exposure."
