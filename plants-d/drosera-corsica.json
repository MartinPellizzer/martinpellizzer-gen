    "intro": "Drosera corsica, commonly known as the Corsican Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the Mediterranean island of Corsica. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sweet-smelling nectar to attract insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs or heathlands. Its leaves are rosette-shaped and covered in tiny, hair-like structures that trap and digest prey. Drosera corsica is a low-growing plant that plays a unique role in its ecosystem by supplementing its nutrient intake through insect consumption."
