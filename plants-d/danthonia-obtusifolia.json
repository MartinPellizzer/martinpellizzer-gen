    "intro": "Danthonia obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed danthonia, is a perennial grass native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
