    "intro": "Digitaria redheadii, commonly known as redhead grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are usually green or reddish in color. It is a member of the Poaceae family and is characterized by its ability to thrive in wet environments. Digitaria redheadii is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
