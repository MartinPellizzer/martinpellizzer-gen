It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or purple. The plants are perennial and often found in moist, woodland habitats across parts of Asia and North America. Dischizolaena species usually have lance-shaped leaves and produce small, capsule-like fruits.
