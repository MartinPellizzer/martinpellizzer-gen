    "intro": "Digitaria proxima, commonly known as coastal bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dune environments and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to tolerate salt spray and periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion."
