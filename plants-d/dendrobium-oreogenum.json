    "intro": "Dendrobium oreogenum, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its upright, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically blooming during the winter months. It thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
