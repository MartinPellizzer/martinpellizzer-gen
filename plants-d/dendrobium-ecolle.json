    "intro": "Dendrobium ecolle, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium ecolle is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
