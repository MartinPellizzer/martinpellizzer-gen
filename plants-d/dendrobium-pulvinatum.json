    "intro": "Dendrobium pulvinatum, commonly known as the pulvinated orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with branched, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged spirally around the stem. Dendrobium pulvinatum thrives in humid, well-lit environments and requires good air circulation for optimal growth."
