    "intro": "Didymopanax marginatus, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or Brazilian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its large, compound leaves with a distinctive margin that is often serrated or toothed. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its dense, heavy wood, which has been historically used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
