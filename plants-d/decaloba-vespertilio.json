    "intro": "Decaloba vespertilio, commonly known as the evening bell orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in the late afternoon or evening, hence its common name. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a new growth from a basal node. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, often covered in a fine layer of hair. The flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by specific insects."
