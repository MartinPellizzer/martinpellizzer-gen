    "intro": "Diadesma cardanisea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically valued for its durability and aromatic properties. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in many regions."
