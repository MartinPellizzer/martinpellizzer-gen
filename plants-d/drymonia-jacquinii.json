    "intro": "Drymonia jacquinii, commonly known as the jacquin's drymonia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, often blooming in late spring. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a glossy surface and a distinctively aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
