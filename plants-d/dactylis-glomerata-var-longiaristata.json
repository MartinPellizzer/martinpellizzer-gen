    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. longiaristata, commonly known as the long-awned cocksfoot, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, slender awns on its florets, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is often used in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and adaptability."
