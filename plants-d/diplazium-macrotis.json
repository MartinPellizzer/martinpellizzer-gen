    "intro": "Diplazium macrotis, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Diplazium macrotis thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
