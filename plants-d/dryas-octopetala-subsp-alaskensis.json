    "intro": "Dryas octopetala subsp. alaskensis, commonly known as the Alaska dryas, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of the vegetation in its native habitat."
