It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikelets, which are borne on cylindrical inflorescences. Decaisnina forsteriana is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique texture and adaptability to humid conditions."
