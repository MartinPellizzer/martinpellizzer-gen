    "intro": "Dryopteris macrotheca, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds."
