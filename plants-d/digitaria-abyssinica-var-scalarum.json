    "intro": "Digitaria abyssinica var. scalarum, commonly known as African grass or scalloped fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive scalloped or wavy edge. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are arranged in dense, compact clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, fields, and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it is considered both a weed and a forage plant in various agricultural regions."
