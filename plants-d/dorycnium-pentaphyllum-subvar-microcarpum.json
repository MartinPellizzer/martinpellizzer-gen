    "intro": "Dorycnium pentaphyllum subvar. microcarpum, commonly known as the small-seeded cow vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, rounded pods containing several seeds, which are typically less than 5 mm in diameter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and soil stabilization."
