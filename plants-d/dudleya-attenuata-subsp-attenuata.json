It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
