    "intro": "Dryopteris samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the islands of Samoa and Tonga. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
