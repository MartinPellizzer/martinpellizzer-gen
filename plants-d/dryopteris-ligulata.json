    "intro": "Dryopteris ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and have a glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
