    "intro": "Dianthus biternatus, commonly known as the three-leaved campion, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring basal leaves that are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three parts. Its flowers are borne on slender stems and are often arranged in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. Dianthus biternatus is often found in meadows and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun."
