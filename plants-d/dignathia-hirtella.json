    "intro": "Dignathia hirtella, commonly known as the hairy leaf fern, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its feathery, delicate fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Dignathia hirtella is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
