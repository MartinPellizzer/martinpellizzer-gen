    "intro": "Dammara australis var. glauca, commonly known as the blue-leaved dammara, is a variant of the dammara plant native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive bluish-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters, and the plant is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value."
