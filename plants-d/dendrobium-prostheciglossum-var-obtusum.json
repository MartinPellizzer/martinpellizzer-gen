    "intro": "Dendrobium prostheciglossum var. obtusum, commonly known as the broad-lipped dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive broad lip that adds to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
