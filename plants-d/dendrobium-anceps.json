    "intro": "Dendrobium anceps, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. The plant produces striking red or pink flowers with yellow throats, which bloom during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its tropical habitat. Dendrobium anceps is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
