    "intro": "Dryopteris filix-mas var. khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi shield fern, is a variant of the male fern native to the northeastern regions of India. It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common sight in humid, tropical climates. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance."
