    "intro": "Disporum smilacinum var. ramosum, commonly known as the clustered disporum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems rise from the base, producing small, white, star-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. The variety ramosum is distinguished by its more branched inflorescence compared to the typical form."
