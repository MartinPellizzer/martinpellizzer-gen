    "intro": "Drymoglossum carnosum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser cushion moss, is a small, evergreen moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green, firm leaves that are typically less than 1 mm in width. The leaves are often slightly curled at the tips and have a distinctive, smooth, and shiny surface. This variety is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It is a cryptogamic plant that reproduces through spores rather than seeds, contributing to its ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention."
