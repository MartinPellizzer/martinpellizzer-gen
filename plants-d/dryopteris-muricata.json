    "intro": "Dryopteris muricata, commonly known as the hairy woodfern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments with a hairy texture on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The hairy woodfern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
