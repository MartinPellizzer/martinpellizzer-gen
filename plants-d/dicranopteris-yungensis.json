    "intro": "Dicranopteris yungensis, commonly known as the Yungeng water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Dicranopteris yungensis is valued for its aesthetic appeal and its ability to improve water quality by absorbing nutrients."
