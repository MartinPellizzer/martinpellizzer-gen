    "intro": "Deschampsia flexuosa var. stricta, commonly known as stiff hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, upright stems with fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, which are arranged in a panicle-like structure. This variety is noted for its ability to thrive in wet conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
