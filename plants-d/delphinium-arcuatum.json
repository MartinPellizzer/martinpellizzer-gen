    "intro": "Delphinium arcuatum, commonly known as the bentflower larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often curve at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in spires along the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Delphinium arcuatum is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
