    "intro": "Danthonia antarctica var. laxiflora, commonly known as the Antarctic grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Australia. It features fine, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, adapted to survive in harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny white or pale blue flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and alpine regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid environments."
