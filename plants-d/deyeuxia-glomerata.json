    "intro": "Deyeuxia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, triangular stems and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Deyeuxia glomerata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
