It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often lobed or serrated. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange to red fruits, which are edible when fully ripe.

The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in local medicine and cuisine."
