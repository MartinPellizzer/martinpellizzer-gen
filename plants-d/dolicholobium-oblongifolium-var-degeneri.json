    "intro": "Dolicholobium oblongifolium var. degeneri, commonly known as the Degener's broadleaf dolicholobium, is a rare and unique variant of the dolicholobium genus. It is characterized by its elongated, broad leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant exhibits a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture, and its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in specific microhabitats, often found in shaded, moist environments with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
