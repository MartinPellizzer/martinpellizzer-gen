It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and linear leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
