    "intro": "Dendrobium capra, commonly known as the capra orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its pseudobulbs are thick and store water, helping it survive in its often-dry habitat. Dendrobium capra is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
