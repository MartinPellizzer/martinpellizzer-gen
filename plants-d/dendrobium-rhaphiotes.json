    "intro": "Dendrobium rhaphiotes, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with numerous, clustered pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in two rows along the stem. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
