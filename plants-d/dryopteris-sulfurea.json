    "intro": "Dryopteris sulfurea, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of polypody fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow to golden-green fronds, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in various habitats. The fronds are usually lance-shaped and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, making it a distinctive and ornamental plant."
