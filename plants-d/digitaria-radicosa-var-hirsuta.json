    "intro": "Digitaria radicosa var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy digitaria, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and compact, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields or along roadsides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it a common weed. The leaves are usually narrow and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
