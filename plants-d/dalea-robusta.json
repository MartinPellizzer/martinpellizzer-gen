    "intro": "Dalea robusta, commonly known as the robust milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to red. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions and fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Dalea robusta plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native environment."
