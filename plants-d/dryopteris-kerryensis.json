    "intro": "Dryopteris kerryensis, commonly known as Kerry shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of western Ireland. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, lanceolate pinnae that give the plant a lush, shield-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, humusy soil. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage."
