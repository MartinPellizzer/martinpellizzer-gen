    "intro": "Dudleya parva, commonly known as the dwarf dudleya, is a small, succulent plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring. It is well adapted to rocky soils and can survive in full sun. Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
