    "intro": "Dracaena cinnabari, commonly known as the Socotra cinnabar tree, is a unique succulent native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive red sap, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of vermilion pigment. The plant has a thick, gnarled trunk and produces small, inconspicuous white flowers. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often curl at the tips, giving it an otherworldly appearance. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is classified as critically endangered."
