    "intro": "Dryopteris wollastonii, commonly known as the Wollaston's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they emerge from a short, dark rhizome. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern on the underside of the fronds."
