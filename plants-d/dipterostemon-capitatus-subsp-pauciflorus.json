    "intro": "Dipterostemon capitatus subsp. pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered dipterostemon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and canyon walls. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces small, pale blue to violet flowers in terminal clusters. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other xerophytic species. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced flower number compared to the typical form of the species."
