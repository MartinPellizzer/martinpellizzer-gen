    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 algonquinensis, commonly known as the Algonquin shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris marginalis. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a distinctive, slightly curled margin. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin, protective layer called an indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories across eastern North America. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
