    "intro": "Daphnopsis purpusii, commonly known as the Purpus's daphnopsis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
