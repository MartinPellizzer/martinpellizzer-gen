    "intro": "Dendrobium haniffii, commonly known as the Haniff's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in humid, warm climates with high light exposure. Its unique floral structure and rarity make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
