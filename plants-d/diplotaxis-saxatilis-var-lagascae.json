    "intro": "Diplotaxis saxatilis var. lagascae, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herb native to rocky and arid regions of southern Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, oblanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single, terminal head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its thick, succulent stems and leaves allow it to store water, enabling survival in dry conditions. It is often found in coastal and mountainous habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
