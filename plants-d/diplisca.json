    "intro": "Diplisca, commonly known as the common diplisca, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley. These plants are typically herbaceous, with slender stems and finely divided leaves that resemble those of other umbelliferous species. Diplisca species produce small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, a characteristic feature of the Apiaceae family. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The genus is relatively small, with only a few recognized species distributed across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
