    "intro": "Dinemagonum gayanum var. albicaule, commonly known as the white-stemmed dinemagonum, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its slender, pale stems and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in primary rainforests. Due to habitat loss, this variant is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
