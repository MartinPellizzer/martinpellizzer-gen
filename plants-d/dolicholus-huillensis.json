    "intro": "Dolicholus huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin, rocky soil of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dolicholus huillensis is considered a vulnerable species."
