It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies. Its conservation status is critically endangered due to habitat loss and invasive species. Botanists study it to better understand its ecological role and genetic diversity in Hawaiian flora."
