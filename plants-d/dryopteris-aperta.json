    "intro": "Dryopteris aperta, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and broadly ovate fronds that are often divided into lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris aperta is a perennial plant that thrives in humid climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
