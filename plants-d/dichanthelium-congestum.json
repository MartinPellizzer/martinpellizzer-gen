    "intro": "Dichanthelium congestum, commonly known as the clustered dichanthelium, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its growth habit is often clump-forming, with dense clusters of stems arising from a central base. Dichanthelium congestum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
