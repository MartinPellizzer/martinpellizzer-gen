    "intro": "Drynaria bonii, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern on the underside of its leaves."
