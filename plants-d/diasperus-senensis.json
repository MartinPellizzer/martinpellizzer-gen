    "intro": "Diasperus senensis, commonly known as the Senegalese sand dollar, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the family Echinoidea. It is characterized by its calcareous skeleton, which forms a distinctive, flattened disc with radial spines. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters of the western Atlantic, particularly around the coast of Senegal. The skeleton of Diasperus senensis is composed of a central plate with five or more arms, each ending in a small, conical spine. Its structure is adapted for burrowing in sandy substrates, aiding in its survival within its marine habitat."
