    "intro": "Dryopteris subpennigera, commonly known as the rock fern or narrow-crested wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of spore-bearing fronds. The fronds are usually upright and have a distinctive narrow, elongated shape that distinguishes it from other fern species."
