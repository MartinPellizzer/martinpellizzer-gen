    "intro": "Daucus heterocarpus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved parsley. It is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its fruits are distinctive, with two differently shaped carpels, hence the species name \"heterocarpus.\" It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats."
