It features a sympodial growth habit with cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with contrasting color patterns. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in two rows along the stem. Dendrobium bihamulatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
