    "intro": "Danthonia involuta, commonly known as the curly hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and distinctive, spirally twisted leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
