    "intro": "Datura stramonium var. canescens, commonly known as the white angel's trumpet, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale purple, with a trumpet-like shape. The plant has thick, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is known for its potent alkaloid content, including scopolamine and atropine. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
