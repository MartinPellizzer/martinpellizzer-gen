It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers. Native to arctic and alpine regions, it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas of Europe and Asia. Its short life cycle and ability to survive in harsh environments make it a resilient species."
