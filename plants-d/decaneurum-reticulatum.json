    "intro": "Decaneurum reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its finely textured, grass-like foliage. It features narrow, linear leaves with a distinctive reticulate (net-like) venation pattern, which is a key botanical identifier. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the grass family (Poaceae). It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
