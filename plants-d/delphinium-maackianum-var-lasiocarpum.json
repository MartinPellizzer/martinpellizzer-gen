    "intro": "Delphinium maackianum var. lasiocarpum, commonly known as the Maack's delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, bearing clusters of blue to violet flowers. The leaves are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces cylindrical seed pods that are hairy, a feature that distinguishes this variety from others in the species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
