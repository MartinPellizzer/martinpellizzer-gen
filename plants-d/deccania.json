    "intro": "Deccania, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a genus of flowering plants native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in the cool, moist environments of the Andes. The plants typically have rhizomatous growth and are often found growing on rocky slopes or in forested areas. Deccania species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated for their unique floral displays. Their botanical significance also lies in their role as indicators of ecological health in high-altitude ecosystems."
