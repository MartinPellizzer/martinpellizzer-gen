    "intro": "Diplotaxis virgata subsp. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf African dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features basal rosettes of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
