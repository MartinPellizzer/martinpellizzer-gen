    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa var. maritima, commonly known as sea wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, saline soils. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is well adapted to harsh coastal environments, making it an important pioneer species in dune stabilization."
