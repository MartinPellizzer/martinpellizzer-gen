    "intro": "Dryopteris crinipes, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble pineapples, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are typically bright green with a slightly curled edge, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori. Dryopteris crinipes is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
