    "intro": "Dodecatheon dispar, commonly known as the slender glory-of-the-snow, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with lanceolate leaves that are hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it often thrives in moist, woodland environments.
