    "intro": "Dianthus caryophyllus subsp. godronianus, commonly known as the Godron's campion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink or red petals that resemble those of its more famous relative, the carnation. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the standard Dianthus caryophyllus."
