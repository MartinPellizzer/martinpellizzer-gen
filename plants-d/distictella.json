    "intro": "Distictella, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and a hollow, toothed stem. The plant produces a cluster of small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads, which are dispersed by the wind. Distictella is native to Europe but has become naturalized in many parts of the world. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine and as a food source."
