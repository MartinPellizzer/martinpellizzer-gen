    "intro": "Dicerostylis nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese dicerostylis, is a flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically borne on slender peduncles. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in horticulture."
