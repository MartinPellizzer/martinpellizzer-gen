    "intro": "Dimeria aristata, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its floral structure consists of two rows of stamens, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Dimeria aristata is well-suited to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
