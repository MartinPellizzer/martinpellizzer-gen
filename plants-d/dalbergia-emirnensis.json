    "intro": "Dalbergia emirnensis, commonly known as the Iranian rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark-colored bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, brown seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in traditional craftsmanship and musical instruments. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
