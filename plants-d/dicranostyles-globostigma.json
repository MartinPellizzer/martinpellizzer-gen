    "intro": "Dicranostyles globostigma, commonly known as the globular-stigma moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, compact growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a distinct, globular shape formed by the aggregation of its leafy shoots. Its reproductive structures, including the globular stigmas, are specialized for spore dispersal. Dicranostyles globostigma is an important component of microhabitats in temperate and tropical regions."
