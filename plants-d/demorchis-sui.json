    "intro": "Demorchis sui, commonly known as the rare mountain orchid, is a unique species native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its root system is specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions. Due to habitat loss, Demorchis sui is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
