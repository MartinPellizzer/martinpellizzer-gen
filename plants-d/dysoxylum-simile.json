    "intro": "Dysoxylum simile, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
