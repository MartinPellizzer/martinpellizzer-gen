    "intro": "Dryopteris aculeatum subsp. lobata, commonly known as the lobate wood fern, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that are often deeply divided, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
