    "intro": "Desmodium axillare var. stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping desmodium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant is characterized by its stolons, which allow it to spread horizontally and form dense mats. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
