    "intro": "Daemonorops erinacea, commonly known as the hairy cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid and covered in a fibrous sheath. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
