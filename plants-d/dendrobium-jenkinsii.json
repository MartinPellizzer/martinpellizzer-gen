    "intro": "Dendrobium jenkinsii, commonly known as the Jenkins' orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically has long, narrow leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Dendrobium jenkinsii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
