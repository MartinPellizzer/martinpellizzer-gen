It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often with a subtle fragrance. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it has a tendency to exude a milky sap when damaged.
