    "intro": "Dryopteris scalpturoides var. jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican wood fern, is a variant of the scalpturoides fern species. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its foliage is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid climates."
