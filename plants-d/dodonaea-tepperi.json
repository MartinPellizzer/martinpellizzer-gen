    "intro": "Dodonaea tepperi, commonly known as the silverleaf dodonaea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Dodonaea tepperi is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
