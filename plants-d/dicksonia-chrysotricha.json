    "intro": "Dicksonia chrysotricha, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are covered with golden-yellow hairs, which give the plant its common name and contribute to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. This species is valued for its unique appearance and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
