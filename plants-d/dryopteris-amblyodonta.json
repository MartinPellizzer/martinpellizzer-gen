    "intro": "Dryopteris amblyodonta, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, hairy layer called the indusium."
