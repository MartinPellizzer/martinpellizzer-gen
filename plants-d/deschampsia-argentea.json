    "intro": "Deschampsia argentea, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name and distinguishes it from other grasses. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils. It produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Deschampsia argentea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
