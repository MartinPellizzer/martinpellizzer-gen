    "intro": "Dianthus algetanus var. turolensis, commonly known as the Turolensis Campion, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers with five petals, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
