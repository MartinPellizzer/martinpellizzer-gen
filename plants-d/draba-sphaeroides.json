It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants known for their small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its compact growth habit and showy yellow flowers make it a distinctive feature in its habitat.
