    "intro": "Dryas viscosa, commonly known as mountain avens, is a perennial flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features waxy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, harsh environments. Its flowers are typically white or pink, with five petals, and bloom in early summer. Dryas viscosa is well adapted to rocky and barren soils, making it a hardy species found in high-altitude and polar regions."
