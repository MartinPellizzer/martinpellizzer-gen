    "intro": "Davallia forsteri, commonly known as the mouse tail fern, is a tropical fern characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that resemble mouse tails. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, including regions like India and the Philippines. The plant features rhizomes that produce small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sorangia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil to flourish. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for indoor and shaded garden settings."
