    "intro": "Dracula deltoidea, commonly known as the delta orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. Native to the cloud forests of western Ecuador, it thrives in high-altitude, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its elongated, drooping inflorescences and vivid, often bi-colored flowers. Its unique morphology includes specialized structures that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Dracula deltoidea is considered endangered and is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts."
