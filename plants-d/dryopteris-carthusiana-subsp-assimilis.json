It features dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens."
