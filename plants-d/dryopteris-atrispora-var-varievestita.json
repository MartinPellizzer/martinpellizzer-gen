    "intro": "Dryopteris atrispora var. varievestita, commonly known as the variable-stemmed wood fern, is a fern species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a dark green coloration on the upper surface and a lighter, often variegated underside. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lanceolate to ovate pinnae that are densely packed along the rachis. This variety is distinguished by its variable pigmentation patterns on the fronds, which can range from dark green to nearly black, with contrasting lighter veins. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
