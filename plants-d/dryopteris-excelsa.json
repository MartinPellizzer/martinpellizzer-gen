    "intro": "Dryopteris excelsa, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a tall, upright fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It can grow up to 3 meters in height, featuring large, triangular, and often deeply lobed fronds. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent in the dark, a unique characteristic that aids in nighttime pollination. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
