    "intro": "Doellingeria engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has narrow, floating leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its small, white flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, round fruits that float on the water's surface. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
