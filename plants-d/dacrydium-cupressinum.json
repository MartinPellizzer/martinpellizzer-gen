    "intro": "Dacrydium cupressinum, commonly known as the New Zealand rimu, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, conical crown. The tree has scale-like leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and whitish underneath, providing a distinctive appearance. It produces small, globose cones that contain seeds, and it plays a significant role in the ecological systems of New Zealand. The wood of the rimu is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it an important resource in the region's history and culture."
