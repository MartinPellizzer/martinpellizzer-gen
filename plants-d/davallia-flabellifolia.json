    "intro": "Davallia flabellifolia, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a bird's nest, with overlapping, fan-like leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stolons that allow it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening."
