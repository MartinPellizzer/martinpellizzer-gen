    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 deweveri, commonly known as the Dewever's shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octopleura. It is a medium-sized evergreen fern characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments. The plant produces spore-bearing fiddleheads in early spring, which develop into fertile fronds by summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe, it thrives in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
