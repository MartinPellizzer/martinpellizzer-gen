    "intro": "Dombeya cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaf dombeya, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green and glossy, and its showy clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Dombeya cordifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
