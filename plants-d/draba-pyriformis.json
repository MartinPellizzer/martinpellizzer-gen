It is native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention.
