    "intro": "Deschampsia gulariantzii, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that turns reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a soft, ethereal appearance to its habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystems."
