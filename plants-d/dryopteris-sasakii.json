    "intro": "Dryopteris sasakii, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan and parts of Southeast Asia. It features a compact, upright growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that have a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant produces spore-bearing sori on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts are underway to protect its natural habitats."
