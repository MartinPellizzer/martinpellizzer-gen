    "intro": "Dryopteris nephrodioides f. guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupensis Shield Fern, is a fern species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that produce both roots and new fronds. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, rounded pinnae that give it a compact appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or limestone soils."
