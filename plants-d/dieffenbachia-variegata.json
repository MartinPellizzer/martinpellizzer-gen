    "intro": "Dieffenbachia variegata, commonly known as the Variegated Dieffenbachia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with white and green patterns on broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, which includes other ornamental plants like peace lilies. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care and kept away from pets and children."
