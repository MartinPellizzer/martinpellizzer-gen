It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
