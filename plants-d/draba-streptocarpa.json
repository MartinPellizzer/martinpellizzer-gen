    "intro": "Draba streptocarpa, commonly known as the clustered rockcress, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Draba streptocarpa is noted for its compact growth habit and is often found in high-altitude ecosystems where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to the otherwise stark mountain landscapes."
