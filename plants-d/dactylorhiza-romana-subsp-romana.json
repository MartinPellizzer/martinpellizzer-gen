It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, greenish-yellow to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. It has a complex life cycle involving a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. The species is considered rare and is protected in several countries due to habitat loss and over-collection."
