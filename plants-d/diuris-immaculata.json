The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained soils, often in rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its delicate appearance. The species is known for its ability to form dense colonies and is a popular subject in botanical studies due to its unique floral structure and ecological significance."
