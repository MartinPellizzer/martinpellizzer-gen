    "intro": "Daucus gingidium var. hispidus, commonly known as hairy cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Due to its hairy stems and leaves, it is easily distinguishable from other members of its genus."
