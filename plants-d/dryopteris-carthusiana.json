    "intro": "Dryopteris carthusiana, commonly known as the Carthusian water fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens."
