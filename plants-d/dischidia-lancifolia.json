    "intro": "Dischidia lancifolia, commonly known as the lance-leaf dischidia, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, lanceolate leaves that are usually dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor ornamental purposes."
