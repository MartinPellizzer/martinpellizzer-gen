    "intro": "Dryopteris angustipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
