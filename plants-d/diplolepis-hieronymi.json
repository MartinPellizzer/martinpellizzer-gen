It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural interest."
