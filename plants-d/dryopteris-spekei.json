    "intro": "Dryopteris spekei, commonly known as Speke's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often forming dense colonies on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
