    "intro": "Dalbergia retusa var. pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and acoustic properties. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical climates and has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
