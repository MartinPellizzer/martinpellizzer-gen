    "intro": "Dioscorea leiboldiana, commonly known as the leibold's yam, is a member of the Dioscoreaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a climbing herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary vegetative structures. The plant produces tendrils for support and has alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it relies on insect pollination. The tubers of D. leiboldiana are sometimes used in traditional medicine and are valued for their nutritional content."
