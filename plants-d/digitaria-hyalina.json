    "intro": "Digitaria hyalina, commonly known as the glassy grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, translucent blades that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Digitaria hyalina is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
