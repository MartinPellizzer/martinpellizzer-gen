    "intro": "Discocactus linkii, commonly known as the Mexican star cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a cylindrical stem with ribbed structure, which helps it store water in arid environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores. Discocactus linkii thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens."
