    "intro": "Donnellyanthus deamii, commonly known as the Deam's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and white, sticky berries that contain the seeds. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its specialized haustoria that attach to the host. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and other animals that consume its berries."
