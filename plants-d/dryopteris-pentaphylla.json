    "intro": "Dryopteris pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-finger fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that resemble the fingers of a hand, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are extensively branched, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are dark green and remain viable for several years, contributing to the plant's ornamental value in gardens."
