    "intro": "Desmotrichum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a small, herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture. Its flowers are small, yellow, and similar in appearance to those of the common dandelion. It is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
