    "intro": "Daphniphyllum himalense, commonly known as the Himalayan holly, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically glossy and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red or orange berries in autumn. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
