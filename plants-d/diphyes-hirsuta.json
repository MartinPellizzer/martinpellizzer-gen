    "intro": "Diphyes hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy diphyes, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences during the warmer months. Its leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, making it drought-tolerant. The species is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
