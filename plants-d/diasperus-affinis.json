    "intro": "Diasperus affinis, commonly known as the African grassvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as savannas and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, pale flowers that are clustered in dense spikes. Diasperus affinis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
