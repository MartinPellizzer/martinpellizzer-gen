    "intro": "Dichanthium radicans, commonly known as the creeping fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively across the ground. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its seeds are typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Dichanthium radicans is often found in open habitats such as lawns, roadsides, and disturbed agricultural areas."
