    "intro": "Dicliptera pectinata, commonly known as the hairy lemongrass, is a tropical perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, giving it a citrusy scent and making it useful in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb. Dicliptera pectinata is often grown for its ornamental value and for its potential medicinal properties."
