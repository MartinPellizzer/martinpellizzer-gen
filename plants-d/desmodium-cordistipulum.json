It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it is often found in open woodland and grassland habitats. Desmodium cordistipulum has a climbing habit and can be found in various soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. It is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
