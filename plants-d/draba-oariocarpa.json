    "intro": "Draba oariocarpa, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada whitlowgrass, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its alpine habitat. It has a low, mat-like growth form with narrow leaves and produces seeds in small, pod-like structures. Draba oariocarpa is an important component of the alpine flora and is often found in meadows and slopes above the tree line."
