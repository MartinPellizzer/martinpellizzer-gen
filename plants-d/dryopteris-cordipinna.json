    "intro": "Dryopteris cordipinna, commonly known as the heart-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
