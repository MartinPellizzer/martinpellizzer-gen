It features a sympodial growth habit with a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip, which attracts pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
