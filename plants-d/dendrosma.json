It consists of several species, primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their rough, often hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. They produce showy, five-petaled flowers that are usually pink, red, or purple in color. Dendrosma species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
