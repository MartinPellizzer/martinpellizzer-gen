    "intro": "Danthonia filiformis, commonly known as slender danthonia, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width, with a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to prevent erosion."
