    "intro": "Dryopteris melanosticta, commonly known as the black-stained wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that often have a distinctive blackish or brownish tint along the veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
