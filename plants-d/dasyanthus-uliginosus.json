    "intro": "Dasyanthus uliginosus, commonly known as the swamp daisy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is often found in wetlands alongside other moisture-loving plants like sedges and rushes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
