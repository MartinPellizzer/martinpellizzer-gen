    "intro": "Diplazium khullarii, commonly known as the Khullar's water fern, is a species of fern native to the wetlands of northeastern India. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Diplazium khullarii plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
