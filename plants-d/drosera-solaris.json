    "intro": "Drosera solaris, commonly known as the sun dew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically bright red or orange, which helps attract prey. It thrives in wet, acidic environments and requires consistent moisture. Drosera solaris is a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and unique feeding mechanism."
