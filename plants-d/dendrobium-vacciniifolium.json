    "intro": "Dendrobium vacciniifolium, commonly known as the Vaccinium-leaf orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features elongated, leathery pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its leaves are dark green and resemble those of the Vaccinium plant, giving it its common name. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or red streaks."
