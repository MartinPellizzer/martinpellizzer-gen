    "intro": "Diarthron ramosissimum, commonly known as the hairy stick orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Diarthron ramosissimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
