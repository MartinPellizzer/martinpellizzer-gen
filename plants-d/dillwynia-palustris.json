    "intro": "Dillwynia palustris, commonly known as the swamp dillwynia, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swampy areas and creeklines, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its small, white or pale blue flowers appear in clusters and are often visited by native bees and other pollinators. Dillwynia palustris is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
