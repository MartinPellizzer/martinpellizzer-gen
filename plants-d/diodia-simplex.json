    "intro": "Diodia simplex, commonly known as white snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its roots contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested. Despite its toxicity, it plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its chemical properties."
