    "intro": "Dentaria tenella var. palmata, commonly known as the palmate toothwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which resemble the shape of a hand, and its small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is known for its unique underground tubers that store nutrients. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern."
