    "intro": "Diemisa concolor, commonly known as the smoothleaf diemisa, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and glabrous on both sides. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
