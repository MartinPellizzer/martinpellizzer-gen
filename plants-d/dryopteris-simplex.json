    "intro": "Dryopteris simplex, commonly known as the lady fern, is a deciduous fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds."
