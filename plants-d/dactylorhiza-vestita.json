    "intro": "Dactylorhiza vestita, commonly known as the slender bog orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a terrestrial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, acidic habitats such as bogs and heathlands. The plant features a slender stem with few leaves and produces a single spike of small, pale pink to white flowers. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil in which it thrives. Dactylorhiza vestita is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate appearance and ecological significance in wetland ecosystems."
