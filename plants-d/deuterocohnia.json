    "intro": "Deuterocohnia, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae. These plants are native to the Andes Mountains in South America, where they thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Deuterocohnia species are characterized by their rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly coating. They produce striking, showy inflorescences with colorful bracts that can range from red to yellow. Due to their unique appearance and adaptability, they are popular among succulent and bromeliad enthusiasts."
