It is characterized by its fragrant, vanilla-scented flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are elongated and glossy, with a dark green color. The orchid's unique aroma has made it a subject of interest for both horticultural and aromatic research."
