    "intro": "Dryopteris intermedia f. fructuosa, commonly known as the fruiting intermediate wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its unique fructification features. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to parts of Asia, particularly China. The plant exhibits a compact, shrub-like growth habit with fronds that are typically shorter and more robust compared to the species. Its spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are notably clustered and often surrounded by a distinctive indusium, contributing to its ornamental value. This fern is prized in horticulture for its unusual appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
