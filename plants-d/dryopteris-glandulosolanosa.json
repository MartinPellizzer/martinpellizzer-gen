    "intro": "Dryopteris glandulosolanosa, commonly known as the glandular-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the soil. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive veining pattern that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
