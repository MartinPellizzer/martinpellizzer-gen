    "intro": "Decamerium ursinum, commonly known as the bear's garlic, is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, often used in traditional cuisine. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
