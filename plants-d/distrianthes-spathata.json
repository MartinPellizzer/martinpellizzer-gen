    "intro": "Distrianthes spathata, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking aquatic plant native to the high-altitude lakes of South America. It features large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom during the summer months, often floating on the surface of still water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-rich sediments at the lake bottom. Distrianthes spathata is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its cultural significance among indigenous communities."
