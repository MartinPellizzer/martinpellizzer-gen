    "intro": "Drosera cistiflora var. minutiflora, commonly known as the minute-flowered sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, glandular-tipped hairs that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its compact growth habit and unique trapping mechanism make it a fascinating subject for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
