    "intro": "Dubautia plantaginea subsp. magnifolia, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a striking endemic plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with numerous yellow flowers, typically blooming once every few years. It thrives in high-altitude, rocky areas and is adapted to the unique climate of the Haleakal\u0101 volcano. Due to its ecological significance and conservation status, it is a symbol of Hawaii's natural heritage."
