    "intro": "Dendrocnide sessiliflora, commonly known as the stinging tree, is a flowering plant native to northern Australia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, woody stems and dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its highly toxic sap, which contains potent urticating hairs that can cause severe skin irritation. Its leaves are usually alternate, with a rough, serrated texture, and it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The stinging tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
