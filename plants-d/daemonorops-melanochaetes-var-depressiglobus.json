    "intro": "Daemonorops melanochaetes var. depressiglobus, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like arrangement of dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
