    "intro": "Dryopteris palatangana, commonly known as the Palatangana wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of southern China and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically divided into pinnae with a serrated or lobed margin, and the spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories where it forms dense colonies. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded garden settings."
