    "intro": "Delphinium apachense, commonly known as the Apache bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open woodland or mountainous areas. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces tall, slender stems that support its clusters of spurred flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
