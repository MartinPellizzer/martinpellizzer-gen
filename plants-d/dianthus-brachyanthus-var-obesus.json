    "intro": "Dianthus brachyanthus var. obesus, commonly known as the fat-leaf campion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and dense clusters of pink to purple flowers. The leaves are thick, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
