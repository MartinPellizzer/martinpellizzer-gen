    "intro": "Decaloba jorullensis, commonly known as the Jorull\u00e9n silverleaf, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray leaves covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. Decaloba jorullensis is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and requires a humid, cool climate to thrive. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
