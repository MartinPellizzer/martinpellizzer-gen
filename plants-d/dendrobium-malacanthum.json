    "intro": "Dendrobium malacanthum, commonly known as the Malacanathum orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often arranged in racemes. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
