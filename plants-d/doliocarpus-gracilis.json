    "intro": "Doliocarpus gracilis, commonly known as the slender-sheathed sycamore, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often peeling in thin layers. Doliocarpus gracilis is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture making."
