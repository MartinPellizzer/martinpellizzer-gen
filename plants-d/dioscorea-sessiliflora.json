It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a smooth margin and can grow up to 20 cm in length. The tubers of Dioscorea sessiliflora are edible when properly prepared and are also valued for their medicinal properties."
