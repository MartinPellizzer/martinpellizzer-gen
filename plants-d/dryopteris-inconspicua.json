    "intro": "Dryopteris inconspicua, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, arching growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris inconspicua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its graceful appearance."
