    "intro": "Dryopteris shiakeana, commonly known as the Shikoku shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
