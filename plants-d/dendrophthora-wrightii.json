    "intro": "Dendrophthora wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white, fleshy berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health and growth of its host trees."
