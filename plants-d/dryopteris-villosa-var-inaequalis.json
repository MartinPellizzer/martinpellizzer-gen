    "intro": "Dryopteris villosa var. inaequalis, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf wood fern native to North America. It is characterized by its fronds that are densely covered with soft, brownish hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like structure that contributes to its ornamental value. This fern is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
