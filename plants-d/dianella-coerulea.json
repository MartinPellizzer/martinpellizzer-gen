    "intro": "Dianella coerulea, commonly known as the blue-flowered flax lily, is a striking evergreen perennial native to New Zealand. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, low-growing rosette. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Dianella coerulea is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
