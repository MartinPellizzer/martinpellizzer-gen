It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. The plant features fronds that are bipinnate, with a distinctive, narrow and elongated shape. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This variety is noted for its adaptability to various soil types and its role in ecological succession in temperate regions."
