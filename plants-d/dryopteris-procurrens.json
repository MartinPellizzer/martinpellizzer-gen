    "intro": "Dryopteris procurrens, commonly known as the Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with dark, leathery fronds that are typically divided into two distinct sections. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The Shield Fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions."
