    "intro": "Delphinium siamense, commonly known as the Siam larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its foliage consists of palmate leaves with a serrated edge, and it produces showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful handling due to its toxic alkaloids."
