    "intro": "Diplostephium glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems that store water, a typical adaptation for arid environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the stems are covered in small, glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance. This plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall."
