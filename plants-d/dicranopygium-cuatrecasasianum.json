    "intro": "Dicranopygium cuatrecasasianum, commonly known as the Cuatrecasasian fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact rosette. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Dicranopygium cuatrecasasianum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
