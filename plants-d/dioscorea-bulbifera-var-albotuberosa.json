    "intro": "Dioscorea bulbifera var. albotuberosa, commonly known as the white tuber yam, is a variant of the air potato plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the production of aerial tubers, which are swollen stems that develop above the ground. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often followed by yellow or orange fruits. Its tubers are edible when properly prepared but contain toxic compounds that require careful processing. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential culinary use in certain cultures."
