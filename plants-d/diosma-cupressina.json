    "intro": "Diosma cupressina, commonly known as the creeping cypress, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, compact form and scale-like leaves that give it a resemblance to cypress trees. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Diosma cupressina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
