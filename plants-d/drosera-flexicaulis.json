    "intro": "Drosera flexicaulis, commonly known as the curled sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and swamps. Its small, pinkish-white flowers are borne on a slender stem and bloom during the warmer months. Drosera flexicaulis is a perennial species that thrives in nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
