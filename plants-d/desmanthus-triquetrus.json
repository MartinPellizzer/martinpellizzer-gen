    "intro": "Desmanthus triquetrus, commonly known as the three-angled desmanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Desmanthus triquetrus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
