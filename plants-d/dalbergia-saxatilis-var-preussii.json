It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability and intricate grain patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are bipinnate, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
