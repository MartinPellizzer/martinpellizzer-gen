    "intro": "Dillwynia glaberrima var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy dillwynia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and distinctive pod fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish in color, and it produces hairy, elongated pods that contain seeds. This variety is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) foliage, which sets it apart from other varieties of Dillwynia."
