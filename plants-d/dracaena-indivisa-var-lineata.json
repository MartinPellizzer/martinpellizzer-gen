    "intro": "Dracaena indivisa var. lineata, commonly known as the Variegated Dracaena, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It features long, strap-like leaves that are typically green with distinctive white or yellow stripes along the midrib. The plant is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its leaves are also used in traditional medicine in some cultures. The variegation in its foliage is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production."
