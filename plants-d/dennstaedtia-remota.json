    "intro": "Dennstaedtia remota, commonly known as the remote sword fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, narrow, and elongated shape. It prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique, linear pattern on the underside of the fronds."
