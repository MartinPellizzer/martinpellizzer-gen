    "intro": "Dioscorea septemnervis, commonly known as the seven-veined yam, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used as a food source. The plant has compound leaves with seven main veins, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forest understories. Its tubers are similar in appearance to other yam species but are less commonly cultivated for commercial use."
