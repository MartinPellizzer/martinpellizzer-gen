    "intro": "Drynaria rigidula var. vidgenii, commonly known as the rigid shield fern, is a fern species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, leathery fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. The plant's hardy nature makes it adaptable to various climatic conditions."
