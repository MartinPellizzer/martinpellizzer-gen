    "intro": "Digitaria natalensis, commonly known as Natal grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish-green color, often with a waxy coating. Natal grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in erosion control due to its vigorous growth habit."
