It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in swampy areas. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a unique arrangement of pinnae that gives it its common name. This fern is notable for its adaptability and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
