    "intro": "Dryopteris dimidiata, commonly known as the intermediate wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fronds that are divided into two distinct sections, with the upper part being more delicate and the lower portion more robust. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris dimidiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
