    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa subsp. obensis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and forms dense, compact tufts or clumps. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
