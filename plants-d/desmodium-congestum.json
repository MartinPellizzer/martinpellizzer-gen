It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and purple or pink flowers. The plant is often found in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. It has a shallow root system and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which benefits soil fertility. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds that are dispersed by wind or animals."
