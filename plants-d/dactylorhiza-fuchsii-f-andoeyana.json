It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive sympodial growth habit, characterized by a pseudobulb and a single, upright stem. The plant produces a single, showy spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with dark green markings. It thrives in damp, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity, it is protected under the UK's Wildlife and Countryside Act."
