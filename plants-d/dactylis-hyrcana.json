    "intro": "Dactylis hyrcana, commonly known as Persian vetch, is a perennial grass native to Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, pale green to blue flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils. Dactylis hyrcana is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
