    "intro": "Diplazium hammelianum, commonly known as the yellow holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact fronds that are typically bright green. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form thick mats in its natural habitat. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which is a common feature in many ferns. Diplazium hammelianum thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories."
