    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata nothosubsp. intercedens, commonly known as the intermediate or hybrid meadow grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist meadows and grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in early summer. It is valued for its use in forage and soil stabilization due to its robust growth and adaptability. This nothosubspecies is a hybrid between Dactylis glomerata and Dactylis glomerata var. intercedens, exhibiting intermediate characteristics in morphology and genetics."
