    "intro": "Drosera finlaysoniana, commonly known as the Finlayson's sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of northern Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, acidic environments and requires consistent humidity to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a popular subject in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
