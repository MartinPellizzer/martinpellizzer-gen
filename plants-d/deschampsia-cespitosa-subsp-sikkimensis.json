    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa subsp. sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
