    "intro": "Desmodium neurocarpum, commonly known as smallleaf burrlegume, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces burr-like seed pods that encase its small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Desmodium neurocarpum plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
