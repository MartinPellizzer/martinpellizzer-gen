It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, pentamerous flowers with five petals and stamens. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
