    "intro": "Didymocarpus neurophyllus, commonly known as the large-leafed bael tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that are often clustered at the base of the petioles. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain a single, large, edible seed. Its botanical features include a robust root system and a tendency to form buttress roots in older trees. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is also used in traditional practices across its native range."
