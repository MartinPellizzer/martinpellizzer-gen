    "intro": "Dryopteris crenulaea, commonly known as the crested maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, dark green fronds that often have a wavy or zigzag appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread through the forest floor. The fronds are deciduous, dying back in the fall and regrowing in the spring."
