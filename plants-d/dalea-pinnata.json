    "intro": "Dalea pinnata, commonly known as the scarlet penta, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant is distinguished by its bright red, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central axis. Dalea pinnata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
