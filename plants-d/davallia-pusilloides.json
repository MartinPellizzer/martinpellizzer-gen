    "intro": "Davallia pusilloides, commonly known as the dwarf chain fern, is a small, delicate fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, chain-like structures. It prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique appearance and compact size make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
