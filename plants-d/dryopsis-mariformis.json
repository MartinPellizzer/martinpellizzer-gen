    "intro": "Dryopsis mariformis, commonly known as the marimo moss ball, is a type of aquatic plant belonging to the order Chlorophyta. It is characterized by its dense, spherical growth form, which is formed by the entanglement of filamentous green algae. This plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in shallow lakes and ponds with low nutrient levels. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in aquariums and water gardens. Dryopsis mariformis plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
