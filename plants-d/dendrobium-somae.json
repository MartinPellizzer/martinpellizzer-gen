    "intro": "Dendrobium somae, commonly known as the Somalian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the highlands of Somalia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a short, thick rhizome and a profusion of linear, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces racemes of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with white and purple markings. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range."
