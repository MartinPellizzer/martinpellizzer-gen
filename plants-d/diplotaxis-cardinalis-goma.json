It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Diplotaxis cardinalis-goma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
