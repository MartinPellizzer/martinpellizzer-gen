    "intro": "Drosera tokaiensis subsp. tokaiensis, commonly known as the Tokai Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of glandular-hair-covered leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are small and usually pink or red, arranged in a dense inflorescence. The subspecies is notable for its adaptability and is often cultivated by enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and unique feeding mechanism."
