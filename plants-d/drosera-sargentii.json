    "intro": "Drosera sargentii, commonly known as Sargent's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap small insects, which the plant then digests to supplement its nutrient intake. The plant typically grows in boggy or marshy habitats where soil nutrients are scarce. Its leaves are rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of dew-like secretions. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding to its ornamental appeal."
