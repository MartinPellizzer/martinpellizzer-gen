    "intro": "Dolichandra fenzliana, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Dolichandra fenzliana is adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
