    "intro": "Draba barbata, commonly known as the barbed whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Draba barbata is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. Its compact growth habit and early blooming make it a notable species in high-altitude ecosystems."
