    "intro": "Dalea parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are pinnately divided into small, linear lobes, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain the seeds. Dalea parvifolia is adapted to arid environments and is often found in regions with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure."
