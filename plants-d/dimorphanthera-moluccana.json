    "intro": "Dimorphanthera moluccana, commonly known as the Moluccan star orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Moluccas in Indonesia. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a short, erect stem with few leaves and produces a single, showy inflorescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
