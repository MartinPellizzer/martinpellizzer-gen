    "intro": "Dunbaria glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular dunbaria, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in small, glandular dots. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid climates."
