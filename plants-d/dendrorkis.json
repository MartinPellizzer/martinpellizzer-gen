    "intro": "Dendrorkis, commonly known as the tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the world, particularly in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plant has a unique structure with a central stem that grows from a rhizome, and it produces spores instead of seeds for reproduction. Dendrorkis species typically thrive in moist, shaded environments and require high humidity to flourish. Its distinctive appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
