    "intro": "Dactylorchis maculata var. terschellingensis, commonly known as the Terschelling spotted orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Netherlands. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive purple spots. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
