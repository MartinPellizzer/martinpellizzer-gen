    "intro": "Dryopteris biformis, commonly known as the two-lobed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fronds that are divided into two distinct lobes, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are usually dark green and remain throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
