    "intro": "Duttonia sessiliceps, commonly known as the narrow-leaved duttonia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the grasslands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, sessile leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in well-drained soils. Duttonia sessiliceps is typically found in open habitats and is relatively uncommon in the wild."
