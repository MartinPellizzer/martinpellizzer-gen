    "intro": "Dendrobium kandarianum, commonly known as the Kandarian orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. Dendrobium kandarianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
