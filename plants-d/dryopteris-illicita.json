    "intro": "Dryopteris illicita, commonly known as the illicit fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Dryopteris illicita is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
