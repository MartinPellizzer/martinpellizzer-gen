    "intro": "Dorstenia caulescens, commonly known as the creeping false arum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped inflorescence that resembles a spiral of leaves, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling vine with heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a mild, sweet scent that attracts pollinators. Dorstenia caulescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
