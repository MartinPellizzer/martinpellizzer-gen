    "intro": "Dodecatheon meadia var. stanfieldii, commonly known as the Stanfield's globemallow, is a rare and striking member of the Malvaceae family. It is native to the central United States, particularly found in Oklahoma and Texas, where it thrives in open prairies and rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the top of its slender stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variant is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
