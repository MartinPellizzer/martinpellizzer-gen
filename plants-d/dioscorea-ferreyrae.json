    "intro": "Dioscorea ferreyrae, commonly known as the Ferreyra yam, is a member of the Dioscoreaceae family, native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a climbing vine characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by tuberous roots that are its primary economic and medicinal value. Its tubers are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
