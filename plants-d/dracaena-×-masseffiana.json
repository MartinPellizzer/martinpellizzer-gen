    "intro": "Dracaena \u00d7 masseffiana, commonly known as the Jade Plant or ZZ Plant, is a hybrid species within the Dracaena genus. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though it is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its blooms. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is well adapted to low-light conditions. Dracaena \u00d7 masseffiana is a popular indoor plant due to its hardiness and ability to thrive with minimal care."
