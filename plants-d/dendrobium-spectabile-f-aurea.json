    "intro": "Dendrobium spectabile f. aurea, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters along its stems. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
