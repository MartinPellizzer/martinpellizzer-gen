    "intro": "Dryopteris globulifera, commonly known as the globe fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, compact fronds that form a dense, rounded crown, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its fronds are leathery and dark green, with a velvety texture, and they remain upright throughout the year. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
