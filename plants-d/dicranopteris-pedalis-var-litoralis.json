    "intro": "Dicranopteris pedalis var. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Dicranopteris. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green to bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies such as streams and marshes. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to substrates in its wetland habitat. The plant plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing microhabitats for aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
