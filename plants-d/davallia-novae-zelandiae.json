It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that resemble a sword. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that produces both roots and new shoots. Its leaves are bi-lobed, with a glossy, dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
