It is characterized by its dark purple fronds that darken with age, giving it a striking appearance. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces fertile fronds with sporangia on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
