    "intro": "Dracaena cochinchinensis, commonly known as the dragon blood tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, rosette-like arrangement of dark green, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by orange-red berries. Its sap, known as dragon's blood, is a thick, red resin used in traditional medicine and as a dye. Dracaena cochinchinensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking appearance and air-purifying properties."
