    "intro": "Drymaria hypericifolia, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it an attractive addition to rock gardens and xeriscapes."
