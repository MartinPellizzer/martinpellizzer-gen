    "intro": "Daturicarpa lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate nightshade, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. It produces small, toxic berries that contain alkaloids, making it potentially hazardous to humans and animals. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is advised."
