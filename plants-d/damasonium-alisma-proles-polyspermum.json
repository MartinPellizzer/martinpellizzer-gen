    "intro": "Damasonium alisma proles polyspermum, commonly known as the water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant belonging to the Alismataceae family. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features long, narrow leaves that float on the water surface or emerge from the water, with a dense network of roots that help anchor it in the substrate. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spadices, which are leaf-like bracts. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
