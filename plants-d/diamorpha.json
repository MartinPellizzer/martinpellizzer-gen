    "intro": "Diamorpha, commonly known as the false mallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their palmate leaves, which are divided into five to seven lobes, and their showy, often pink or purple flowers. Diamorpha species typically have a woody stem and produce capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. They are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their attractive foliage and flowers."
