It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. The plant features distinctive quadrangular (four-sided) stems and lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its small yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.
