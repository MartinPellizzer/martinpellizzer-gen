    "intro": "Dichaea anguina, commonly known as the snake orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, vine-like growth habit and its striking, snake-like appearance due to its elongated, twisted flower spikes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dichaea anguina is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation."
