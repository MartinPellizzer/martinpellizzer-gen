    "intro": "Draba novolympica, commonly known as the Novolympic whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and low-growing habit. The plant typically has basal leaves that are linear and covered in fine hairs, and it produces white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Draba novolympica is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
