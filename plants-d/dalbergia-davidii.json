    "intro": "Dalbergia davidii, commonly known as David's rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by legumes containing flat, bean-like seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and wood quality, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural and commercial purposes."
