    "intro": "Dracaena terminalis, commonly known as the flamingo plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bright red flowers that appear at the tips, giving it its striking appearance. The plant has long, narrow, dark green leaves that are glossy and often have a slight waxy coating. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena terminalis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
