    "intro": "Dryopteris filix-mas subsp. filix-mas, commonly known as the male fern, is a robust fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length, with a distinctive upright growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
