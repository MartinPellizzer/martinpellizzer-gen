    "intro": "Deguelia densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered deguelia, is a climbing shrub native to the rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the warmer months. The plant has a woody stem with thorn-like projections, which help it to climb and support itself among the forest canopy. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy surface. Deguelia densiflora is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
