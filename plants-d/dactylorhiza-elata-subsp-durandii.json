    "intro": "Dactylorhiza elata subsp. durandii, commonly known as the Durand's marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and damp meadows. The plant features a slender, erect stem with several leaves and produces pendulous, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions and is often protected in conservation areas."
