    "intro": "Doliocarpus coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved mallow, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain several seeds. Doliocarpus coriacea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
