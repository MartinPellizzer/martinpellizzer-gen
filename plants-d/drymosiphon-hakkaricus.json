    "intro": "Drymosiphon hakkaricus, commonly known as the Karakorum mist fern, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Karakoram Mountains. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that grow in a dense, clustered formation. The plant thrives in cool, moist microclimates and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in shaded crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental stability in alpine ecosystems."
