    "intro": "Devauxia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf devauxia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it adapts well to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native habitat."
