    "intro": "Dorycnium hirsutum var. ciliatum, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are hairy and have a distinctive ciliate edge. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers followed by long, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. This variety is often used in ecological restoration and as a cover crop due to its hardy nature and adaptability."
