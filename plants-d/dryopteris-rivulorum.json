    "intro": "Dryopteris rivulorum, commonly known as the stream fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
