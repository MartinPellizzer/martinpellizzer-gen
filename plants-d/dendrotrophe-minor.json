    "intro": "Dendrotrophe minor, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests coniferous trees. It produces small, fleshy, berry-like fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots that penetrate the host tree's vascular system. It spreads via seeds that are dispersed by birds feeding on its berries. Dendrotrophe minor plays a significant role in forest ecosystems, influencing tree growth and biodiversity."
