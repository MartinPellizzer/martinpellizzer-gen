    "intro": "Draba caswellii, commonly known as Caswell's whitlow grass, is a small, flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as cabbages and mustards. This species is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Draba caswellii typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its short life cycle and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
