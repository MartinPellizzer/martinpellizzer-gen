    "intro": "Desmodium portoricense, commonly known as the Puerto Rican burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers. The plant's seeds are encased in a hairy, spiny pod, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing."
