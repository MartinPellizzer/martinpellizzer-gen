    "intro": "Dendrobium bensoniae, commonly known as the Bensonia orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant features fleshy, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Dendrobium bensoniae is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
