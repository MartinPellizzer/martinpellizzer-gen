    "intro": "Dryopteris desvauxii, commonly known as the Desvaux's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lanceolate segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Dryopteris desvauxii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
