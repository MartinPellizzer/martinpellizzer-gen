    "intro": "Datura gardneri, commonly known as angel's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or purple in color. The plant produces a spiny capsule that contains numerous seeds, and it thrives in warm, sunny environments. Datura gardneri is known for its potent alkaloids, which make it both toxic and psychoactive. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value but requires careful handling due to its harmful properties."
