    "intro": "Drosera gibsonii, commonly known as Gibson's sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
