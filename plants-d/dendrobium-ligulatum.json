    "intro": "Dendrobium ligulatum, commonly known as the narrow-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with a narrow lip that distinguishes it from other dendrobium species. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
