    "intro": "Drypetes laciniata var. acuta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed drypetes, is a shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy leaves that are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
