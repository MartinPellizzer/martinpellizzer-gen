    "intro": "Dianthus maritimus, commonly known as sea pink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. It is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species found in maritime environments. Dianthus maritimus plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
