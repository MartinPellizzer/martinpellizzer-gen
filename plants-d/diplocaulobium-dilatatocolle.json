It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized structures for trapping prey, such as bladder-like organs. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including ponds, ditches, and marshes, where it can anchor itself to submerged or floating surfaces. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with distinctive bilateral symmetry. The species is known for its unique adaptations to aquatic environments, including reduced leaves and specialized root systems."
