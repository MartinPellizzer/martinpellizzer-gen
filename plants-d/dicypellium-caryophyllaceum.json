    "intro": "Dicypellium caryophyllaceum, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many species with showy, often pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its small, clustered flowers bloom in summer, and the plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
