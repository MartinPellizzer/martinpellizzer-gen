It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, yellow-orange flowers that have a distinctive golden stripe. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often covered in a fine, white pubescence. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid environments."
