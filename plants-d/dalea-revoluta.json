    "intro": "Dalea revoluta, commonly known as the curledleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Dalea revoluta thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with Rhizobium bacteria, contributing to soil fertility."
