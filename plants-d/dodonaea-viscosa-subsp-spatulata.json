    "intro": "Dodonaea viscosa subsp. spatulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved hop bush, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often broader than long, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, bead-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry inland regions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and used in landscaping."
