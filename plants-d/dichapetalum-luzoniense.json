    "intro": "Dichapetalum luzoniense, commonly known as the Luzon spider flower, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, spider-like inflorescence composed of small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a dense, umbrella-like cluster. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers bloom in clusters at the ends of branches, making it a visually distinctive species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range."
