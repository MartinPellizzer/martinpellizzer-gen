    "intro": "Drosera filiformis var. floridana, commonly known as the Florida slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, thread-like leaves covered in sticky glands that secrete a sugary substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. It produces small, white flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
