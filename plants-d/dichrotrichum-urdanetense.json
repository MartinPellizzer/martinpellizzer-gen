    "intro": "Dichrotrichum urdanetense, commonly known as the Urda net grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and coastal areas. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Dichrotrichum urdanetense is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
