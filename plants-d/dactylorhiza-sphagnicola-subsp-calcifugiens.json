    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sphagnicola subsp. calcifugiens, commonly known as the calcifuge marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific wetland habitats. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, greenish or yellowish flowers. This subspecies thrives in acidic, peaty soils and is typically associated with sphagnum moss-dominated environments. Its growth is closely linked to the presence of specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
