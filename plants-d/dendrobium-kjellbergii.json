    "intro": "Dendrobium kjellbergii, commonly known as the Kjellberg's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the summer months. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Dendrobium kjellbergii is also valued for its resilience and ability to bloom repeatedly over time."
