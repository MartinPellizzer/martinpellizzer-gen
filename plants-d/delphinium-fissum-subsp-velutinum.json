    "intro": "Delphinium fissum subsp. velutinum, commonly known as the velvet larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking cobalt-blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a velvety texture, giving it its common name. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
