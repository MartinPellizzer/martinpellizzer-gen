    "intro": "Dithecina terrestris, commonly known as the ground-dwelling moss, is a small, low-growing plant belonging to the family Dithecinae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or along rocky outcrops. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with closely packed, greenish-brown shoots. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a distinct midrib and a slightly curled tip. It reproduces through spores, which are released from tiny, clustered capsules that develop on the stems."
