    "intro": "Deparia acuta, commonly known as the acute fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Deparia acuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
