    "intro": "Digitaria digitata, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, silver-colored foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Digitaria digitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
