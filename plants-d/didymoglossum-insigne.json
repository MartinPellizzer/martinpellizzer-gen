    "intro": "Didymoglossum insigne, commonly known as the showy spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Didymoglossum insigne is a short-lived perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
