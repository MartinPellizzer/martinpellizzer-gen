    "intro": "Dryopteris afra, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to spread through vegetative propagation. The fronds are divided into segments with a distinctive, almost triangular shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
