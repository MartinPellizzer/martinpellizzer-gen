    "intro": "Dracaena reflexa var. parvifolia, commonly known as the Song of India or the laceleaf dracaena, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features narrow, dark green, waxy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily cultivated for its foliage rather than its blooms. It is highly tolerant of low light conditions and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor environments contribute to its widespread popularity as a decorative plant."
