    "intro": "Dracula trinema, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and striking, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its specialized leaf structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the canopy of dense forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Dracula trinema is considered a conservation concern."
