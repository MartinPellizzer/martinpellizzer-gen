    "intro": "Dasylirion longissimum, commonly known as the threadleaf yucca, is a striking evergreen perennial native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features long, narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 6 feet in length, giving it a distinctive, architectural appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences of white to pale blue flowers in late spring or early summer. Its foliage is covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Dasylirion longissimum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
