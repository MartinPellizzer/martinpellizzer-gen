    "intro": "Desmodium delotum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf desmodium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, pink to purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Desmodium delotum is also valued for its potential in soil improvement and as a forage crop."
