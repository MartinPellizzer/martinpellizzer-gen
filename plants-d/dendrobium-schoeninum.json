    "intro": "Dendrobium schoeninum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, wiry stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often covered in a dense layer of white or brown hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium schoeninum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
