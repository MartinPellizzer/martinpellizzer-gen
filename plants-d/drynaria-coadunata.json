    "intro": "Drynaria coadunata, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a layer of old fronds, giving it a tree-like appearance. The plant has a rhizome that grows underground, supporting the growth of its fronds. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a feathery appearance, and they grow in a spiral pattern around the trunk. Drynaria coadunata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas."
