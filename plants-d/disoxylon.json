    "intro": "Disoxylon, commonly known as the \"spiny tree\" or \"cactus tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America, particularly in countries like Bolivia and Peru. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted for water storage. Disoxylon species often grow as shrubs or small trees, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry environments."
