    "intro": "Dekinia, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Dekinia prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
