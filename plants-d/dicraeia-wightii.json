    "intro": "Dicraeia wightii, commonly known as the Indian white sand orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in open forested areas. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the poor soil conditions in which it thrives. Dicraeia wightii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
