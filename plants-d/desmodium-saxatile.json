    "intro": "Desmodium saxatile, commonly known as the rock dodder, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is often found growing on limestone or sandstone substrates, showcasing its adaptation to harsh, nutrient-poor soils. It has a creeping habit with aerial stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky surfaces. Desmodium saxatile is also notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
