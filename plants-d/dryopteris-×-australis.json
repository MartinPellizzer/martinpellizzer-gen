    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 australis, commonly known as the Australian shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris australis and Dryopteris filix-mas. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a dark green color and a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions of Australia. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
