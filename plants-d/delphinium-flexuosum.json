    "intro": "Delphinium flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with clusters of spurred blue or purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
