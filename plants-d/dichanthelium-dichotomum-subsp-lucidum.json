    "intro": "Dichanthelium dichotomum subsp. lucidum, commonly known as the glossy dichotomous grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are narrow with a smooth, waxy surface. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is distinguished by its glossy appearance and is often found in association with other wetland plants."
