    "intro": "Dryopteris parasparsa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
