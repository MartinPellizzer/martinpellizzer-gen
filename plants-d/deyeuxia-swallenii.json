    "intro": "Deyeuxia swallenii, commonly known as the Swallen's flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It is often found in coastal regions and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and brackish water conditions. Deyeuxia swallenii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
