    "intro": "Diplocaulobium tuberculatum, commonly known as the tuberculate fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves. The plant's unique tuberculate (bumpy) surface on its leaves is a distinguishing botanical feature."
