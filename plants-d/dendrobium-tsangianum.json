    "intro": "Dendrobium tsangianum, commonly known as the Tsangian orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in summer, producing white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
