It features long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white stripes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red berries. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and minimal watering requirements. Its upright growth habit makes it an attractive choice for both container gardening and landscape design."
