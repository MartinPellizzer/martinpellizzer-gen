    "intro": "Daphne parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features aromatic, glandular leaves that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, usually blooming in late winter to early spring. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and showy, long-lasting flowers. Daphne parviflora is often cultivated in gardens for its winter interest and delicate beauty."
