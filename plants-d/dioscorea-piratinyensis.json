    "intro": "Dioscorea piratinyensis, commonly known as the Piratinyen yam, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part of the plant. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically followed by spiny capsules containing several seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and tend to climb using tendrils. This species is valued not only for its culinary uses but also for its potential medicinal properties."
