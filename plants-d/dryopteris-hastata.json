    "intro": "Dryopteris hastata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and leathery fronds that resemble a sword, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily recognizable in its natural habitat."
