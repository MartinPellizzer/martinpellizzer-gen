It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of spiny, velvety bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. Dipsacus auriculatus is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including fields and woodland edges."
