    "intro": "Diplolepis diemii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to parts of eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agroforestry systems."
