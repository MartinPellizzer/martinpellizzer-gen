    "intro": "Delphinium \u00d7 belladonna, commonly known as the hybrid larkspur, is a perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of striking blue, purple, or white flowers. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its foliage consists of palmately compound leaves with finely divided lobes, and it produces showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
