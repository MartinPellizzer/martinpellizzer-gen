    "intro": "Distomomischus, commonly known as the spiral lily, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves. It belongs to the family Araceae and is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. The plant features a short, stout stem with broad, waxy leaves that curl into a spiral pattern. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
