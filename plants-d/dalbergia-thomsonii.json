    "intro": "Dalbergia thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's African rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid, well-drained soils. It produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by pod fruits containing several seeds. The tree is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root system."
