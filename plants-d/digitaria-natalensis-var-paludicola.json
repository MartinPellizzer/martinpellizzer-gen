    "intro": "Digitaria natalensis var. paludicola, commonly known as the swamp digitaria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It typically grows in marshy or seasonally flooded areas, adapting to waterlogged soils with its fibrous root system. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny grains of grass seed. It is often found in association with other wetland vegetation, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for stabilizing soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic ecosystems."
