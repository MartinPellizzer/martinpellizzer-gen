    "intro": "Draba \u00d7 algida var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-seeded rockcress, is a hybrid plant species within the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and compact rosette of basal leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, typically blooming before the leaves fully expand. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its often harsh, alpine or rocky habitats. This variant is notable for its geographic distribution across the European Alps and parts of Central Asia."
