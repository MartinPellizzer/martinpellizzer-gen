    "intro": "Darea polypodioides, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Darea polypodioides plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
