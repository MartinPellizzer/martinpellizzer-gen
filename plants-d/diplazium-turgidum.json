    "intro": "Diplazium turgidum, commonly known as the broadleaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces floating or submerged fronds, which are usually broad and pinnate. Its leaves are often rich in nutrients and can provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Diplazium turgidum plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing excess nutrients and oxygenating the water."
