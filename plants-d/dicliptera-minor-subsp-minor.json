It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It is typically found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and grassy areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
