    "intro": "Desmodium callianthum, commonly known as the silverleaf desmodium, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with a silvery underside, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
