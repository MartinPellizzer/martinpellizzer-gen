    "intro": "Dalea tapacariensis, commonly known as the Andean burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny pods and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its adaptations to high-altitude environments include compact growth and a deep root system for water absorption. Dalea tapacariensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife in its native range."
