    "intro": "Dichanthelium sciurotis, commonly known as the grayhair panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-awned flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
