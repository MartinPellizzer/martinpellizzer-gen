    "intro": "Dracunculus divaricatus, commonly known as the meadow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often with a distinctive, cup-shaped structure. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. Dracunculus divaricatus is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and wetlands, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
