    "intro": "Dioscorea neglecta, commonly known as the wild yam, is a perennial vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by cylindrical, spiny fruits containing toxic seeds. Its tuberous roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties and historical use in traditional medicine. However, due to its toxic compounds, it requires careful handling and processing before use."
