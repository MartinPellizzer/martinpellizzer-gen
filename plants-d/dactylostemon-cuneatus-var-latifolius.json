    "intro": "Dactylostemon cuneatus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leafed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. The leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
