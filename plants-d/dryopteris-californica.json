    "intro": "Dryopteris californica, commonly known as the California wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to western North America. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped pinnae with a serrated edge, and they are usually dark green with a glossy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant produces spores in small, clustered clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the spring and summer months."
