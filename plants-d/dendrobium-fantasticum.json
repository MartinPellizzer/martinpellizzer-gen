    "intro": "Dendrobium fantasticum, commonly known as the fantastic orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with intricate patterns. It has long, segmented stems that can store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural enthusiasts and botanical studies."
