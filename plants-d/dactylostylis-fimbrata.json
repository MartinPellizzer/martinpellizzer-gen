    "intro": "Dactylostylis fimbrata, commonly known as the coastal daisy or sea daisy, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. It is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate moderate drought conditions, making it well-suited to coastal ecosystems. The flowers attract various pollinators, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
