    "intro": "Dryopteris consimilis, commonly known as the similar wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris consimilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
