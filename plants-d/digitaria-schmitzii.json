    "intro": "Digitaria schmitzii, commonly known as silverhair grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Digitaria schmitzii is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in erosion control due to its hardy nature."
