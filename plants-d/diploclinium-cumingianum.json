It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and forest margins. The species is noted for its latex-like sap, which can be milky and is exuded when the plant is damaged."
