    "intro": "Diospyros microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark gray bark and elliptical, glossy leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange to red, edible fruits with a sweet, sometimes astringent flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in gardens and for local food use."
