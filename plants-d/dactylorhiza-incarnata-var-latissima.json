    "intro": "Dactylorhiza incarnata var. latissima, commonly known as the broad-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers with prominent, hairy sepals and petals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in many regions."
