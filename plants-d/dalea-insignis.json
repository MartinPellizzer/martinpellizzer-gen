It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Dalea insignis plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
