    "intro": "Dendrobium gaudens, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a red or purple lip. Its inflorescence typically consists of several flowers arranged along a spike. Dendrobium gaudens prefers warm, humid environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
