    "intro": "Delphinium pycnocentrum, commonly known as the dense-flowered larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated margins, and its roots are fibrous and somewhat tuberous. Delphinium pycnocentrum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a striking addition to alpine gardens."
