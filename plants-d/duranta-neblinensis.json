    "intro": "Duranta neblinensis, commonly known as the misty duranta, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which are followed by blue or purple berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Duranta neblinensis is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for a variety of garden settings."
