    "intro": "Dicranophlebia, commonly known as the clubmoss, is an ancient group of spore-bearing plants that belong to the order Lepidoziellales. These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and their ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Dicranophlebia species are typically found in temperate regions, often growing in dense mats on the forest floor. They play a significant role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various microorganisms. Despite their historical prevalence, many species are now threatened due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
