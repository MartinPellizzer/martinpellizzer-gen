    "intro": "Dicellandra erecta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Dicellandra erecta is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands. Its wood is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally by Indigenous Australians."
