    "intro": "Davallia dicksonioides, commonly known as the Dickson's water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizomes are short and produce small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
