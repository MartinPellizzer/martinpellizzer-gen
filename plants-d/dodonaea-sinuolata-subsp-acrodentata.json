    "intro": "Dodonaea sinuolata subsp. acrodentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hop bush, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody capsules containing seeds. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
