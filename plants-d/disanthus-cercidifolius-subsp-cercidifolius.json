    "intro": "Disanthus cercidifolius subsp. cercidifolius, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, typically in shades of red or pink. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
