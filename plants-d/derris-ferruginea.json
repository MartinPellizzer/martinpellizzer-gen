    "intro": "Derris ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty derris, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Leguminosae (Fabaceae), characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is notable for its distinctive rust-colored bark and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators. The plant has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of rotenone in its seeds."
