    "intro": "Dryopteris parallela, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into segments with a distinctive shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
