    "intro": "Dipterocarpus stellatus subsp. parvus, commonly known as the small-flowered dipterocarp, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae, which includes many important rainforest trees. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. It plays a significant role in the ecological structure of its native habitats, contributing to biodiversity and carbon sequestration. The subspecies parvus is distinguished by its smaller flowers and leaves compared to the typical form of Dipterocarpus stellatus."
