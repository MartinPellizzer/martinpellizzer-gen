    "intro": "Dalea mutabilis, commonly known as the variable milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and even red. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like pods that contain its seeds. Dalea mutabilis is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in its native environment."
