    "intro": "Dicoma zeyheri, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in winter. The plant has silvery-gray foliage, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its arid environment. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Dicoma zeyheri is often used in rock gardens and as a container plant due to its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
