    "intro": "Dysoxylum robertsii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often waxy bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
