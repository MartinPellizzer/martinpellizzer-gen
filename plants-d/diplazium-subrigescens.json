    "intro": "Diplazium subrigescens, commonly known as the rough serrated fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its pinnately compound fronds with serrated margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, allowing it to thrive in humid conditions. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its adaptability in tropical climates."
