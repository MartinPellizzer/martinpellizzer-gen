It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as forest floors or swampy areas. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are clustered in inflorescences and are pollinated primarily by insects."
