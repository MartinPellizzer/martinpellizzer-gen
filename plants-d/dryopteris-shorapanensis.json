    "intro": "Dryopteris shorapanensis, commonly known as the Shorapanensis wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate or tripinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. The plant's botanical structure reflects its adaptation to moist, tropical climates, making it a distinctive member of the fern family."
