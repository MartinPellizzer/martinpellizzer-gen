    "intro": "Dorstenia pseudo-opifera, commonly known as the false arrowroot, is a member of the Moraceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not widely cultivated due to its specific care requirements."
