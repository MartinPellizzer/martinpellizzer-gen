    "intro": "Duranta recurvistachys, commonly known as the silverleaf duranta, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow or orange, depending on the variety. These flowers are followed by blue or violet berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. Duranta recurvistachys is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
