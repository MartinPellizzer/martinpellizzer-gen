    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa var. variegata, commonly known as variable tussock grass, is a variant of the tufted hairgrass species. It is characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage, featuring a mix of green and white or silver hues along the leaf blades. This plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as meadows, fields, and along roadsides. It forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, wiry stems that often bend at the base. The inflorescence consists of a loose, cylindrical spikelet that bears small, spike-like flowers, typical of the Poaceae family."
