    "intro": "Dracaena chelsonii, commonly known as the Red-veined Dracaena, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that often display vibrant red veins against a deep green background. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Dracaena chelsonii is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
