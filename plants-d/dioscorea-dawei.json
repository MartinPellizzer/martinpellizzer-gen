    "intro": "Dioscorea dawei, commonly known as the Chinese yam, is a tuberous plant belonging to the Dioscoreaceae family. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves and bears small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into capsule fruits. Its underground tubers are the primary economically important part, valued for their medicinal and culinary uses. The tubers are rich in starch and have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported health benefits."
