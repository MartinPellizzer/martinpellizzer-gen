    "intro": "Diospyros kaki var. glabra, commonly known as the Japanese persimmon, is a deciduous fruit tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn and its smooth, glabrous bark. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fruits that ripen to a sweet, orange-red color. The fruit is typically harvested in the fall and is prized for its honey-like flavor and soft, non-astringent texture. It is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
