    "intro": "Dryopteris varia, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Dryopteris varia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
