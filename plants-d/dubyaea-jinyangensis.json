It is characterized by its striking dichotomous branching pattern, which resembles the yin-yang symbol, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a delicate appearance to its structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
