    "intro": "Dryopteris acromanes, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it receives dappled sunlight. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are covered in tiny, specialized structures called sorus."
