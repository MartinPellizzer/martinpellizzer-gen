    "intro": "Dendromyza nivalis, commonly known as the snow lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in cold, high-altitude environments. It is a composite organism consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This lichen is often found on rock surfaces or tree bark in arctic and alpine regions. Its slow growth rate and ability to survive extreme conditions make it an indicator species for environmental stability. The plant's structure is simple, with a crust-like thallus that allows it to adhere tightly to surfaces in harsh climates."
