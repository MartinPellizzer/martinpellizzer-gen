It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, bean-like pods that contain its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its ecological value includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
