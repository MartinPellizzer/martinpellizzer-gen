    "intro": "Dryopteris fragrans var. remotiuscula, commonly known as the fragrant wood fern, is a variant of the fragrant fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically dark green with a subtle, aromatic scent when crushed. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are arranged in lines on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus."
