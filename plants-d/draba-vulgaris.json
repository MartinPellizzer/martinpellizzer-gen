    "intro": "Draba vulgaris, commonly known as the common whitlowgrass, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is typically found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, across temperate regions. It is an annual or biennial herb that thrives in cool, moist environments. Draba vulgaris is notable for its ability to tolerate harsh conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
