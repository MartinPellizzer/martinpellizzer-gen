    "intro": "Daucus nodosus, commonly known as the nodding parsley, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and prefers well-drained soils. Its fruit is a small, oval-shaped schizocarp that splits into two one-seeded parts when mature. Daucus nodosus is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is considered a minor weed in some areas."
