    "intro": "Digitaria rottleri, commonly known as the Rottler's digitaria, is a species of grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Digitaria rottleri is generally drought-tolerant and has adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
