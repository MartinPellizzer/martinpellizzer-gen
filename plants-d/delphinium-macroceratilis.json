    "intro": "Delphinium macroceratilis, commonly known as the giant helmet larkspur, is a striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy flowers. The flowers typically bloom in shades of blue, purple, and white, with a distinctive helmet-shaped upper petal. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be toxic to livestock."
