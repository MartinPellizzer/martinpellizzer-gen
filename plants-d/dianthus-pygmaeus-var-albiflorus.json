    "intro": "Dianthus pygmaeus var. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered dwarf carnation, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, clustered flowers with white petals and prominent pink or red stamens, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. This variety is prized for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
