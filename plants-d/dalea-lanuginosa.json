    "intro": "Dalea lanuginosa, commonly known as the wooly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its finely hairy, gray-green leaves and small, pink to reddish-purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Dalea lanuginosa is a perennial legume, meaning it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
