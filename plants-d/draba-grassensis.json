    "intro": "Draba grassensis, commonly known as the Siberian rockcress, is a small flowering plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants, and is characterized by its delicate, basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Draba grassensis is adapted to harsh climates, with a short growing season and the ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its presence is an indicator of ecological health in arctic and subarctic environments."
