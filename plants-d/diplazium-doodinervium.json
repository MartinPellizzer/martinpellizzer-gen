    "intro": "Diplazium doodinervium, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds with a distinctive venation pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in maintaining soil stability in its habitat. The narrow-veined structure of its leaves is a key identifying feature."
