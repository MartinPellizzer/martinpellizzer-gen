    "intro": "Dorstenia usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambara mountain fig, is a flowering plant native to the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into fleshy, fig-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests at elevations between 1,200 and 2,000 meters. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for both horticultural and conservation purposes."
