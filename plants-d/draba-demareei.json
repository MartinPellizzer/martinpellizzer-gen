    "intro": "Draba demareei, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada whitlowgrass, is a small flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, clustered flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, alpine environment. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing bright yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Draba demareei is considered a rare and sensitive species."
