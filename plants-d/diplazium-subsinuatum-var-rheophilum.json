    "intro": "Diplazium subsinuatum var. rheophilum, commonly known as the water fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed water fern native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its feathery, delicate fronds that are typically submerged or floating, adapting to aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively through underground stems. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that provide a dense, lush appearance. This variety is often found in slow-moving freshwater systems and is valued for its ornamental qualities in water gardens."
