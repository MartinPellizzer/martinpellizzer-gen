    "intro": "Derris torrensis, commonly known as the Torrens derris, is a climbing shrub native to northern Australia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain seeds with a distinctive, toxic alkaloid called derrisine. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
