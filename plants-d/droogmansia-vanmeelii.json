    "intro": "Droogmansia vanmeelii, commonly known as the Van Meel's droogmansia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high Andes of Peru. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late summer. Its adaptability to high-altitude environments makes it a unique subject for botanical study. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
