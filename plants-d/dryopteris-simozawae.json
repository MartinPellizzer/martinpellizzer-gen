    "intro": "Dryopteris simozawae, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, clustered spore sacs on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the dry season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its lush, dense foliage."
