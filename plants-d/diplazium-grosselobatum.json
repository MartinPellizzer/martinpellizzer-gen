    "intro": "Diplazium grosselobatum, commonly known as the broad-lobed sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped fronds that are typically divided into broad, lobed segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are usually dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it withstand humid conditions."
