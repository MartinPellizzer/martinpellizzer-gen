    "intro": "Dorstenia holstii, commonly known as the \"Cape Cod plant,\" is a unique member of the Moraceae family, native to South Africa. It is a perennial herb with a distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that resemble the structure of a cactus, though it is not a true cactus. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a dense inflorescence, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its leaves are succulent and can store water, making it somewhat drought-tolerant. Despite its appearance, it is not closely related to the cacti family and has a different evolutionary lineage."
