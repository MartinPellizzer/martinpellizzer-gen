    "intro": "Drosera rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stemmed sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its reddish stems and sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant's leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that secrete a sticky substance to immobilize prey. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Drosera rubiginosa is known for its ability to digest trapped insects, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils."
