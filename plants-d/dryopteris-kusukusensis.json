    "intro": "Dryopteris kusukusensis, commonly known as the Kusukusen fern, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a medium-sized fern with fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant features a distinctive, intricate frond structure with a bipinnate arrangement of leaflets. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle in the dense forest understory."
