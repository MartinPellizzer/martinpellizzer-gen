    "intro": "Dicranopygium pygmaeum subsp. pygmaeum, commonly known as the small pygmy moss, is a small, creeping moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. It has a dense, cushion-like growth form, with leafy shoots that are often less than 2 centimeters in length. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces small, club-shaped capsules that are typically borne on short, lateral stalks. This subspecies is often found in forest floors, rock crevices, and other humid microhabitats where it plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention."
