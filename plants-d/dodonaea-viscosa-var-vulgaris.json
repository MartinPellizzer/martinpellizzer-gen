    "intro": "Dodonaea viscosa var. vulgaris, commonly known as the coastal honeysuckle, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa, Australia, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in coastal landscaping and erosion control."
