    "intro": "Diplazium affine, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often borne on long, arching stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Diplazium affine is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
