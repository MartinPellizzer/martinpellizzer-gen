    "intro": "Dasiphora tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf mountain avens, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a raceme. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
