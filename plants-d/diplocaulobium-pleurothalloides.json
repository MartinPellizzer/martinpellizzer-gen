    "intro": "Diplocaulobium pleurothalloides, commonly known as the broad-leafed liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which consists of a flat, ribbon-like body that is typically green and photosynthetic. The plant exhibits a dichotomous branching pattern, with both the dorsal and ventral surfaces bearing distinct leaf-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, including both male and female gametophytes, are closely integrated within the thallus."
