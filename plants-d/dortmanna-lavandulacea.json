    "intro": "Dortmanna lavandulacea, commonly known as the lavender moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage with a soft, velvety texture. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves arranged in two rows along the stems, and it produces tiny, capsule-like sporangia that release spores for reproduction. It is often found in rocky crevices, forest floors, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention. Due to its delicate nature, it is typically cultivated in controlled environments or as a specialty garden plant."
