    "intro": "Draba johannis, commonly known as the Johann's rockcress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the alpine regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous environments. It produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
