    "intro": "Deyeuxia nitidula, commonly known as the glossy sedge, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often glossy in appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Deyeuxia nitidula is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
