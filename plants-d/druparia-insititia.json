    "intro": "Druparia insititia, commonly known as the obscure drupaceae, is a member of the Prunus genus, characterized by its fleshy, drupaceous fruits. It typically features a single seed enclosed within a hard, stony endocarp, a defining trait of the drupe fruit type. The plant exhibits a woody structure with simple, alternate leaves and produces small, white or pink flowers. It is native to temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soil with partial sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and often overlooked species within the drupaceae family."
