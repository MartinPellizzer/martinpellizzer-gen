    "intro": "Dichromena reptans, commonly known as the creeping dichromena, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy and have a dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively along the ground. Dichromena reptans is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks."
