    "intro": "Diplaziopsis flavoviridis, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often display a yellowish-green hue. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Diplaziopsis flavoviridis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
