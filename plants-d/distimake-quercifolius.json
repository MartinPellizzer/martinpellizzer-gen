    "intro": "Distimake quercifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf shade tree, is a deciduous plant native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that resemble those of the oak, hence its scientific name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits. Its deep root system makes it highly drought-resistant and suitable for urban landscaping. The leaves turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall, adding ornamental value to the landscape."
