    "intro": "Dryopteris asplenioides f. exindusiata, commonly known as the exindusiated maidenhair fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to regions of East Asia, including China and Japan. The fronds are typically arching and have a light green color, with a distinctive, finely serrated margin. The sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a thin, membranous indusium. This fern prefers moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
