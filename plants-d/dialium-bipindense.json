    "intro": "Dialium bipindense, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, round fruits that turn from green to yellow when mature. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, aromatic aril, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The tree is valued for its timber and is often found in moist, semi-deciduous forests."
