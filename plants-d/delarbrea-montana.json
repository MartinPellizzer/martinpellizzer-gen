    "intro": "Delarbrea montana, commonly known as the mountain delarbrea, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
