It is characterized by its submerged, ribbon-like leaves that are typically smooth and slightly ribbed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually borne in clusters near the water surface. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its botanical structure supports its role as a primary producer in aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
