    "intro": "Dendrobium deltatum, commonly known as the delta orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a red or purple throat. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
