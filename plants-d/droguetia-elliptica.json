    "intro": "Droguetia elliptica, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Droguetia elliptica is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and marshy areas. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a notable species in ecological studies."
