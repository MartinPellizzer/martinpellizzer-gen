    "intro": "Dumasia glaucescens, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its hairy, blue-green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its foliage often has a waxy coating, which gives it a distinctive, almost silvery appearance. Dumasia glaucescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
