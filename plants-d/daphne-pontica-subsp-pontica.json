    "intro": "Daphne pontica subsp. pontica, commonly known as the Caucasian daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the Caucasus region. It features dense, aromatic foliage with dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, preferring cooler climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can be toxic to humans and animals."
