It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, marshes, and wet meadows. The plant forms dense, tufted clumps with fine, needle-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a single, slender spikelet that is slightly drooping and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
