    "intro": "Draba crockeri, commonly known as the Crocker's whitlow grass, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Draba crockeri is considered a vulnerable species."
