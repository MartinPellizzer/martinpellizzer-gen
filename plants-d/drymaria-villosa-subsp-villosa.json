    "intro": "Drymaria villosa subsp. villosa, commonly known as hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually oval or rounded, with a soft, velvety texture due to the fine hairs covering them. The subspecies villosa is distinguished by its more pronounced hairy covering compared to other subspecies of Drymaria."
