    "intro": "Dicranopygium idrobonis, commonly known as the Idrobone moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green to reddish-brown foliage. The plant features elongated, stiff leaves with a distinct costa, and it produces small, capsule-like sporangia that are typically clustered in groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on the forest floor. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
