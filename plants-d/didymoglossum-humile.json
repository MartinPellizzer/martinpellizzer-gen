    "intro": "Didymoglossum humile, commonly known as the small-leafed moss, is a member of the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. It is a small, terrestrial moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has short, spirally arranged leaves that are often covered with a layer of papillae, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, spore-bearing capsules that are typically borne on short, erect stems. Didymoglossum humile is well adapted to humid, temperate climates and is often found in regions with high moisture levels."
