    "intro": "Dopatrium senegalense, commonly known as the Senegalese sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. It has a shallow root system that helps it survive in sandy and nutrient-poor soils. Dopatrium senegalense is often found in disturbed areas and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
