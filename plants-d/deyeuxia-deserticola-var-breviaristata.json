    "intro": "Deyeuxia deserticola var. breviaristata, commonly known as the short-bracted desert grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert environments and is often found in dunes and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of the vegetation in its native habitat."
