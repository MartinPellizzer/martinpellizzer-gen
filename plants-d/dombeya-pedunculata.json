It is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and a woody stem covered in fine, downy hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental shrubs. Dombeya pedunculata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
