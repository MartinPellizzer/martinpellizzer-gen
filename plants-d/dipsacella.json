    "intro": "Dipsacella, commonly known as wood sage, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caprifoliaceae. These plants are typically herbaceous or shrubby and are characterized by their opposite, simple leaves and showy, tubular or bell-shaped flowers. The flowers often come in clusters and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees and butterflies. Dipsacella species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in woodland or grassland habitats. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinator populations."
