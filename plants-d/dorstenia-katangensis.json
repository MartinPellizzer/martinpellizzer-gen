    "intro": "Dorstenia katangensis, commonly known as the Katanga mountain fig, is a flowering plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often ribbed leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically found at the base of the leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
