    "intro": "Dendrobium bigibbum var. sumneri, commonly known as the Sumner's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
