    "intro": "Doronicum nudicaule, commonly known as the slender leopard's bane, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its delicate, nodding yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or open woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spiny fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
