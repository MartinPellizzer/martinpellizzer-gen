    "intro": "Diplopappus baccharoides, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by feathery seeds dispersed by the wind. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources and survive prolonged droughts. This species plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
