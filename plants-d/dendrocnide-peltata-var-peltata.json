    "intro": "Dendrocnide peltata var. peltata, commonly known as the stinging tree, is a flowering plant native to northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. These trichomes secrete a potent irritant, causing severe skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in rainforest and coastal scrub environments, often growing as an upright shrub or small tree."
