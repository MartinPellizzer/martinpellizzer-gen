    "intro": "Desmodium laxiflorum var. formosense, commonly known as the Taiwan velvet bean, is a perennial legume native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pale yellow to green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a sprawling growth habit and produces elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
