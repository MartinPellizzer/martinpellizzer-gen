    "intro": "Dianthus fimbriatus var. canescens, commonly known as the fringed campion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers with fringed petals that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
