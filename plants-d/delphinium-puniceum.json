    "intro": "Delphinium puniceum, commonly known as the crimson larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of vivid purple to pink flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are serrated and arranged alternately along the stem. Delphinium puniceum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock and humans."
