    "intro": "Dendrocnide excelsa, commonly known as the giant stinging tree, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a member of the Dendrocnide genus, which is part of the Asteraceae family. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. It is notable for its toxic sap, which contains potent urushiol-like compounds that can cause severe skin irritation. Due to its defensive properties, it is often found in moist, shaded areas of rainforests."
