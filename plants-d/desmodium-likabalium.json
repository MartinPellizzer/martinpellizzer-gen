    "intro": "Desmodium likabalium, commonly known as the African needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in grasslands and woodland areas, thriving in well-drained soils. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
