    "intro": "Dendrobium tetrodon, commonly known as the four-spined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a tall, slender stem with a distinctive four-ridged structure, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a subtle fragrance. Dendrobium tetrodon is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
