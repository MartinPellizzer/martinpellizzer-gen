    "intro": "Drusa glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular drusa, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, clustered inflorescences of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has glandular structures on its stems and leaves, which secrete oils and may play a role in deterring herbivores. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Drusa glandulosa is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun."
