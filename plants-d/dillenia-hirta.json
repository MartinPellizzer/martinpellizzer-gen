    "intro": "Dillenia hirta, commonly known as the hairy dillenia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that are edible and often consumed by birds and small mammals. Dillenia hirta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or near water bodies. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits."
