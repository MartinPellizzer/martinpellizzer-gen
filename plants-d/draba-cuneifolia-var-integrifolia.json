    "intro": "Draba cuneifolia var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf whitlow grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and possesses basal leaves that are lance-shaped and smooth-edged. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, appearing in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens."
