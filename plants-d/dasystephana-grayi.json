    "intro": "Dasystephana grayi, commonly known as the gray's dasystephana, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub with woody stems and elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, bloom in clusters and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
