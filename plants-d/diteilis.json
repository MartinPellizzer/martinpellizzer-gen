    "intro": "Diteilis, commonly known as the golden cup, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange inflorescences that resemble small cups, hence its common name. The plants are native to southern Africa, where they thrive in dry, sunny environments. Diteilis species typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
