    "intro": "Desmodium huillensis, commonly known as Huill\u00e9n's desmodium, is a flowering plant species belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Central America and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in the region. Desmodium huillensis is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a potential forage plant."
