    "intro": "Dicksonia nephrolepioides, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, tree-like trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a thick, fibrous root system that helps anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are bi-directionally compound, with a distinctive, glossy green color and a rough, hairy texture on the underside. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and plays a role in traditional medicine in some regions."
