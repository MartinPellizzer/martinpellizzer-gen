    "intro": "Dennstaedtia rubiginosa, commonly known as the rusty fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a reddish-brown coloration on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce spore-bearing fronds that are often shorter than the sterile fronds. The rusty fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
