    "intro": "Disinstylis, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and yellow flower heads that resemble dandelions. Disinstylis species typically have small, strap-shaped leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. They are often found in open, disturbed habitats and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
