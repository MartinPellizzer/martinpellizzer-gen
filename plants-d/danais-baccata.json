    "intro": "Danais baccata, commonly known as the blackberry lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to pink. The plant produces small, dark berries that are edible but often have a bland flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed sites. Danais baccata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to naturalize in suitable environments."
