    "intro": "Dithyrea californica var. maritima, commonly known as the coastal dithyrea, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. This variant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shoreline, often in areas exposed to salt spray. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing delicate white or pale yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of coastal ecosystem health."
