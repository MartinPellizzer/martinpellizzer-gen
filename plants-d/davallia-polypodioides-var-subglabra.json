    "intro": "Davallia polypodioides var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-leafed maidenhair fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, glossy, and lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a loose, cascading form. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The varietal name 'subglabra' refers to its smoother leaf surface compared to other varieties of Davallia."
