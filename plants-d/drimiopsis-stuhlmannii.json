    "intro": "Drimiopsis stuhlmannii, commonly known as the Stuhlmann's drimiopsis, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to South Africa, specifically the Eastern Cape region, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically greenish-white with a distinctive yellowish throat, blooming in late summer. Drimiopsis stuhlmannii is adapted to withstand drought and can go dormant during dry periods, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
