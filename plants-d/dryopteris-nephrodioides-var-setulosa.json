    "intro": "Dryopteris nephrodioides var. setulosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern characterized by its distinctive hairy fronds. It is native to the temperate regions of East Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a broad, shield-shaped outline and finely divided pinnae. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and shaded landscapes."
