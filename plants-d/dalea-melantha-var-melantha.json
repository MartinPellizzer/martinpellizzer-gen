    "intro": "Dalea melantha var. melantha, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in arid ecosystems."
