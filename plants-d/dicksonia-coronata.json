    "intro": "Dicksonia coronata, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a long lifespan and can grow up to several meters in height. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that helps it attract nocturnal pollinators. The silver fern is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens."
