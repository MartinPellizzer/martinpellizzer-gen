    "intro": "Dendrobium maleolens, commonly known as the golden torch orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with numerous bright yellow flowers that resemble torches. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often clustering at the base of the stems. Dendrobium maleolens is prized for its striking appearance and is cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and greenhouses."
