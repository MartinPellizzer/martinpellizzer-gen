    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudofibrillosa, commonly known as the false bird's nest fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, fan-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in high humidity. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
