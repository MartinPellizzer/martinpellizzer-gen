    "intro": "Dryopteris ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori fern, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Rwenzori Mountains in East Africa. It is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, large, and leathery fronds. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
