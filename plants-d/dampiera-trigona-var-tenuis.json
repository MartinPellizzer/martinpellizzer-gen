    "intro": "Dampiera trigona var. tenuis, commonly known as narrow-leaved dampiera, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Western Australia. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense spikes. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun conditions. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
