    "intro": "Deyeuxia crispa, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Deyeuxia crispa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
