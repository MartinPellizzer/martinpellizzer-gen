    "intro": "Dendrochilum merapiense, commonly known as the Merapi orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
