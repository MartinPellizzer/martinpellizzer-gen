    "intro": "Dioscorea alainii, commonly known as the Alain's yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for medicinal and nutritional purposes. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by capsule fruits. Its tubers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits, though they contain toxic compounds that require careful processing."
