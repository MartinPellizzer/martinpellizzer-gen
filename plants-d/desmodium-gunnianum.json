    "intro": "Desmodium gunnianum, commonly known as the coastal desmodium, is a perennial legume native to Australia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in open habitats such as dunes and heathlands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment. Its adaptability to coastal conditions makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
