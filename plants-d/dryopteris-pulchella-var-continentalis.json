    "intro": "Dryopteris pulchella var. continentalis, commonly known as the European hart's tongue fern, is a perennial fern native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves that are dark green and slightly curled at the edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its fronds are evergreen, providing a consistent foliage presence throughout the year. The sori, which are the clusters of spores, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
