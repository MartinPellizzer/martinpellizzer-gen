    "intro": "Didymocarpus flavobrunneus var. montanus, commonly known as the mountain yellow-brown acanthus, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically green with a yellowish-brown underside. The plant produces showy, spiny flower clusters that are usually pink to red in color, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
