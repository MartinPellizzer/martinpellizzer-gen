    "intro": "Dryopteris devriesei, commonly known as the Devriese's wood fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Indonesia and the Philippines. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
