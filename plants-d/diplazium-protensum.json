    "intro": "Diplazium protensum, commonly known as the broad-leafed chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender, and often branching fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. Diplazium protensum thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
