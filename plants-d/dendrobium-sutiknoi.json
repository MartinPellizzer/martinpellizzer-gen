    "intro": "Dendrobium sutiknoi, commonly known as the Sutikno's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in the summer, producing white or pale yellow blossoms with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
