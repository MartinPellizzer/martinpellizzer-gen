    "intro": "Dennstaedtia obtusifolia var. protrusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are typically arching and have a distinctive, sword-like shape. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This variant is notable for its robust growth and adaptability to various soil types, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
