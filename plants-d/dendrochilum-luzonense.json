    "intro": "Dendrochilum luzonense, commonly known as the Luzon tree orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its robust, tree-like growth habit, with thick, fleshy stems that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often appearing during the rainy season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded forest environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often found in protected areas."
