    "intro": "Dactyloides caespitosa, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its spine-tipped stems and clusters of yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces edible fruits called tunas, which are rich in nutrients and used in various culinary applications. Its thick, waxy leaves help it store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Dactyloides caespitosa also plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds."
