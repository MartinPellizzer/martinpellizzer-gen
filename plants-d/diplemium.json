    "intro": "Diplemium, commonly known as the common marsh fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, often hairy fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette or clustered form. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Diplemium species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet habitats."
