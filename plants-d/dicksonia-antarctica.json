    "intro": "Dicksonia antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic tree fern, is a species native to southern Australia and New Zealand. It is a large, evergreen fern that can grow up to 6 meters tall, with a stout, unbranched trunk covered in fibrous, dark brown to black bark. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a long, narrow, and often drooping shape. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its fronds, which are typically clustered in a spadix. Dicksonia antarctica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate rainforests."
