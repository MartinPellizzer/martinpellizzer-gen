    "intro": "Draba aizoides, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a small flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with distinctive four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that release seeds by wind. Draba aizoides is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
