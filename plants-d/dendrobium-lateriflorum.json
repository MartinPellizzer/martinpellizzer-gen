    "intro": "Dendrobium lateriflorum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry periods. Dendrobium lateriflorum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
