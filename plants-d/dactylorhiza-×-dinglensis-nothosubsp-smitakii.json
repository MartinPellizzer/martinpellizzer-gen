    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 dinglensis nothosubsp. smitakii, commonly known as the hybrid lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a tall, slender stem bearing a dense spike of violet to purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are arranged in a spiral pattern along the inflorescence. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
