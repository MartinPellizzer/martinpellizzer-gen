It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its rough, bark-like stem and simple, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing one or two seeds. The fruit is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of tannins. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas."
