It features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread horizontally and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
