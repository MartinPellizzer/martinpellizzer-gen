    "intro": "Dendrobium agrostophyllum, commonly known as the hairy leaf dendrobium, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, thin pseudobulbs covered in a dense, hairy coating that helps retain moisture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-draining soil. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for both horticultural and ecological studies."
