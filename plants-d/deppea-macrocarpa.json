    "intro": "Deppea macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited deppea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its woody stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Deppea macrocarpa is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical and subtropical regions."
