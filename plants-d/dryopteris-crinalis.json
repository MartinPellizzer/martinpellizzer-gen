    "intro": "Dryopteris crinalis, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble the shape of a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores in late summer. The Christmas fern is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland soils."
