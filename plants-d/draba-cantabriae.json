    "intro": "Draba cantabriae, commonly known as the Cantabrian whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant native to the Pyrenees and the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its delicate, basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring, which are arranged in a compact cluster. Draba cantabriae is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
