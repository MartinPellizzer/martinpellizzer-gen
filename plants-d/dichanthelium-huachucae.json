It is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescence and fine, needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
