    "intro": "Diplacus aurantius, commonly known as the hummingbird flower, is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds due to their shape and nectar-rich nature. Diplacus aurantius thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Its striking appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
