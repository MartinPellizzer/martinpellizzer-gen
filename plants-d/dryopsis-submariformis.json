    "intro": "Dryopsis submariformis, commonly known as the submarine dryopsis, is a rare and unique plant species adapted to aquatic environments. It is characterized by its specialized morphology, including thin, ribbon-like leaves that reduce resistance in water. The plant exhibits a submersed growth habit, with roots that anchor it to substrates in shallow aquatic habitats. Its reproductive structures are adapted for underwater pollination, though details remain poorly understood. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
