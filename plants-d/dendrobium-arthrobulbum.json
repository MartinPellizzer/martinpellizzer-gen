    "intro": "Dendrobium arthrobulbum, commonly known as the bamboo orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces raceme-like inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to yellow and pink. Its leaves are linear and arranged in two rows along the pseudobulbs. Dendrobium arthrobulbum thrives in shady, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
