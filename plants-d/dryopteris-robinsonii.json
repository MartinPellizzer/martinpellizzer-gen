    "intro": "Dryopteris robinsonii, commonly known as Robinson's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, slender structure. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
