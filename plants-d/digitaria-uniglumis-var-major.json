    "intro": "Digitaria uniglumis var. major, commonly known as large-seeded grass or broadleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open habitats such as disturbed soils, roadsides, and agricultural fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often clustered in panicles. Its seeds are small, with a distinctive shape and surface texture that aids in dispersal. It is often considered a weed in cultivated areas due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
