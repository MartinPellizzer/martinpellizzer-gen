    "intro": "Dalea bicolor, commonly known as the pink prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and prairies, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Dalea bicolor plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often used in native plant landscaping."
