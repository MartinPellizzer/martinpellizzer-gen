It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or alpine settings."
