    "intro": "Dacryodes tumacensis, commonly known as the Cuban ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas. It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood and evergreen foliage, which contributes to its ecological significance in forest ecosystems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, oblong fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
