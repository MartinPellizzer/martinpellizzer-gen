    "intro": "Dicksonia papuana, commonly known as the Papuan tree fern, is a large, upright fern native to the wet tropics of New Guinea and nearby islands. It can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring a stout, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant has a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, with a dark green, leathery texture. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
