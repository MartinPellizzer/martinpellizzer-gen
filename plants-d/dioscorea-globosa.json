    "intro": "Dioscorea globosa, commonly known as the globe yam, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in warm climates with high humidity. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, while its flowers are unisexual and clustered in catkins. The tubers of Dioscorea globosa are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits and are also a staple food in many indigenous communities."
