    "intro": "Dichanthium mccannii, commonly known as the desert grass or McCann's grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two bracts, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or degraded landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in dry environments."
