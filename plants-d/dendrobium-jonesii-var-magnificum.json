    "intro": "Dendrobium jonesii var. magnificum, commonly known as the magnificent orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many epiphytic orchid species. The plant produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often blooming during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
