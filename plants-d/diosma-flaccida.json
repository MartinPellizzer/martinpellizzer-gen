    "intro": "Diosma flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid diosma, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Diosma flaccida is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and can withstand periods of drought."
