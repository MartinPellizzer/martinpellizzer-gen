    "intro": "Dianthus fasciculatus, commonly known as the clustered pink or dwarf carnation, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, rosette-forming foliage and produces clusters of small, brightly colored flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant typically blooms from spring to early summer, and its flowers are often used in ornamental gardening for their vibrant appearance. Dianthus fasciculatus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical characteristics include hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions."
