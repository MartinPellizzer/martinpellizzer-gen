    "intro": "Drosera zigzagia, commonly known as the zigzag sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its zigzagging stems and sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wetlands. Its unique morphology and trapping mechanism make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
