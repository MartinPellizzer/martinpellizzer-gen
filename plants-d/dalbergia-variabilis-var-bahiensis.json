It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood with a rich, aromatic scent. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and hillside forests. Due to its high value for musical instrument making, it is also listed as an endangered species."
