    "intro": "Dryas incanescens, commonly known as the alpine rock rose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy, grayish-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its resilience and unique appearance, it is often found in alpine tundra and mountainous regions."
