    "intro": "Diplazium marginale, commonly known as the narrowleaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates in its habitat. Diplazium marginale is characterized by its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving waters, contributing to aquatic ecosystems."
