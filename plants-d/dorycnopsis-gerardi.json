    "intro": "Dorycnopsis gerardi, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces a tall, slender flowering stem topped with a single, yellow composite flower head. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing in open, sunny areas. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in nutrient-poor soils and withstand harsh climatic conditions."
