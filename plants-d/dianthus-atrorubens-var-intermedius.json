    "intro": "Dianthus atrorubens var. intermedius, commonly known as the Intermediate Blush Campion, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosy-pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in soft, hairy foliage, and its flowers are typically five-petaled, with a distinctive central cluster of stamens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
