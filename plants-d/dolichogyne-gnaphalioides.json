    "intro": "Dolichogyne gnaphalioides, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Dolichogyne gnaphalioides is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny environments."
