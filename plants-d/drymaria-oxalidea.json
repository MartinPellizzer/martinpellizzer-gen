    "intro": "Drymaria oxalidea, commonly known as the bluets or blueweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, delicate blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, often forming clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Its scientific name reflects its close relation to the oxalis family, characterized by its distinctive leaf structure and floral morphology. Drymaria oxalidea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
