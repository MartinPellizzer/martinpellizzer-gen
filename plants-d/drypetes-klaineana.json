    "intro": "Drypetes klaineana, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited natural range, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
