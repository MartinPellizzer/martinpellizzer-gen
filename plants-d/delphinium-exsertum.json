    "intro": "Delphinium exsertum, commonly known as the tall larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Delphinium exsertum is known for its toxic alkaloids, making it potentially poisonous to both humans and livestock."
