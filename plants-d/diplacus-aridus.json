    "intro": "Diplacus aridus, commonly known as the desert honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, tubular, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration. Diplacus aridus plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly hummingbirds and bees."
