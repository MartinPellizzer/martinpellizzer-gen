    "intro": "Dimorphandra cuprea subsp. ferruginea, commonly known as the red ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the dry regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark that ranges from reddish-brown to dark brown, giving it its common name. The leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern. It produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by flat, woody pods containing seeds. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional construction and crafts."
