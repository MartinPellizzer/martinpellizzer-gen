    "intro": "Dendrobium mirbelianum, commonly known as the Mirbel's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with fleshy, cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces erect inflorescences bearing showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation."
