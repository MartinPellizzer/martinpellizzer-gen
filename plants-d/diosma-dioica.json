    "intro": "Diosma dioica, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by legume-like pods containing seeds. Diosma dioica is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which has been traditionally used in woodworking and as a source of dye. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in many parts of its range."
