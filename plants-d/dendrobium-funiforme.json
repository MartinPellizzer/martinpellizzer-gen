    "intro": "Dendrobium funiforme, commonly known as the orchid with a funnelform lip, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically showy, with a distinctive lip that is often brightly colored and shaped like a funnel. Dendrobium funiforme is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
