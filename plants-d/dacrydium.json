    "intro": "Dacrydium, commonly known as the silver pine or mountain pine, is a genus of coniferous evergreen trees belonging to the family Podocarpaceae. These plants are characterized by their needle-like leaves and often produce small, spherical cones. Dacrydium species are typically found in temperate to tropical regions, particularly in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates. They play an important role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability. The wood of Dacrydium is valued for its durability and resistance to decay."
