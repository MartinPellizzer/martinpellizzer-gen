    "intro": "Dryandra nobilis, commonly known as the noble dryandra, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid conditions. Its unique floral structure and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping. However, it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and land clearing."
