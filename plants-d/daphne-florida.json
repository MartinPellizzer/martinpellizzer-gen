    "intro": "Daphne florida, commonly known as the spring daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a leathery texture. Daphne florida thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
