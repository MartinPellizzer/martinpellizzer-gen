    "intro": "Dennstaedtia javanica, commonly known as the Javan shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments with a wavy or serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces adventitious roots, which help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are evergreen and can grow up to several feet in length, making it a notable ornamental plant in horticulture."
