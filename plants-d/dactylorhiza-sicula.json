    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pink to purple flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
