It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant is typically found in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of the trunk and helps anchor the plant in moist soil. Dendrosipanea wurdackii plays a role in providing habitat and contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystem."
