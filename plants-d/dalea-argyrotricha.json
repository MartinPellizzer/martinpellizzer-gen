    "intro": "Dalea argyrotricha, commonly known as silver-haired milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, round, grayish-green seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Dalea argyrotricha is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
