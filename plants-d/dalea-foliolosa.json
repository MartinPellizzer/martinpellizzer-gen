    "intro": "Dalea foliolosa, commonly known as the leafy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple pea-like flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Dalea foliolosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species found in rocky soils and open habitats. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience."
