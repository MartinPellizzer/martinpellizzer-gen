    "intro": "Dryopteris polymorpha, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
