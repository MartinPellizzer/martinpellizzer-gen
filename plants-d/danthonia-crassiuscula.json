    "intro": "Danthonia crassiuscula, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often forming dense mats or tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including salt spray and drought. Its ability to thrive in such environments makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
