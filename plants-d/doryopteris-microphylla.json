    "intro": "Doryopteris microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its preference for moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically narrow, with a delicate, lanceolate shape and a matte green surface. It produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often found growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest floors, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
