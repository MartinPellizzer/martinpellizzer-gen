    "intro": "Dendrobium masarangense subsp. theionanthum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of showy, golden-yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms during the dry season, producing fragrant, lance-shaped petals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural collections and indoor gardening."
