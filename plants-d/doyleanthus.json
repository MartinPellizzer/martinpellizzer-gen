    "intro": "Doyleanthus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of orchids. Doyleanthus thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, making it a challenging plant to cultivate. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often protected in its natural habitat."
