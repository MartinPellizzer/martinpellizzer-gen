It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and woodland floors. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Doryopteris alcicornis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
