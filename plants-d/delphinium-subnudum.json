    "intro": "Delphinium subnudum, commonly known as the nakedleaf larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically reduced and often appear as small, scale-like structures along the stem, giving it its common name. This species is part of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy flowers and sometimes toxic compounds. It thrives in alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations."
