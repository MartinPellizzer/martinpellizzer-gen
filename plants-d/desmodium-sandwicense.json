    "intro": "Desmodium sandwicense, commonly known as the Hawaiian velvetbean, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is typically found in wet forest habitats and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of Hawaii. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystem. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside of Hawaii."
