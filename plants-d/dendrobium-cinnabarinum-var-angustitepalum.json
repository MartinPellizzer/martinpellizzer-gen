    "intro": "Dendrobium cinnabarinum var. angustitepalum, commonly known as the narrow-lipped cinnabar orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, orange-red flowers with a distinctive red lip, which are highly sought after in horticulture. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
