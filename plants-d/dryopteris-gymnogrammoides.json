It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The fronds are divided into a series of lance-shaped segments, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers rich, well-drained soil. This species is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its striking foliage and hardy nature."
