    "intro": "Dasystachys senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegalese grass or African grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and savannas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
