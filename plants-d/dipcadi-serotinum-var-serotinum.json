    "intro": "Dipcadi serotinum var. serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering squill, is a bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces a single, upright stem bearing a cluster of pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are basal, strap-like, and often with a waxy coating. The bulb is used in traditional medicine and as a source of ornamental plants due to its striking floral display."
