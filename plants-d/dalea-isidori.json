    "intro": "Dalea isidori, commonly known as the Isidore's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pink to red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in arid environments. Dalea isidori is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
