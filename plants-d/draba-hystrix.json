    "intro": "Draba hystrix, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, dark green leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Draba hystrix is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
