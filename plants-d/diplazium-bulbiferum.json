    "intro": "Diplazium bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbous shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in small, bulbous structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium bulbiferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
