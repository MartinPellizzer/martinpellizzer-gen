    "intro": "Deschampsia paramushirensis, commonly known as the Paramushire grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial grass species that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it survive in harsh environments. Deschampsia paramushirensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
