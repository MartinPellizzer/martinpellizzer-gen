    "intro": "Diploclinium fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered diploclinium, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, three-lobed berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
