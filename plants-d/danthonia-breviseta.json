    "intro": "Danthonia breviseta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and coastal dunes. Due to its resilience and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity."
