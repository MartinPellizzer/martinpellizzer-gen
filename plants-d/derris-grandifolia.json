    "intro": "Derris grandifolia, commonly known as the giant climbing bean, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant is notable for containing rotenone, a toxic compound used in traditional pesticides. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a valuable ornamental and an invasive species in some regions. Derris grandifolia thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in forest understories."
