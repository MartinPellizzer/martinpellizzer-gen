    "intro": "Diplachne fusca var. muelleri, commonly known as Mueller's flat grass, is a variant of the species Diplachne fusca, which is native to Australia. It is a perennial grass characterized by its flat, spreading growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in summer, followed by slender, cylindrical seed heads. This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
