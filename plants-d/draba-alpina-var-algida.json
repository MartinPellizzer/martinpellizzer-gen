    "intro": "Draba alpina var. algida, commonly known as the alpine winter cress, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It thrives in rocky soils and alpine tundra, often surviving harsh winters due to its hardy nature. This variant is distinguished from other Draba species by its specific geographic distribution and morphological traits."
