    "intro": "Dracula antonii, commonly known as the vampire plant, is a rare and striking member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Ecuador and is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, which attract specific pollinators. Dracula antonii is noted for its slow growth and requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a popular but challenging plant among collectors."
