    "intro": "Digitaria ekmanii var. curtissii, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife and its role in wetland restoration projects."
