    "intro": "Dryopteris parasitica var. glabrindusiata, commonly known as the smooth-leafed water fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are typically glabrous, or smooth to the touch. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
