    "intro": "Drosera atra, commonly known as the black rose sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark red to black-colored leaves, which are covered in sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant's leaves also produce a sweet nectar to lure prey, which is then digested by the plant's enzymes. Drosera atra typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires a humid, shady environment. It is a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and fascinating predatory behavior."
