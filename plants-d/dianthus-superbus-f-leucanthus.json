    "intro": "Dianthus superbus f. leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered candytuft, is a botanical variant of the species Dianthus superbus. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy white flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a profusion of flowers that resemble tiny candies, hence its common name. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. This form is distinguished by its pale white petals, which contrast with the more commonly seen pink or red variants of the species."
