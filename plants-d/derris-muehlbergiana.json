    "intro": "Derris muehlbergiana, commonly known as the Muehlberg's derris, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, particularly derrisine, which has been studied for its potential medicinal properties. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic compounds, it requires careful handling and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes."
