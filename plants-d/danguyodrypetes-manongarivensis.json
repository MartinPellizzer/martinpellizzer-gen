    "intro": "Danguyodrypetes manongarivensis, commonly known as the Madagascar velvet tree, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that give it a velvety appearance, adapted to retain moisture in the humid environment. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, this species is critically endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
