    "intro": "Dionysia saponacea, commonly known as soapberry vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by orange to red berries that contain toxic seeds. Dionysia saponacea is notable for its sap, which has a soapy texture and was historically used by indigenous peoples for various purposes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
