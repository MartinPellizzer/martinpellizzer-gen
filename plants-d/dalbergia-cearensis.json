    "intro": "Dalbergia cearensis, commonly known as Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pods. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental and commercial value, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and for reforestation projects."
