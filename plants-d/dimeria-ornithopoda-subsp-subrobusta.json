    "intro": "Dimeria ornithopoda subsp. subrobusta, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its resilience, it is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered an indicator species of dry environments."
