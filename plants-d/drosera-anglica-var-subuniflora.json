    "intro": "Drosera anglica var. subuniflora, commonly known as the English sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It produces small, white flowers arranged in a dense cluster, and its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of dew-like secretions. This variant is distinguished by its reduced number of flowers compared to the typical form of Drosera anglica."
