    "intro": "Diplazium polypodioides, commonly known as the slender sword fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
