    "intro": "Droogmansia angolensis, commonly known as the Angola droogmansia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Angola. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. Droogmansia angolensis is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
