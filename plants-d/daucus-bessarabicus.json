    "intro": "Daucus bessarabicus, commonly known as the Bessarabian carrot, is a flowering plant native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like parsley and dill. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Its roots are typically small and not as commercially valuable as those of the domesticated carrot. Daucus bessarabicus is often found in dry, open habitats and is considered a wild relative of cultivated carrots."
