It is characterized by its unique, flattened fronds that form a rosette-like structure, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to New Zealand, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil. The fronds are typically dark green and can grow quite large, reaching several meters in height. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to add a tropical feel to gardens."
