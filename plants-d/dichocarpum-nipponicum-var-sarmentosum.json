    "intro": "Dichocarpum nipponicum var. sarmentosum, commonly known as Japanese climbing fern, is a variant of the genus Dichocarpum native to East Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of stolons, which allow it to spread along the ground or up supports. The plant features bipinnate leaves that are often divided into numerous small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in spadices, and it produces distinctive, elongated berries. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
