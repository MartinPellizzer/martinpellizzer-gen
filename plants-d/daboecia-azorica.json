    "intro": "Daboecia azorica, commonly known as the Azorean heath, is a flowering plant native to the Azores, an archipelago in the North Atlantic. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant typically forms dense shrubs with small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of pink or white flowers. It thrives in rocky or coastal habitats, often found in open, sunny areas with high exposure to wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
