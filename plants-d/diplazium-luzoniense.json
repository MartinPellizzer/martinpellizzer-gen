    "intro": "Diplazium luzoniense, commonly known as the Luzon shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization."
