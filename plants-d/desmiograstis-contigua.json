    "intro": "Desmiograstis contigua, commonly known as the common bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its unique ability to capture small aquatic organisms using specialized bladder-like structures called vesicles. These vesicles are inflated with air and can trap prey such as water fleas and small crustaceans. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is found in various parts of the world. Its botanical features include small, bilaterally symmetrical flowers and a root system adapted for aquatic environments."
