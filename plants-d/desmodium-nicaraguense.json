    "intro": "Desmodium nicaraguense, commonly known as the Nicaraguan burr legume, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that enclose its seeds, which are often dispersed by animals or through mechanical means. Native to Central America, it thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with well-drained soil. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
