    "intro": "Diplazium lobbianum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
