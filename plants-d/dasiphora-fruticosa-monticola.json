    "intro": "Dasiphora fruticosa monticola, commonly known as the mountain poppy, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in arid conditions. The mountain poppy is an important component of high-elevation ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small wildlife."
