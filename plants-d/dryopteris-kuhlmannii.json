    "intro": "Dryopteris kuhlmannii, commonly known as the Kuhlmann's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly China and Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant forms compact clumps and has a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread slowly over time. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded gardens due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature."
