    "intro": "Diplomorpha hanalei, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a rare endemic plant native to the volcanic slopes of Haleakal\u0101 in Maui, Hawaii. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette of silver-green, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem that bears yellow-orange flower heads, which bloom once in its lifetime. Diplomorpha hanalei is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment with limited nutrients and intense sunlight. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from invasive species, it is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts critical for its survival."
