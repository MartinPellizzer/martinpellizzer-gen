    "intro": "Deschampsia flexuosa var. legei, commonly known as the bentgrass or nodding hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America. It features fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bend toward the ground, a characteristic that lends it its common name. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along stream banks. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
