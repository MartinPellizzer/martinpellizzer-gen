    "intro": "Daiswa hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan daisy, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hainan in China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. The plant is characterized by its showy, white to pale yellow flower heads that resemble daisies, with narrow, linear leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, often found in open forest areas or grasslands. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in cultivation outside its native habitat."
