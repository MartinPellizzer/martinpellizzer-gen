    "intro": "Dichondra micrantha, commonly known as small-flowered dichondra, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white or pale blue flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in the spring. Dichondra micrantha thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense mats."
