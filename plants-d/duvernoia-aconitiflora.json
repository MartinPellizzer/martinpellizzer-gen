    "intro": "Duvernoia aconitiflora, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen tree native to China. It is characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and conical shape, which provide year-round aesthetic value. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, followed by red berries that attract birds. It is well-suited for shaded environments and has moderate water requirements. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
