    "intro": "Danthonia pauciflora var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine danthonia, is a low-growing grass species native to mountainous regions. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are usually pale green to reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing alpine soils."
