    "intro": "Dendrobium ustulatum, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, wiry stems that can reach up to 2 meters in length. Its flowers are striking, with bright orange or red petals and a distinctive yellow lip. Dendrobium ustulatum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its vibrant, showy blooms."
