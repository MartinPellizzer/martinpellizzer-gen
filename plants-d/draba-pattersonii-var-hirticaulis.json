    "intro": "Draba pattersonii var. hirticaulis, commonly known as the hairy stalked whitlow grass, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of western North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is considered rare and is often found in specific habitats such as talus slopes and meadows."
