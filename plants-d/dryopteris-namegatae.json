    "intro": "Dryopteris namegatae, commonly known as the Japanese Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow in the dark, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators."
