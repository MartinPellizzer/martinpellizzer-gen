    "intro": "Desmodium scalpe, commonly known as the hairy beggar's tick, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its pods are typically hairy and linear. Desmodium scalpe is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
