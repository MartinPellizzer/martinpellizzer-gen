    "intro": "Digitaria sienitica, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to drought conditions and is often used for erosion control due to its dense root system. Digitaria sienitica is also an important forage plant for livestock in certain regions."
