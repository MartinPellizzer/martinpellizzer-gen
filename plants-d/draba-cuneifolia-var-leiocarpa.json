It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pungent scent. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. This variant is distinguished by its smooth, hairless leaves compared to other forms of Draba cuneifolia."
