    "intro": "Descurainia incana subsp. viscosa, commonly known as sticky hoary vetch, is a herbaceous annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and slender, branching stems that often have a sticky coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by slender, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in dry fields, roadsides, and wastelands. Its adaptations to harsh environments include drought tolerance and rapid growth cycles."
