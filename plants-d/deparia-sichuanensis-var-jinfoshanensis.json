    "intro": "Deparia sichuanensis var. jinfoshanensis, commonly known as the Jinfoshan water fern, is a rare variant of the water fern genus Deparia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a short, creeping rhizome and small, clustered sporangia. It is native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan Province in China, where it thrives in cool, shaded streams and pools. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
