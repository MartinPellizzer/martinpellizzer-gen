It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands. Dicliptera spicata is valued in some regions for its use in livestock forage and soil stabilization."
