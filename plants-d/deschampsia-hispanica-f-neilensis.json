    "intro": "Deschampsia hispanica f. neilensis, commonly known as the Neil's bentgrass, is a variant of the bentgrass genus native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing, perennial grass characterized by its fine, silver-green blades and tufted growth habit. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas and along stream banks. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
