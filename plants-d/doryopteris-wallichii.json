    "intro": "Doryopteris wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high elevations. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a complex structure that aids in photosynthesis in low-light conditions. Doryopteris wallichii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
