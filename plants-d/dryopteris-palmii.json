    "intro": "Dryopteris palmii, commonly known as the palm fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pinnately compound fronds that resemble the leaves of a palm tree, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in humid conditions."
