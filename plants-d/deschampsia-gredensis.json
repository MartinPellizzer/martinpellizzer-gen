    "intro": "Deschampsia gredensis, commonly known as Gredens' feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage. The plant produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Deschampsia gredensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil."
