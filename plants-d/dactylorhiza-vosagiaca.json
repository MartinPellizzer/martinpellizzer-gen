    "intro": "Dactylorhiza vosagiaca, commonly known as the Vosagian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers with three sepals and three petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or heathland habitats. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
