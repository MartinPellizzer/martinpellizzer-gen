It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that give it a glass-like appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Diaphyllum species are known for their small, clustered flowers that can range in color from white to pale pink. Its unique foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse cultivation."
