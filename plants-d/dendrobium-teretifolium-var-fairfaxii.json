    "intro": "Dendrobium teretifolium var. fairfaxii, commonly known as the Fairfax's bamboo orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant features slender, bamboo-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded conditions. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces fragrant, spike-like inflorescences with small, colorful flowers. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience in suitable conditions."
