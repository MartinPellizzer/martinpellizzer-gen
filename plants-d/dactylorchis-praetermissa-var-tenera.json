It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. The plant features a short rhizome with a single, erect stem that bears several lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, white or pale green, and are arranged in a loose raceme. This orchid is notable for its delicate appearance and is often overlooked due to its inconspicuous size."
