    "intro": "Dictyocaryum, commonly known as the \"skeleton fern,\" is a genus of ferns characterized by its unique, delicate fronds. The plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are typically narrow and have a feathery appearance, with a distinctive, segmented structure. Dictyocaryum species often grow in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
