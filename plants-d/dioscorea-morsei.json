    "intro": "Dioscorea morsei, commonly known as the Morsei yam, is a species of tuberous plant belonging to the family Dioscoreaceae. It is native to tropical Africa, particularly found in countries such as Cameroon and Nigeria. The plant produces a large, starchy tuber that is used as a food source in local communities. Its growth habit involves a climbing vine with palmately lobed leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The tuber is often harvested after a growing season of several months, and it has been traditionally used in both culinary and medicinal applications."
