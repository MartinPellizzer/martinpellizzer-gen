    "intro": "Didymeles excelsa, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that helps it remain buoyant in water. Its flowers are white and fragrant, blooming at night and attracting pollinators such as beetles. Didymeles excelsa plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water bodies."
