    "intro": "Davallia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean shield fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself to tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproduction in the wild."
