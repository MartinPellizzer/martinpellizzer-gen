It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, tropical environments. Its foliage consists of long, narrow, evergreen leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
