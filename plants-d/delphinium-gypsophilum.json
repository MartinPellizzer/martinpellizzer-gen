    "intro": "Delphinium gypsophilum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of vivid blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
