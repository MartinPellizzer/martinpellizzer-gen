    "intro": "Digitaria magna, commonly known as giant digitaria, is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows up to 2 meters in height, with long, narrow leaves and spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a useful forage crop and a potential weed. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in suitable habitats."
