    "intro": "Dryopteris tenebrosa, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are often tinged with purple or black, giving it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps over time. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
