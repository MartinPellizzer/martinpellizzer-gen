    "intro": "Diospyros toxicaria, commonly known as the poison ebony, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, yellowish pulp. Its bark and leaves contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and traditional uses in certain cultures."
