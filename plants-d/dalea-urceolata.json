    "intro": "Dalea urceolata, commonly known as the cupleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and desert scrub. The plant is characterized by its distinctive cup-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Dalea urceolata is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological importance in arid environments."
