    "intro": "Drosera menziesii, commonly known as the Menzies' Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of western North America. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and fens. Its flowers are small, pinkish-red, and clustered in a spike, producing nectar to attract pollinators. Drosera menziesii is a perennial species that thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in regions with high rainfall."
