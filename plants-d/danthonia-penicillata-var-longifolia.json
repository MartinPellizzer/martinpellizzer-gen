    "intro": "Danthonia penicillata var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, slender blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on moist soils. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along stream banks, where it thrives in consistently damp conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow spike with small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
