    "intro": "Dactylis interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted brome, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
