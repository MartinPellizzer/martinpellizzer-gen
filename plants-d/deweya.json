    "intro": "Deweya, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Deweya is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soils. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it an important plant in ecological gardens."
