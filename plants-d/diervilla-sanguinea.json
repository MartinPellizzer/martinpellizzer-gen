    "intro": "Diervilla sanguinea, commonly known as redbeard honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright red bracts that appear in late summer. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are oval-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall. Diervilla sanguinea is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
