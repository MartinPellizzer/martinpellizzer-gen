    "intro": "Dactylorhiza incarnata var. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces tall, erect stems with whorled leaves and spikes of pink or purple flowers that bloom later in the season compared to other Dactylorhiza species. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged soil. This orchid is considered a specialist species, often indicating the presence of nutrient-poor, acidic conditions in its environment."
