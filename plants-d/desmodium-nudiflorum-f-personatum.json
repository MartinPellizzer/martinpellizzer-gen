It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in disturbed areas and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both ecological and ethnobotanical studies."
