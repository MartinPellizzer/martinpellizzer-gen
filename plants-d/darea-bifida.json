    "intro": "Darea bifida, commonly known as the splitleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are deeply lobed or split, giving it its common name. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairy stem that rises from the center of the rosette. Its flowers are yellow and form a single bloom at the top of the stem, followed by a distinctive crown of bracts that resemble a clock. Darea bifida is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
