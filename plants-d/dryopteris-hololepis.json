    "intro": "Dryopteris hololepis, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features broad, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in kidney-shaped groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
