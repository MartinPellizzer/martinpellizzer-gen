It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruits are woody, fleshy capsules that split open to release seeds. Dillenia membranifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
