    "intro": "Dryopteris protensa, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, shield-like shape, with a central, upright fertile frond surrounded by sterile, fan-shaped fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky areas. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the late summer months."
