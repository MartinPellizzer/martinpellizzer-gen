    "intro": "Dryas punctata subsp. alaskensis, commonly known as the Alaska mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white to greyish hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in a cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows. Due to its hardy nature and adaptability to harsh climates, it is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
