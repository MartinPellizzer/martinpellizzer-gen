    "intro": "Desmodium fallax var. dilatatum, commonly known as the broadleaf desmodium, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with broad, heart-shaped leaflets and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas due to its adaptability. The species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration and soil enrichment."
