    "intro": "Dracula robledorum, commonly known as the \"Dragon's Blood\" orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers, which are often described as resembling a dragon's blood. The plant has thick, fleshy roots that help it absorb moisture from the humid air. It blooms once every few years, making it a highly sought-after specimen among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
