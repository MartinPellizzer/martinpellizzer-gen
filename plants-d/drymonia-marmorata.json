    "intro": "Drymonia marmorata, commonly known as the marble fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have a marbled pattern of light and dark green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, nutrient-rich soil. Drymonia marmorata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
