    "intro": "Dischidia roseoflavida, commonly known as the pink-flowered air plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions of Malaysia and Indonesia. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to climb using aerial roots. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its showy, pinkish-red flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the warmer months, attracting various pollinators."
