    "intro": "Dryopteris rustica, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. While it does not produce flowers, it plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
