    "intro": "Digitaria virens subsp. pectinata, commonly known as the hairy Digitaria, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its adaptability, it can be both a weed and a forage species in various ecosystems."
