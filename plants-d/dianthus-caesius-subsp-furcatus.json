    "intro": "Dianthus caesius subsp. furcatus, commonly known as the purple campion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its clustered, showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the stems are usually erect and branching. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure compared to the main species, with more elongated petals."
