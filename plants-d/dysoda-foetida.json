    "intro": "Dysoda foetida, commonly known as the stinking nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 30-60 centimeters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are ovate with a rough texture. Dysoda foetida is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is more pronounced in its flowers. It is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can be a weed in agricultural areas."
