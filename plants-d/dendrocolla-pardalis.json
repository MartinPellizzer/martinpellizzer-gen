    "intro": "Dendrocolla pardalis, commonly known as the golden lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal components. Its coloration, often golden or yellowish, results from the photosynthetic activity of the algal partner. Dendrocolla pardalis plays an important ecological role by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
