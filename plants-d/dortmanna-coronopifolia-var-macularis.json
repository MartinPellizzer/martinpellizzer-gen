    "intro": "Dortmanna coronopifolia var. macularis, commonly known as the spotted liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features elongated, leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are often spotted or streaked with dark pigmentation. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are borne on the upper surfaces of the leaves and are used for sexual reproduction. This variety is notable for its distinctive appearance and ecological role in nutrient cycling within its habitat."
