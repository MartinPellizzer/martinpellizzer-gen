    "intro": "Digitaria sanguinalis var. timorensis, commonly known as Timor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
