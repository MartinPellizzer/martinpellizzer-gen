    "intro": "Dryopteris filipaleata, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It features a dense, upright growth habit with deeply divided, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in clusters called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage. This fern is relatively low-maintenance and can tolerate a range of soil conditions once established."
