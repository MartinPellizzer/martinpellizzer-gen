    "intro": "Drosera macrantha subsp. planchonii, commonly known as the Cape York Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with small, white flowers. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as swamps and heathlands. Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils."
