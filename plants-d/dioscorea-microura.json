    "intro": "Dioscorea microura, commonly known as the small-leaf yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are used as a food source in some cultures. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into capsule fruits. Its growth habit involves twining around supports, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The tuberous roots are often harvested for their starchy content, though they may require processing to remove toxins."
