    "intro": "Dryopteris assamensis, commonly known as the Assam wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. The plant's rhizomes are thick and wiry, contributing to its ability to form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
