    "intro": "Dictyogramme manniana, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, frond-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. The fronds are typically divided into numerous pinnae, which increase surface area for photosynthesis and gas exchange."
