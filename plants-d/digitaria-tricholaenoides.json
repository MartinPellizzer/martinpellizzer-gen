    "intro": "Digitaria tricholaenoides, commonly known as slender digitgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open fields, grasslands, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a clump-forming habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle structure. It produces small, two-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Digitaria tricholaenoides is often found in agricultural areas and can be a weed in cultivated fields."
