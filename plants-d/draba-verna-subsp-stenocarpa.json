    "intro": "Draba verna subsp. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-carpel whitlow grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of linear leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils in alpine and arctic environments. It is native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, where it is adapted to cold climates. Due to its compact size and early flowering, it is often found in mountainous areas during the early spring."
