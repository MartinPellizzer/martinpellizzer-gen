    "intro": "Doona oblonga, commonly known as the broadleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a taproot system and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its leaves are hairy and have a distinctive bitter taste, while its flowers produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. Doona oblonga is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
