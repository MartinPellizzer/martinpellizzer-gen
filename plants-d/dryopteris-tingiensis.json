    "intro": "Dryopteris tingiensis, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori that are closely clustered on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris tingiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
