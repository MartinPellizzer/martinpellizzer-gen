    "intro": "Dendrophthora pendula, commonly known as the weeping ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping inflorescences that give it its common name, and its striking, ghostly white flowers with intricate patterns. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
