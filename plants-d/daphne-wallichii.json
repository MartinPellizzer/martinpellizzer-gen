    "intro": "Daphne wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features elegant, fragrant flowers that range from white to pink, often with a distinctive yellow center. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its showy blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring careful handling."
