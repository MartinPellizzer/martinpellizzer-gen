    "intro": "Dugesia, commonly known as a type of flatworm, is a genus of free-living turbellarians belonging to the family Dugesiidae. These organisms are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Dugesia species are characterized by their elongated, dorsoventrally flattened bodies and a simple digestive system. They lack a circulatory system but have a muscular pharynx used for feeding on small organisms. Their reproductive system includes both male and female reproductive organs, allowing for hermaphroditism in many species."
