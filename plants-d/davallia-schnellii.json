    "intro": "Davallia schnellii, commonly known as the silver-velvet fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures. The plant's unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts."
