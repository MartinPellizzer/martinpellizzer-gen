    "intro": "Davallia dareiformis, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green to golden in color. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizomes are wiry and can spread to form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds."
