    "intro": "Didymoglossum hedwigii, commonly known as the Hedwig's moss, is a small, leafy liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its closely spaced, ovate leaves that are often arranged in two rows, giving it a dense, carpet-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as archegonia, are located on the leaf surfaces, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Didymoglossum hedwigii is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for undisturbed, humid habitats."
