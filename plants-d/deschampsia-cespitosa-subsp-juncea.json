    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa subsp. juncea, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, blue-gray florets. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and streambanks, and is often found in wet meadows. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and makes it a valuable plant for wetland restoration."
