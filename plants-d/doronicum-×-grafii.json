    "intro": "Doronicum \u00d7 grafii, commonly known as the hybrid leopard's bane, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its striking, daisy-like flowers that range from yellow to orange in color. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its early spring blooming habit, which adds color to gardens before many other flowers appear."
