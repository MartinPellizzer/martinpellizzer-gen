It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in agricultural areas."
