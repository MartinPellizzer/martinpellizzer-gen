    "intro": "Diostea juncea, commonly known as the narrow-leafed diostea, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Diostea juncea thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is occasionally cultivated for its ornamental value due to its delicate appearance and resilience in harsh conditions."
