    "intro": "Dichanthelium acuminatum var. septentrionale, commonly known as the northern spikegrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spike-like inflorescences with small, spikelet-bearing branches. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is characterized by its ability to thrive in saturated soils. This variant is often confused with other Dichanthelium species due to its similar morphology but can be distinguished by its geographic distribution and habitat preferences."
