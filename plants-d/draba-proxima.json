    "intro": "Draba proxima, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Draba proxima typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in meadows and scree slopes. Its low-growing habit and ability to withstand cold temperatures make it well adapted to high-altitude habitats."
