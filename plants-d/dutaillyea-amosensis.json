    "intro": "Dutaillyea amosensis, commonly known as the Amos's flaxflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like blooms. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dutaillyea amosensis is considered a vulnerable species."
