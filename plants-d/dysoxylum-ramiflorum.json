It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elongated, narrow leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in panicle-like inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
