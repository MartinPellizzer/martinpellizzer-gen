    "intro": "Dupatya rigidula, commonly known as the rigid dwarf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a dense, crust-like thallus with a dark green to blackish upper surface and a lighter, granular lower surface. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to absorb nutrients from the substrate. It is typically found on rocks, tree bark, and soil in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health."
