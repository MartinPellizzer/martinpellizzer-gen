    "intro": "Davallia deparioides, commonly known as the silver-veined fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with silvery veins that contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to humid indoor spaces."
