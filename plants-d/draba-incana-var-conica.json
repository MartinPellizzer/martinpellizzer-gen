    "intro": "Draba incana var. conica, commonly known as the narrowleaf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a compact rosette of narrow, glaucous leaves that are typically covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Draba incana var. conica is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a wildflower in suitable climates."
