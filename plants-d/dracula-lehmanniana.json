    "intro": "Dracula lehmanniana, commonly known as the Lehmann's Dracula, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its intricate, velvety petals that resemble the flowing robes of a medieval noble, giving it its dramatic common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in the cool, humid conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Its flowers are usually a deep purple or red, with intricate patterns that add to its visual appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
