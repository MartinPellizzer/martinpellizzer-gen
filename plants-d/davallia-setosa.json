    "intro": "Davallia setosa, commonly known as the silver-veined fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with silvery veins, giving it a striking appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing structures called sorus. Davallia setosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in suitable conditions."
