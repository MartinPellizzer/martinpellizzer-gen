It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits that turn red when mature. This species is also notable for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of timber in its native region."
