    "intro": "Dryopteris bartlettii, commonly known as Bartlett's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, elegant appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
