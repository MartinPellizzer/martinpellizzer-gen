    "intro": "Dracophyllum urvilleanum var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain dracophyllum, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and other ericaceous plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. It produces clusters of pink or white flowers in the spring, which are attractive to pollinators. This variant is particularly valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor, rocky soils."
