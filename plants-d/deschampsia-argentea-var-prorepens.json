    "intro": "Deschampsia argentea var. prorepens, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to northern regions of North America. It features narrow, silver-tipped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance, and it often forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground. The plant produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
