    "intro": "Diplogon oregonum, commonly known as Oregon's ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale green, bloom in early spring and are often overlooked due to their delicate and inconspicuous appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Diplogon oregonum is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health."
