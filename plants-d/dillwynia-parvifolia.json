    "intro": "Dillwynia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved dillwynia, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod-like fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. It produces small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
