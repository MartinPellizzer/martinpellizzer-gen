    "intro": "Deschampsia ovata var. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. This variant thrives in cold, moist environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in harsh mountainous conditions. The plant is adapted to low temperatures and can survive in areas with limited nutrient availability."
