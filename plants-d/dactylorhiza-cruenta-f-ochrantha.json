    "intro": "Dactylorhiza cruenta f. ochrantha, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires a humid environment for optimal growth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor the plant in wet, boggy conditions. This orchid is often found in association with other wetland plants and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
