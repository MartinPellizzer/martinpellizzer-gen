    "intro": "Decodon aquaticus, commonly known as the water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow water. Decodon aquaticus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
