    "intro": "Discocalyx montana, commonly known as the mountain disc lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments. It features a dark green to blackish upper surface with a distinctive white or pale colored lower layer. The thallus is composed of a complex interwoven network of fungal hyphae and algal cells. It is often found on tree trunks, rocks, and soil in temperate and subalpine regions. This lichen plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality."
