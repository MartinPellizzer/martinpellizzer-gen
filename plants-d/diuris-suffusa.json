    "intro": "Diuris suffusa, commonly known as the crimson spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It features a compact, hairy rhizome and produces a single, slender spike bearing several small, spider-like flowers. The flowers are typically pink to red in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that is often darker than the rest of the flower. It blooms during the late winter to early spring, relying on specific pollinators such as thynnid wasps. The plant is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
