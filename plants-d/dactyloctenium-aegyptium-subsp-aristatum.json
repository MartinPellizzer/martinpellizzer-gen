    "intro": "Dactyloctenium aegyptium subsp. aristatum, commonly known as the Egyptian dactyloctenium, is a grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, white to pale blue flowers. It is adapted to grow in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. This subspecies is often considered a weed but has some ornamental value due to its delicate appearance."
