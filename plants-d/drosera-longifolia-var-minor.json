    "intro": "Drosera longifolia var. minor, commonly known as the lesser sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its small white flowers are borne on slender stalks and bloom during the spring and summer months. This variant is smaller than the typical Drosera longifolia, with shorter stems and smaller leaves."
