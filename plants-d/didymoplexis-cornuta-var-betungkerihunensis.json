    "intro": "Didymoplexis cornuta var. betungkerihunensis, commonly known as the Betung Kerihun climbing orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the lowland rainforests of West Kalimantan, Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and pendulous, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy, where it thrives in high humidity and dappled sunlight. Its flowers, which bloom in clusters, are predominantly yellow with a greenish tint, making it a visually distinctive species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
