    "intro": "Dendrobium papiliolabratum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling small suns. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients to help it survive in its natural habitat. Dendrobium papiliolabratum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
