It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring two distinct petals that are often brightly colored to attract pollinators. The leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Dialypetalum species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia. These plants are often grown for their ornamental value due to their showy flowers and adaptability to various soil conditions."
