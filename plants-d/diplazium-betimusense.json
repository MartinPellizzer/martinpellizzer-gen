    "intro": "Diplazium betimusense, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, pointed segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Diplazium betimusense plays a significant role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity."
