    "intro": "Dickasonia vernicosa, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine, silky hairs that give it a distinctive, almost velvety appearance. The plant forms a low-growing, clump-forming rosette with narrow, lance-shaped fronds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
