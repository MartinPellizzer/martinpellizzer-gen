    "intro": "Digitalis lanata subsp. leucophaea, commonly known as the white-flowered foxglove, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear tubular, pale to white flowers arranged in a raceme. The leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture and are arranged alternately along the stem. This subspecies is closely related to other Digitalis species and shares similar medicinal properties due to its cardiac glycosides. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
