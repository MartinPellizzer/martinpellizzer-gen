    "intro": "Dryopteris rubristipes, commonly known as the red-stemmed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that often display a reddish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris rubristipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
