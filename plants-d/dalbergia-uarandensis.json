It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, ovate leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid, well-drained soils."
