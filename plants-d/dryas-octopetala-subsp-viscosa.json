    "intro": "Dryas octopetala subsp. viscosa, commonly known as the sticky dryas, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, often sticky leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its subspecies viscosa is distinguished by the presence of a sticky substance on the leaves, which may deter herbivores. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil in harsh, high-altitude ecosystems."
