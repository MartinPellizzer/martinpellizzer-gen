    "intro": "Dasiphora unifoliolata, commonly known as the single leaf fireweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. Its fibrous root system makes it drought-tolerant and adaptable to various environmental conditions."
