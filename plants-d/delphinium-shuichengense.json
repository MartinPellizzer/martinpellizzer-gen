    "intro": "Delphinium shuichengense, commonly known as the Shuicheng larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear showy, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. Delphinium shuichengense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display. However, like many larkspurs, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
