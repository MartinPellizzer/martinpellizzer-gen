    "intro": "Donacodes minor, commonly known as the lesser donkey's ear, is a small, delicate fern native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous areas. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces small, clustered fronds with a distinctive, ear-like shape. Its spores are released from tiny, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Donacodes minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
