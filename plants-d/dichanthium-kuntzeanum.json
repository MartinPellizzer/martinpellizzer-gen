It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in open grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in dry to semi-arid conditions. Dichanthium kuntzeanum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitats."
