    "intro": "Disciphania inversa, commonly known as the inverted disc lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which consists of a crustose, foliose, and squamulose growth form. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is typically found on rock surfaces, soil, or bark in temperate and tropical regions. Disciphania inversa is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to air pollution and environmental changes."
