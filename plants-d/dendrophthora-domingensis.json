    "intro": "Dendrophthora domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean. It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the rainforests of the Dominican Republic. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
