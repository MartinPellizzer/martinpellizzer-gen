It typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs, fens, and marshes. The plant features a tall, erect stem with few leaves and produces clusters of violet or pinkish-purple flowers. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. The species is notable for its delicate appearance and ecological significance in wetland ecosystems."
