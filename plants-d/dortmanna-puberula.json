    "intro": "Dortmanna puberula, commonly known as the hairy dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. The plant has a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft pubescence. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are borne in dense, terminal clusters and bloom from June to August. Dortmanna puberula is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
