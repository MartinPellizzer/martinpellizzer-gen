    "intro": "Dischidia melanesica, commonly known as the Melanesian fig. It is a climbing or trailing vine native to tropical regions of the Pacific, including parts of Australia and New Guinea. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly pubescence. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically clustered in umbels, and it produces edible, fig-like fruits that are yellow when ripe. Dischidia melanesica is often grown as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and ability to trail or climb in indoor and outdoor settings."
