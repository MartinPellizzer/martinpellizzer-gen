    "intro": "Dalea tephrosioides, commonly known as the yellow prairie clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow to reddish-pink flowers. The plant has compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, legume-like pods that contain seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. Dalea tephrosioides plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it ecologically valuable in soil enrichment."
