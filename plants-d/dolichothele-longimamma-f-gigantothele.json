    "intro": "Dolichothele longimamma f. gigantothele, commonly known as the giant spider orchid, is a unique member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) native to Australia. This plant is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
