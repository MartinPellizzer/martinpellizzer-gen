    "intro": "Drymophloeus propinquus var. keiensis, commonly known as the Kei River ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the eastern regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark that provides a rugged appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody, cylindrical fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverine forests and rocky outcrops. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
