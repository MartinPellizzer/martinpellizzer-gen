It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Deschampsia podophora plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
