    "intro": "Daphne linifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features finely textured, silvery-white leaves that provide a striking visual contrast to its clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, Daphne linifolia is often cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
