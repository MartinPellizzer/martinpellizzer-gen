    "intro": "Draba nichanaica, commonly known as the Karakoram scurvy grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and delicate leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cold, arid conditions. Its yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it is often found in meadows and scree slopes at elevations above 3,000 meters. Draba nichanaica is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing nectar for pollinators."
