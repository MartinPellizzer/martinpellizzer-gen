    "intro": "Deparia macraei, commonly known as the Macraei water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. Its reproductive structures are spore-producing, typical of ferns, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms. The plant's botanical features make it an important indicator of water quality in its native habitats."
