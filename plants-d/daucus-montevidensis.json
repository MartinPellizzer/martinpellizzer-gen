    "intro": "Daucus montevidensis, commonly known as the Uruguay carrot, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Argentina. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels. Its roots are typically thin and not as fleshy as those of the common carrot. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid conditions."
