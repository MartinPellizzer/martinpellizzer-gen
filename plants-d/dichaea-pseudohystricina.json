    "intro": "Dichaea pseudohystricina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the canopy. Its unique appearance and rarity make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Due to habitat destruction, it is classified as endangered in many regions."
