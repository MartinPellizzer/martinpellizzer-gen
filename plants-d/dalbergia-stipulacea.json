It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is valued for its dense, dark wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species."
