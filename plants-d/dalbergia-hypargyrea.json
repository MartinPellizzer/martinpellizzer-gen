    "intro": "Dalbergia hypargyrea, commonly known as the silverwood tree, is a species of legume native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched trunk and its distinctive silver-gray bark. The leaves are bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that give the plant a feathery appearance. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, arranged in dense, terminal spikes, while the fruit is a legume pod containing several seeds. This tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in dry, sandy soils."
