    "intro": "Diplazium coarctatum, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, narrow shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae. Diplazium coarctatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, lush ground covers."
