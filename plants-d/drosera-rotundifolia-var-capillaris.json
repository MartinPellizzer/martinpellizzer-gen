    "intro": "Drosera rotundifolia var. capillaris, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to moist, acidic environments in northern regions. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically shorter and more slender compared to the standard variety, giving it a distinct appearance. It plays an important ecological role in nutrient-poor habitats by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
