    "intro": "Dalbergia obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are typically ovate or obovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Dalbergia obovata is often found in savannah woodlands and is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
