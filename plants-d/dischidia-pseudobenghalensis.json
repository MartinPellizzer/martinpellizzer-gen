    "intro": "Dischidia pseudobenghalensis, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ancistrocladaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and aerial roots that help it cling to surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated as a houseplant in many regions."
