    "intro": "Digitaria phaeotricha, commonly known as hairy digit grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is both a common weed and a valuable forage plant in certain ecosystems."
