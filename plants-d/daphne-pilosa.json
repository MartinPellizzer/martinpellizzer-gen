    "intro": "Daphne pilosa, commonly known as the hairy daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, aromatic foliage with a hairy texture, and its flowers are typically pink or white, appearing in early spring. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable addition to gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant blooms and distinctive foliage."
