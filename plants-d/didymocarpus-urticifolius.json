    "intro": "Didymocarpus urticifolius, commonly known as the stinging nettle tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stinging hairs on the leaves and stems, similar to those found in true nettles. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruits are three-winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
