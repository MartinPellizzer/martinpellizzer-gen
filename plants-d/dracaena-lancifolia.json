    "intro": "Dracaena lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dracaena, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by red berries, though it is more valued for its ornamental foliage than its flowering. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena lancifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance requirements."
