    "intro": "Doryopteris ornithopus var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf feather fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features finely divided, bright green fronds that resemble bird feathers, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread slowly across the ground. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in shady garden settings."
