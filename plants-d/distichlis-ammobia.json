    "intro": "Distichlis ammobia, commonly known as the saltbush or salt marsh grass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is a perennial grass that thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. Distichlis ammobia is also valued for its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding."
