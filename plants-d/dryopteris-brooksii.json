    "intro": "Dryopteris brooksii, commonly known as the Brooks' wood fern, is a deciduous fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features a robust rhizome system that supports its growth in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, arching shape that adds ornamental value to gardens. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus. This plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and is often found in forest understories."
