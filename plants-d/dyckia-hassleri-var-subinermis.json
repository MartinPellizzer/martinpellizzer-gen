    "intro": "Dyckia hassleri var. subinermis, commonly known as the silver dyckia, is a compact, evergreen bromeliad native to South America. It features rosettes of narrow, silver-gray leaves with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red or orange. It is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
