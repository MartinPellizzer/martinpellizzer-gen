    "intro": "Digitaria eggersii, commonly known as the Eggers' digitaria, is a grass species native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f (tufted) growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
