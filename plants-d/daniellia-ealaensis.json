    "intro": "Daniellia ealaensis, commonly known as the Ealaensis Daniellia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Ghana and Nigeria. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
