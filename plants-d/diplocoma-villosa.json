    "intro": "Diplocoma villosa, commonly known as the hairy diplocoma, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its native high-altitude environment. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Diplocoma villosa is often found in rocky or alpine habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
