    "intro": "Davilla castaneifolia, commonly known as the wax tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, woody fruits that split open to release its seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which gives the plant its common name. Davilla castaneifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
