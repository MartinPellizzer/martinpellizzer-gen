    "intro": "Deschampsia flexuosa var. contracta, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to North America. It features fine, tufted blades that are typically less than 10 cm in height, with a dense, carpet-like growth habit. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wet meadows. Its compact form and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of many ecological communities."
