    "intro": "Dryopteris austriaca var. concordiana, commonly known as the Austrian wood fern, is a variant of the European wood fern. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its fertile fronds that bear spores on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are divided into a complex, lace-like pattern, and it produces both sterile and fertile spore-bearing leaves. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
