    "intro": "Dalbergia adamii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its fine grain and workability. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate, making it a common species in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its economic value, Dalbergia adamii is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
