    "intro": "Dactylanthus taylorii, commonly known as the Christmas flower, is a rare and unique plant native to New Zealand. It is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces a single, fleshy, red or purple flower that opens only at night. Its flowering period occurs between August and December, coinciding with the southern hemisphere's winter. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered critically endangered."
