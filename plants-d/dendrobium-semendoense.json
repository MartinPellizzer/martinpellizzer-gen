    "intro": "Dendrobium semendoense, commonly known as the Semendoense orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems with clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern. Dendrobium semendoense is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
