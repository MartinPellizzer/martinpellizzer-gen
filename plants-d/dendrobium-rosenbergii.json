    "intro": "Dendrobium rosenbergii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of fragrant, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought. Dendrobium rosenbergii is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking, long-lasting blooms."
