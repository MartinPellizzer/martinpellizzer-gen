    "intro": "Dianthus pineticola var. jacupicensis, commonly known as the Sierra cushion campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers with five petals, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. Its foliage consists of dense, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. This variety is notable for its horticultural value and ability to adapt to high-altitude ecosystems."
