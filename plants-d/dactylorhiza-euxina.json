    "intro": "Dactylorhiza euxina, commonly known as the Bulgarian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or heathland habitats. Dactylorhiza euxina is a protected species in many regions due to its ecological significance and declining populations."
