    "intro": "Delphinium xanthanthum, commonly known as the yellow larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of showy, yellow to orange flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many other showy and sometimes toxic plants. Delphinium xanthanthum is often cultivated for its striking floral display, though it contains toxic alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock and humans."
