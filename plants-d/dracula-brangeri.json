    "intro": "Dracula brangeri, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia and Ecuador. It is characterized by its long, slender roots that cling to the bark of trees, and its unique, ghostly white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant lacks leaves and relies entirely on photosynthesis through its roots, which are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Dracula brangeri is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is highly sought after for its beauty and rarity in horticulture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
