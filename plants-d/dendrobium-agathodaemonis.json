    "intro": "Dendrobium agathodaemonis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in mountainous areas. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a highly sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is also considered endangered in its native range."
