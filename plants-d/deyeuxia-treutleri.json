    "intro": "Deyeuxia treutleri, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense stands that help stabilize shoreline areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. Deyeuxia treutleri plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
