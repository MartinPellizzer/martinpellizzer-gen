    "intro": "Deguelia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved deguelia, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a slender pod that splits open to release seeds covered in a tuft of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Deguelia microphylla is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
