    "intro": "Dichapetalum moralesii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico and Central America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant features long, slender stems and produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List."
