    "intro": "Dalechampia scandens var. pseudoclematis, commonly known as the false clematis, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
