    "intro": "Derris rubrocalyx subsp. rubrocalyx, commonly known as the red calyx derris, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red calyces that encase its small, white flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a glossy green surface. The species is valued for its alkaloid content, particularly rotenone, which has been used in traditional medicine and as a natural pesticide."
