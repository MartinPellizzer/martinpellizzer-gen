It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to brown flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
