It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green to brownish-green foliage. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a distinctive costa that extends beyond the mid-leaf. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on soil or rock surfaces in tropical and subtropical regions.
