    "intro": "Drosera calycina var. minor, commonly known as the Lesser Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its flowers are small and usually pink or white, arranged in a dense inflorescence. This variety is less common than the standard Drosera calycina and is prized by carnivorous plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and growth habits."
