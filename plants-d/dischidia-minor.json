    "intro": "Dischidia minor, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical vine belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid environments. Dischidia minor is valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded areas and its ornamental foliage."
