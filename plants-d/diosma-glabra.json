It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It features slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Diosma glabra is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
