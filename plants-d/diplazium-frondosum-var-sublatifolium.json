    "intro": "Diplazium frondosum var. sublatifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, delicate fronds that are typically broader than those of the typical variety. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, feathery appearance. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
