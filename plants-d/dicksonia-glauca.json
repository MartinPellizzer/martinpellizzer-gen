    "intro": "Dicksonia glauca, commonly known as the silver tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a dense, fibrous layer of old fronds. The plant produces a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in height. Its fronds are typically a deep green with a silvery-blue underside, giving it its common name. Dicksonia glauca thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in native forests."
