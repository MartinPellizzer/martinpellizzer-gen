It consists of about 40 species, predominantly found in southern Africa, with some species extending into tropical Asia. The plants are typically herbaceous, with simple, alternate leaves and showy, yellow or orange flowers that resemble buttercups. They often grow in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their attractive foliage and flowers."
