    "intro": "Dysophylla helferi, commonly known as the Helfer's sea holly, is a rare and specialized marine plant belonging to the family Cystophoraceae. It is characterized by its unique, cup-like structures that house its reproductive organs, which are adapted for underwater pollination. The plant thrives in shallow, coastal waters with high salinity and is often found in rocky substrates. Its morphology includes a short, fleshy stem and specialized leaves that aid in buoyancy and nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Dysophylla helferi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
