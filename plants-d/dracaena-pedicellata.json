    "intro": "Dracaena pedicellata, commonly known as the fragrant dracaena, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white streaks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Dracaena pedicellata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
