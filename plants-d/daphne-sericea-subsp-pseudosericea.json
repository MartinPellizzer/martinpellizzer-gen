    "intro": "Daphne sericea subsp. pseudosericea, commonly known as the silverleaf daphne, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring careful handling and placement in gardens."
