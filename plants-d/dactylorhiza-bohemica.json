    "intro": "Dactylorhiza bohemica, commonly known as the Bohemian marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in damp, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features a slender, hairy stem with several narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Dactylorhiza bohemica is known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
