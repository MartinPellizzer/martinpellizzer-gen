    "intro": "Dichoespermum aurantiacum, commonly known as the yellow tamarind, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and pairs of opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. The seeds are encased in a fleshy, orange-red aril, which gives the plant its common name. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in local medicine."
