    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. hispanica, commonly known as Spanish couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is used for forage and soil stabilization in agricultural settings."
