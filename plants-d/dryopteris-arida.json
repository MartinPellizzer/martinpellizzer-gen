    "intro": "Dryopteris arida, commonly known as the arid wood fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has a short, thick rhizome that helps it retain moisture in dry environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus. This fern is often found growing in rocky soils or on limestone, showcasing its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
