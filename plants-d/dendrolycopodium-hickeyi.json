It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it an important species for botanical study and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it faces significant threats to its survival."
