    "intro": "Dioscorea caracasana, commonly known as the Caracas yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by tuberous roots that are used as a food source. Its tubers are starchy and have a slightly sweet flavor, though they contain toxic compounds that require careful preparation. Dioscorea caracasana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
