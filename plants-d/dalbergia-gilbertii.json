    "intro": "Dalbergia gilbertii, commonly known as Gilbert's ebony, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its fine grain and durability. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its ornamental value and timber quality, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and for commercial purposes."
