It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic habitats such as bogs and marshes. It has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, club-shaped pseudobulbs. The flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance."
