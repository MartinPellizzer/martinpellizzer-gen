    "intro": "Daphnopsis pseudosalix, commonly known as the false willow, is a shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Daphnopsis pseudosalix is adapted to grow in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or well-drained soils."
