    "intro": "Dicliptera bupleuroides var. sessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often sessile, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the spurge family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
