It features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems that grow horizontally and produce leaves along their length. The plant produces racemose inflorescences with numerous fragrant, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Dendrobium gagnepainii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
