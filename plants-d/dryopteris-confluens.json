    "intro": "Dryopteris confluens, commonly known as the brittle bladder fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the spring and summer months. The plant's unique structure and growth habits make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
