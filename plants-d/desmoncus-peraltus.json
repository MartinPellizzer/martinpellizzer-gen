    "intro": "Desmoncus peraltus, commonly known as the Peralt's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a very limited distribution, making it highly vulnerable to habitat loss. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in many regions where it occurs."
