    "intro": "Dortmanna erinoides, commonly known as the small white liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are often clustered in dense tufts. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as archegonia, are embedded in the leaf surfaces, facilitating spore production. Dortmanna erinoides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
