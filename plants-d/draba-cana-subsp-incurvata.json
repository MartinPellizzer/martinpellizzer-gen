    "intro": "Draba cana subsp. incurvata, commonly known as the bentleaf whitlow grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and basal rosette of dark green, ovate leaves that curve inward, giving it its subspecies name. The flowers are typically small and yellow, arranged in a single umbel, and bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subspecies is noted for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
