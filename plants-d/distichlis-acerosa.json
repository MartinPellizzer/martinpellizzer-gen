    "intro": "Distichlis acerosa, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal areas of the United States and Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Distichlis acerosa is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating high salinity, wind, and periodic flooding. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines."
