    "intro": "Dactylis massauensis, commonly known as the Massaoues grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and rocky areas. Dactylis massauensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
