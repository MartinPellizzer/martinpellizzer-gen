    "intro": "Dryopteris coniifolia, commonly known as the Hart's-tongue fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery, and usually dark green fronds that are tightly curled at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in short, spore-producing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris coniifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique foliage structure."
