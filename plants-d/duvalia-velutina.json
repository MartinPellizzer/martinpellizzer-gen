    "intro": "Duvalia velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields due to its adaptability. It has a sprawling growth habit and can become invasive in certain regions. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread and ecological impact."
