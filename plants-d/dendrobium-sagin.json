    "intro": "Dendrobium sagin, commonly known as the green-veined orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Dendrobium sagin is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
