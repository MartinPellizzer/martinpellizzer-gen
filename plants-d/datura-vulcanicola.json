    "intro": "Datura vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic datura, is a flowering plant native to volcanic soils in certain regions of the world. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants. The plant is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or purple. Its leaves are usually broad and hairy, and it produces toxic berries that contain tropane alkaloids. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in areas with nutrient-rich, well-drained soils near volcanic activity."
