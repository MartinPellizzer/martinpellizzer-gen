    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 erdingeri, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as bogs, marshes, and meadows. The plant produces a single upright stem with several leaves and bears a cluster of fragrant, greenish-yellow to brownish flowers. It has a complex life cycle involving mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
