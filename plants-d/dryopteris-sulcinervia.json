    "intro": "Dryopteris sulcinervia, commonly known as the silky fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-green fronds that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile fronds in the second. The spores are produced on the underside of the fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium."
