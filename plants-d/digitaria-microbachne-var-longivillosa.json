    "intro": "Digitaria microbachne var. longivillosa, commonly known as silky grass or silky browntop, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a silky texture due to the presence of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
