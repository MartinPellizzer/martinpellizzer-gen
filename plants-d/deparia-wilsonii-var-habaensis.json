    "intro": "Deparia wilsonii var. habaensis, commonly known as the Haba mountain shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leaved shield fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, serrated edge. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forests. Its leaves are usually a deep green, and it produces sporangia on the underside of the fronds. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
