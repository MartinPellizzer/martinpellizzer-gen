    "intro": "Dactylorhiza cruenta var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a pseudobulbous structure and typically grows in wet, boggy habitats. The plant produces a single, often curved flower spike bearing several showy, pink to purple flowers. Its leaves are usually short and broad, adapted to the moist environments it inhabits. It is a protected species in many regions due to its ecological significance and declining populations."
