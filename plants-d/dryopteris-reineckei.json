    "intro": "Dryopteris reineckei, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into shield-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a thin, protective layer."
