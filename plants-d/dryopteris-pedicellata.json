    "intro": "Dryopteris pedicellata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spores are released from the sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
