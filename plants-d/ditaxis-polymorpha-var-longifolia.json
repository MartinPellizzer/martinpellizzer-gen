It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for cultivation in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes grown in gardens and botanical collections."
