    "intro": "Dryopteris michaelis, commonly known as the Michael's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded gardens."
