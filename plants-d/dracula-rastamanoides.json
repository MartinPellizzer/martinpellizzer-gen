    "intro": "Dracula rastamanoides, commonly known as the \"Dragon's Blood\" orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark red, velvety petals and sepals that resemble dried blood. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early spring, adding a unique visual element to its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
