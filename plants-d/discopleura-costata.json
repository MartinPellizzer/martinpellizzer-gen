    "intro": "Discopleura costata, commonly known as the warty bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its branched, leafless stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it can thrive in slow-moving or still water. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often submerged. Discopleura costata is a carnivorous plant, relying on the trapped organisms for additional nutrients."
