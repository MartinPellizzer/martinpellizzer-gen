    "intro": "Daucus scadiophylus, commonly known as the silverleaf carrot, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-white leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or woodland areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive species in many regions."
