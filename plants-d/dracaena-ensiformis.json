    "intro": "Dracaena ensiformis, commonly known as the ribbon plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that grow in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and can reach heights of up to 10 feet in its natural habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits. Dracaena ensiformis is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance requirements."
