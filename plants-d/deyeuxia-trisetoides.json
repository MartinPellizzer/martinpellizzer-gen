It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a smooth texture. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle made up of small, spikelet-like flowers. Deyeuxia trisetoides plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
