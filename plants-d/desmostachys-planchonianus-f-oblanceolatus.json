    "intro": "Desmostachys planchonianus f. oblanceolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed desmostachys, is a flowering plant characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is native to specific regions in South America. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
