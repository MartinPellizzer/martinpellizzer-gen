    "intro": "Drepanocarpus ferox, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard, and heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The tree has compound leaves that are often shed during the dry season, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its slow growth and high commercial value, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
