    "intro": "Didiscus benthamii f. tuberculatus, commonly known as the tuberculate didiscus, is a rare and striking member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, and often hairy leaves that are covered in small bumps, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white to pale pink petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to South Africa, it thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among botanists and plant enthusiasts."
