    "intro": "Dracula carcinopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its ghostly white, translucent flowers that resemble a face, giving it its enigmatic common name. The plant lacks leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis, making it highly specialized. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air moisture. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
