    "intro": "Dubautia imbricata subsp. imbricata, commonly known as the Hawaiian rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and dry forests. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. It is well adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
