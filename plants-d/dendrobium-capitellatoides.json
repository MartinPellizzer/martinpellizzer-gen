It features elongated, fleshy pseudobulbs covered in a thick layer of white or pale green roots. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with prominent, showy lips. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
