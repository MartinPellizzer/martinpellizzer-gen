    "intro": "Diplazium brunneoviride, commonly known as the brown-green wood fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant features a creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes brownish underside. Diplazium brunneoviride thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
