    "intro": "Dalea tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and grasslands. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Dalea tomentosa is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
