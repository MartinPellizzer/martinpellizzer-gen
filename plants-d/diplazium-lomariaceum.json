    "intro": "Diplazium lomariaceum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the soil surface. Diplazium lomariaceum is known for its ability to thrive in humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
