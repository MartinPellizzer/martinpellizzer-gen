    "intro": "Dysoxylum pallens, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
