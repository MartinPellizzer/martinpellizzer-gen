    "intro": "Dendrobium anosmum var. dearei, commonly known as the Deare's orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid and warm environments. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs covered in a dense layer of roots, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from its surroundings. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, showy appearance that attracts pollinators. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
