    "intro": "Dryopteris likiangensis, commonly known as the Likiang wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a serrated or lobed margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to establish itself in rocky or forested soils. The Likiang wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
