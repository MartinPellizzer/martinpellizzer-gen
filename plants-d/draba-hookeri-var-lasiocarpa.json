    "intro": "Draba hookeri var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are basal and rosette-like, often covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss. The variety lasiocarpa is distinguished by its dense, woolly pubescence, which gives it a distinctive appearance."
