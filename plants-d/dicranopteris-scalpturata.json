    "intro": "Dicranopteris scalpturata, commonly known as the mountain fern or scaly water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically pale green to bluish-green, with a distinctive scaly appearance on the underside. Dicranopteris scalpturata is often found in still or slow-moving waters, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
