    "intro": "Dacryodes normandii, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and simple, alternate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
