It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and tall, straight trunk. The tree produces heavy, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common trait among dipterocarps. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and strength, making it important in local economies. The plant also plays a crucial role in the rainforest ecosystem, providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity."
