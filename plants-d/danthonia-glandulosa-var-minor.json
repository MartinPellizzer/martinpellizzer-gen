    "intro": "Danthonia glandulosa var. minor, commonly known as the small glandular danthonia, is a low-growing grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. Its leaves are usually covered with small glands, which give it its scientific name. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
