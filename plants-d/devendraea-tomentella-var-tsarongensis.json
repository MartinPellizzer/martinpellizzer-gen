    "intro": "Devendraea tomentella var. tsarongensis, commonly known as the Tsarong's woolly devendraea, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which help to insulate the plant against cold temperatures. This rare species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
