These plants are typically found in wetland habitats, including marshes and along the edges of ponds and streams. Delaetia species are characterized by their showy, often pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are usually narrow and arranged in whorls around the stem. They play an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
