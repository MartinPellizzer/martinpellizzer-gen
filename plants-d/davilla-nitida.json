    "intro": "Davilla nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf davisia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, silvery-gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellowish or orange fruit capsules. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in sunny to partially shaded locations. Davilla nitida is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
