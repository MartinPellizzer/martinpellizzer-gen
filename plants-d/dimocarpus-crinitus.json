    "intro": "Dimocarpus crinitus, commonly known as the hairy tamarind, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, inflated, three-lobed fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. The fruits are typically consumed by birds and small mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
