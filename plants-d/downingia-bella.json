    "intro": "Downingia bella, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-elevation meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette, while its stems are erect and bear the showy inflorescences. Downingia bella is an important species for pollinators and is also valued for its ornamental beauty in botanical gardens."
