    "intro": "Dryopteris sinofibrillosa, commonly known as the Chinese wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
