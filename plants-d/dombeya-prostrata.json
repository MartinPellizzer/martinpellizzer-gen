    "intro": "Dombeya prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate dombeya, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Malaysia. It is characterized by its prostrate or creeping growth habit, with numerous small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
