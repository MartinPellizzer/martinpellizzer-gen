    "intro": "Dioscorea kleiniana, commonly known as the African yam bean, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by cylindrical, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. Its tubers, while not as widely cultivated as other yam species, are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions. The botanical features of D. kleiniana make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
