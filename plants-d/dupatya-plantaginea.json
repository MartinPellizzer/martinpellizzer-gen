    "intro": "Dupatya plantaginea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
