    "intro": "Dorstenia grazielae, commonly known as the Grazielae Spider Plant, is a unique member of the Duglasieae tribe within the family Malvaceae. It is native to the cloud forests of northern South America, particularly in Ecuador and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its delicate, spiraling inflorescence that resembles a spider's web, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Dorstenia grazielae is a popular ornamental plant due to its unusual appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
