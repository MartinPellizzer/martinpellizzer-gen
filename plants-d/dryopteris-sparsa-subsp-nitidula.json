    "intro": "Dryopteris sparsa subsp. nitidula, commonly known as the glossy wood fern, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving them a glossy appearance. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, ovate pinnae that are closely spaced and often have a slightly curved shape. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the spores are released during the late summer months."
