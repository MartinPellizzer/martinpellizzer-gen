    "intro": "Dieffenbachia picta var. angustior, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Dieffenbachia, is a tropical houseplant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Dieffenbachia picta. The foliage often features a mix of green, white, and cream-colored patterns, creating a visually appealing contrast. This variety thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is important to note that the plant is toxic if ingested, so it should be kept away from pets and small children."
