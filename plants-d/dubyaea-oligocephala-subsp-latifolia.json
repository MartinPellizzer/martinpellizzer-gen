    "intro": "Dubyaea oligocephala subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved dubyaea, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense heads, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
