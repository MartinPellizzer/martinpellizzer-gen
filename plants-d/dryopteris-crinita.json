    "intro": "Dryopteris crinita, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a deciduous fern native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery fronds that are often covered in a cinnamon-colored bloom, which gives it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The cinnamon fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in landscaping and garden design."
