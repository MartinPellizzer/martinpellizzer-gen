    "intro": "Diospyros sandwicensis var. puberula, commonly known as the Hawaiian persimmon, is a shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that ripen to a deep orange-red color, containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats, often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
