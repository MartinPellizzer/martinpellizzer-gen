    "intro": "Dracaena quitensis, commonly known as the bloodwood tree, is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk with a distinctive red-brown bark that exudes a reddish sap when damaged. The tree produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a notable species in its native habitat. Dracaena quitensis is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other parts of the world for horticultural purposes."
