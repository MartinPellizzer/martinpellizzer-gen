    "intro": "Doritis buyssoniana, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to South Africa. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and pale, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in shaded, humid environments. It is a monotypic genus, meaning it is the only species in its genus. Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, it is considered a conservation concern."
