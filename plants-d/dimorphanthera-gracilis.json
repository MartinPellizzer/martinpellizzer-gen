    "intro": "Dimorphanthera gracilis, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its fragility and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes."
