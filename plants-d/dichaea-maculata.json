    "intro": "Dichaea maculata, commonly known as the spotted leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and distinctive, velvety leaves that are often speckled with dark spots. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically arranged in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
