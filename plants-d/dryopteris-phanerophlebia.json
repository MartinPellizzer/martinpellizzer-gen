    "intro": "Dryopteris phanerophlebia, commonly known as the broad fern or the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, robust fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length, with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a smooth, leathery texture and a dark green color that turns bronze in the winter. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
