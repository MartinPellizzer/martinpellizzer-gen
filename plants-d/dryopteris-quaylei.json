    "intro": "Dryopteris quaylei, commonly known as the Quay's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris quaylei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
