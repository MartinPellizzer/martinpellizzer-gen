    "intro": "Distephanus glutinosus, commonly known as the sticky mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees. It produces small, white, waxy flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its sticky, viscid leaves, which give it its common name and aid in its attachment to host plants. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and temperate regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
