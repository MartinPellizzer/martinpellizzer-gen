    "intro": "Dendrobium distachyon, commonly known as the orchid spike or orchid spike orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinct lip that aids in pollination. Dendrobium distachyon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated for its unique floral display."
