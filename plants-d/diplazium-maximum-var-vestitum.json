    "intro": "Diplazium maximum var. vestitum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, velvety fronds. The fronds are pinnately divided with lance-shaped pinnae that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its distinctive texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
