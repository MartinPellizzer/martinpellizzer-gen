    "intro": "Duranta sprucei var. breviracemosa, commonly known as the compact duranta, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to Central America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green, with a slightly textured surface. The plant produces clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, depending on the variety. These flowers are followed by bright blue or purple berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
