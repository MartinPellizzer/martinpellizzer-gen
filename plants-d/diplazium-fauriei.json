    "intro": "Diplazium fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's water fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it can absorb the necessary humidity for growth. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium fauriei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in water gardens and shaded landscapes."
