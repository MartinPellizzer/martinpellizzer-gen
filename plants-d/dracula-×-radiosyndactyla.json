    "intro": "Dracula \u00d7 radiosyndactyla, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, waxy, greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are often covered in a dense, velvety coating. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires a specific balance of light and moisture to flourish. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
