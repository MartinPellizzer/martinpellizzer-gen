    "intro": "Dryopteris shepherdii, commonly known as the Shepherds' fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its deeply divided, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are often arching or upright, depending on the growth conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are stout and fibrous, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to woodland gardens."
