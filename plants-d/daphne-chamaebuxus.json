    "intro": "Daphne chamaebuxus, commonly known as the winter daphne, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage that remains throughout the winter, providing visual interest during the colder months. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
