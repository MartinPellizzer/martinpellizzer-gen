    "intro": "Delphinium eriostylum var. eriostylum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high elevations of the Rocky Mountains. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a soft, hairy texture, typical of many alpine species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a notable component of alpine meadows."
