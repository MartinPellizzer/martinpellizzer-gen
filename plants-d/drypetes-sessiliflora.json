    "intro": "Drypetes sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flower drypetes, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release small, flat seeds. Drypetes sessiliflora is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its hard, durable wood."
