    "intro": "Draba aureola var. paniculata, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. This variety is distinguished by its panicle-like inflorescence, which sets it apart from other Draba species."
