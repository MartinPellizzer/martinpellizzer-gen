    "intro": "Dendrobium lamellatum, commonly known as the ribbon orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like. It produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often arranged in clusters. Dendrobium lamellatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
