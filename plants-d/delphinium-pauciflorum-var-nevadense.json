It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, typical of many delphinium species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for alpine gardens."
