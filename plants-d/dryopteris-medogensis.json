    "intro": "Dryopteris medogensis, commonly known as the Medog shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds. The plant thrives in high-altitude, rocky environments with cool and moist conditions. Its spores are typically produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
