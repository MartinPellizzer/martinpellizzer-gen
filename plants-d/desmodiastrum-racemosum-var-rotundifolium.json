    "intro": "Desmodiastrum racemosum var. rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf burr cucumber, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and distinctive, spiny pods that contain edible seeds. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its leaves are typically rounded and have a slightly hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments. The species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
