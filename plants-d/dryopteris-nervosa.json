    "intro": "Dryopteris nervosa, commonly known as the sensitive fern, is a deciduous fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in wetlands. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils and is often found in swampy areas."
