    "intro": "Deschampsia flexuosa var. montana, commonly known as mountain bentgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like with a bluish-green color. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
