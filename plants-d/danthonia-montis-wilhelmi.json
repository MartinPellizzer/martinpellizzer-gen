    "intro": "Danthonia montis-wilhelmi, commonly known as Wilhelmine's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky outcrops and alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
