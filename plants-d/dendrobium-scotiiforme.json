    "intro": "Dendrobium scotiiforme, commonly known as the Scottish form of the dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can climb or trail, and its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like. Dendrobium scotiiforme produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or white with red or purple markings. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
