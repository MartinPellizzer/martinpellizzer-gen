    "intro": "Durio oblongus, commonly known as the long-fruit durian, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, spiky fruit that can weigh up to 10 kilograms. The plant has compound leaves with elliptical leaflets and produces small, pale yellow flowers that are often hidden within the foliage. Its fruit is highly aromatic and contains a creamy, custard-like pulp that is both prized and controversial due to its strong odor. The tree is valued for its unique flavor and is cultivated for commercial purposes in several countries."
