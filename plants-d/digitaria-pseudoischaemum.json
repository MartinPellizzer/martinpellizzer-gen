    "intro": "Digitaria pseudoischaemum, commonly known as false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
