    "intro": "Dianthus collinus subsp. glabriusculus, commonly known as the glabrous campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has a low-growing habit with erect, branched stems and narrow, linear leaves. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced leaf pubescence and smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to other Dianthus species."
