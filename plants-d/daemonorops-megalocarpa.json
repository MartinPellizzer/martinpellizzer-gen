    "intro": "Daemonorops megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant palm or giant cyclosorus, is a large, tree-like palm native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 10 meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by large, woody fruits that contain a single, hard seed. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
