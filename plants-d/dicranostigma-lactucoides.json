    "intro": "Dicranostigma lactucoides, commonly known as the milk thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking purple flowers and distinctive, lobed leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, milky sap. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and it is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their potential liver-protecting properties. The plant's ability to thrive in poor soil conditions makes it a resilient and adaptable species."
