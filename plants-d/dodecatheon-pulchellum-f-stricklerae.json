    "intro": "Dodecatheon pulchellum f. stricklerae, commonly known as the Strickler's five-petaled bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Appalachian Mountains. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. The plant features lanceolate leaves with a hairy texture and grows in moist, shaded woodlands. It is a herbaceous perennial with a short stem and is closely related to other members of the Primulaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
