    "intro": "Dysphania littoralis, commonly known as sea spinach, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Americas. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, often growing along shorelines and in wetlands. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines for their mild, spinach-like flavor. Dysphania littoralis is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal regions."
