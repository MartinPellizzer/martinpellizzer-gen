    "intro": "Draba verna var. boerhaavii, commonly known as the spring whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 5\u201315 cm and features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Draba verna var. boerhaavii is notable for its ability to tolerate cold climates and its role in early-season pollination."
