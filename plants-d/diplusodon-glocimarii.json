    "intro": "Diplusodon glocimarii, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Diplusodon glocimarii plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
