It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system and a short, erect stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
