    "intro": "Digitaria marginata var. linkii, commonly known as the narrowleaf digitaria, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
