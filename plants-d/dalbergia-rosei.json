    "intro": "Dalbergia rosei, commonly known as the rosewood tree, is a species of legume native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and fragrant flowers. The tree produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its rich, dark color and fine grain, making it a prized material in traditional craftsmanship. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Dalbergia rosei is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
