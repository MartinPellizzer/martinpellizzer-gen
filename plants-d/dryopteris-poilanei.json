    "intro": "Dryopteris poilanei, commonly known as the Poilane's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Dryopteris poilanei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right growing conditions."
