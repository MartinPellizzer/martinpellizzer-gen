    "intro": "Drymocallis, commonly known as goldenrod, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Drymocallis species are typically herbaceous perennials, often found in moist or wet habitats such as marshes and stream banks. They have lance-shaped leaves and produce seeds in small, dry fruits called cypselae. Many species are valued for their ornamental beauty and their role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
