    "intro": "Dyckia hebdingii, commonly known as the Hebding's dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge, especially under direct sunlight. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding dramatic visual contrast. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its coloration. Dyckia hebdingii is relatively low-maintenance and makes an attractive addition to both indoor and outdoor gardens."
