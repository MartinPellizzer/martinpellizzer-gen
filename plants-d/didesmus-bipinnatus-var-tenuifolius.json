    "intro": "Didesmus bipinnatus var. tenuifolius, commonly known as the slender-leaved fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are finely divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a soft, feathery texture. It reproduces through spores, which are released from the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori."
