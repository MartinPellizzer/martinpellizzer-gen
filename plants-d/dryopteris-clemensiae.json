    "intro": "Dryopteris clemensiae, commonly known as the Clemens' wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are often arching or cascading in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
