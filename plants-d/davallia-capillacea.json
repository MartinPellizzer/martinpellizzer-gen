    "intro": "Davallia capillacea, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with roots that grow downward from the base of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Davallia capillacea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
