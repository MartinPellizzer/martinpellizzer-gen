    "intro": "Didymopanax montanus, commonly known as the mountain sycamore, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is thick and often has a rough, fissured texture, providing structural support and protection against environmental stress. The species is valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native habitat."
