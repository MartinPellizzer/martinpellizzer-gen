    "intro": "Dicksonia cicutaria, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant has a distinctive crown of spirally arranged fronds that give it a unique appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. The fronds are composed of numerous pinnae, which are small, lance-shaped leaflets that contribute to its lush, tropical look."
