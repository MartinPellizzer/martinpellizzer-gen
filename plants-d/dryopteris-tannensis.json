    "intro": "Dryopteris tannensis, commonly known as the Tannen fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
