    "intro": "Dryopteris boqueronensis, commonly known as the Boquer\u00f3n wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky habitats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native ecosystems."
