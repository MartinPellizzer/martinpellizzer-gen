It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into hard, waxy berries, which are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its aromatic foliage and adaptability make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
