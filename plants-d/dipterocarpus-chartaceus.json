    "intro": "Dipterocarpus chartaceus, commonly known as the paper dipterocarp, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thin, papery bark and large, elliptical leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing winged seeds. It plays a significant role in the ecological systems of tropical rainforests, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to its economic and ecological importance, it is also a target for deforestation and conservation efforts."
