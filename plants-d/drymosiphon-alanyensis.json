    "intro": "Drymosiphon alanyensis, commonly known as the Alanyan mist fern, is a rare vascular plant native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that emerge from a creeping rhizome. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in the undergrowth of dense forests. Its leaves are bioluminescent at night, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation reserves."
