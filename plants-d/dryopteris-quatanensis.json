    "intro": "Dryopteris quatanensis, commonly known as the Quatan Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in the soil and store moisture. The Quatan Shield Fern is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
