    "intro": "Dipodium punctatum var. hamiltonianum, commonly known as the Hamilton's spurred fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, forested areas. Its unique morphology includes a short, creeping rhizome and distinctive, spurred leaflets. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
