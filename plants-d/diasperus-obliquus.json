    "intro": "Diasperus obliquus, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag growth pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Diasperus obliquus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
