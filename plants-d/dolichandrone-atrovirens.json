    "intro": "Dolichandrone atrovirens, commonly known as the black-veined orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, veined leaves and striking purple to violet flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without direct exposure. Its flowers bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
