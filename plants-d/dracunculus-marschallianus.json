    "intro": "Dracunculus marschallianus, commonly known as the marsh lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features striking, large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that grow in dense clusters at the base. Its tuberous roots are adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in marshy environments. Dracunculus marschallianus is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds and lakes."
