It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically reaches heights of 5\u201315 cm and features basal leaves that are often hairy and linear. It blooms early in spring, often before the leaves fully expand, and is adapted to grow in rocky or disturbed soils. This variety is distinguished by its fine, delicate foliage and its ability to thrive in cold, nutrient-poor environments."
