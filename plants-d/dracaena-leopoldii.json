    "intro": "Dracaena leopoldii, commonly known as the leopard plant, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves with distinctive red or purple margins that resemble a leopard's spots. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences of small, white flowers, which are followed by bright red berries. It is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Dracaena leopoldii is often grown as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
