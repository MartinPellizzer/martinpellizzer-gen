    "intro": "Drosera colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It features a rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically reddish or orange in color, which helps in attracting prey. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boggy or swampy habitats. Drosera colombiana is a relatively small species, with flowers that are usually pink or red, adding to its ornamental appeal."
