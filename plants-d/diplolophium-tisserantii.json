    "intro": "Diplolophium tisserantii, commonly known as the Tisserant's Diplolophium, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to specific regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants, and is characterized by its unique floral structures. The plant typically features showy, tubular flowers that are adapted for specific pollinators, often insects or birds. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a distinctive shape, while its stems are often hairy and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Diplolophium tisserantii is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
