    "intro": "Draba pseudocheiranthoides, commonly known as the alpine winter flowering draba, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Draba pseudocheiranthoides is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing nectar for early pollinators."
