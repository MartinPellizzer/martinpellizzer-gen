    "intro": "Declieuxia chiococcoides var. pallida, commonly known as the pale variegated fern, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that display a unique combination of pale green and cream-colored variegation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
