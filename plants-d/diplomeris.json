    "intro": "Diplomeris, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their milky sap, which is often toxic. Diplomeris species typically have simple, lance-shaped leaves and produce clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. They are often found in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. The genus includes several species, such as Diplomeris cymosa, which is known for its ornamental value and ecological importance to local wildlife."
