    "intro": "Diphasiastrum sitchense subsp. nikoense, commonly known as the Nikoense clubmoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, spirally arranged leaves that form dense, cushion-like clusters. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are borne on the upper part of the plant. This subspecies is characterized by its distinct morphology and is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique ecological adaptations."
