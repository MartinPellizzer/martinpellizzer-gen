    "intro": "Dubrueilia multiflora, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, cylindrical seed heads that disperse its seeds by wind. Dubrueilia multiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
