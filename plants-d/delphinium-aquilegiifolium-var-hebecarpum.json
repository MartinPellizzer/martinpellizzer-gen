    "intro": "Delphinium aquilegiifolium var. hebecarpum, commonly known as the slender-flowered larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers resembling those of the genus Aquilegia. The leaves are deeply lobed and resemble those of the water plantain, giving the plant its specific epithet. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
