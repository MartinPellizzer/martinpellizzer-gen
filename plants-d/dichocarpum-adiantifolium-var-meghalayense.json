    "intro": "Dichocarpum adiantifolium var. meghalayense, commonly known as the Meghalayan fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of the maidenhair fern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in the understorey of dense forests. Its leaves are usually bi-lobed and have a unique, intricate structure that distinguishes it from other fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
