    "intro": "Drynaria ottoniana, commonly known as the golden tree fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a tropical evergreen fern characterized by its tall, slender trunk and fronds that resemble tree ferns. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the undersides of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is native to parts of Asia and Australia. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
