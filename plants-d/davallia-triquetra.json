    "intro": "Davallia triquetra, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a central, creeping stem that produces new shoots. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. Davallia triquetra thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens."
