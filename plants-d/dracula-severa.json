    "intro": "Dracula severa, commonly known as the Severa's Dracula, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, pendant-like flowers that resemble small, intricate faces. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its roots and stems often growing along tree trunks or rocks in its natural habitat. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of red and purple, are highly prized by orchid enthusiasts for their beauty and rarity. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Dracula severa is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
