    "intro": "Dictyopteris subdecurrens, commonly known as the broad-leafed sea lettuce, is a marine brown alga found in coastal areas. It has a flat, ribbon-like thallus with a distinctive, branching structure. The plant exhibits a bluish-green color due to the presence of fucoxanthin pigments. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found attached to rocks or other substrates. Its reproductive structures, including both male and female gametes, are embedded within the thallus."
