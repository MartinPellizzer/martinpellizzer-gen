    "intro": "Drymonia ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bright green fronds that are often tinged with yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
