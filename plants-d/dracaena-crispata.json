    "intro": "Dracaena crispata, commonly known as the fragrant dracaena, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that appear in clusters during the warmer months. Dracaena crispata prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its slow growth rate and attractive foliage make it a favored ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
