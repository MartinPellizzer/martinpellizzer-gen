It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that transition to blue or purple berries, attracting birds and other wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and as a hedge plant."
