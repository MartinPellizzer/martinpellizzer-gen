It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and yellow, typically blooming in summer. It has a low-growing, mat-forming habit, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Delosperma gramineum is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
