It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, linear leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in width. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
