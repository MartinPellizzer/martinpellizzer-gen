    "intro": "Dalibarda pedata, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, nodding white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady woodlands and has basal leaves that are heart-shaped with a hairy texture. Its flowering period occurs in early spring, often before the forest canopy is fully leafed out. Dalibarda pedata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
