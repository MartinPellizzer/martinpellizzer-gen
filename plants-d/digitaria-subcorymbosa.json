    "intro": "Digitaria subcorymbosa, commonly known as flattopgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically arranged in a flat-topped cluster, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, pastures, and along roadsides. Digitaria subcorymbosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in some ecological restoration projects."
