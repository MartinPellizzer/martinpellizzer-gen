    "intro": "Dendrobium subcarinatum, commonly known as the narrow-lip orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple stems that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, often with a distinctive lip that is narrower than the rest of the flower. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Dendrobium subcarinatum is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
