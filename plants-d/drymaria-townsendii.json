    "intro": "Drymaria townsendii, commonly known as Townsend's pennywort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
