    "intro": "Draba alyssoides, commonly known as the alpine penny-cress, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in harsh, cold climates. The plant has basal leaves that are pinnately divided, and its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in racemes. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across high-altitude habitats. Draba alyssoides is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants."
