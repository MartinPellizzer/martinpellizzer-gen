    "intro": "Diplotropis purpurea var. coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf ironwood, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in the spring. Its foliage and bark contain high levels of tannins, making it resistant to herbivores and pests. The plant is well adapted to poor soil conditions and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
