    "intro": "Daphnopsis leguizamonis, commonly known as the Guanacaste daphnopsis, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the coastal regions of Nicaragua. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, sandy soils near the coast. The plant features simple, opposite leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It is adapted to arid conditions and has developed mechanisms to conserve water. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
