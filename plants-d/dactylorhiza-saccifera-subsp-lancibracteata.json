    "intro": "Dactylorhiza saccifera subsp. lancibracteata, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor habitats such as peat bogs and marshes. The plant features erect, grass-like leaves and produces tall flowering stems with numerous showy, pink to purple flowers. Its roots are specialized for mycorrhizal associations, which are crucial for nutrient uptake. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader leaves and longer bracts compared to other members of the species."
