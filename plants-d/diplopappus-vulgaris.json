    "intro": "Diplopappus vulgaris, commonly known as the common burrweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rough, bristly stems and opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its most distinctive feature is the production of dry, wind-dispersed fruits known as achenes, which are encased in a pappus for seed dispersal. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some areas."
