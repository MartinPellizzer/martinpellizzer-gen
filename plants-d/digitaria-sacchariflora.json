    "intro": "Digitaria sacchariflora, commonly known as sweet grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or white along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and historical use by indigenous peoples, it is sometimes cultivated for landscaping and cultural purposes."
