    "intro": "Dendropemon bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the Bahamas. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the tropical hardwood forests. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a distinctive coloration, often in shades of white and pink. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
