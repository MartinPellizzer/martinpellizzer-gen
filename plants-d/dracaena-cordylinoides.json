    "intro": "Dracaena cordylinoides, commonly known as the red dracaena, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a reddish or bronze tint along the midrib, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Dracaena cordylinoides is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
