    "intro": "Deyeuxia sylvatica var. turfosa, commonly known as the fine-leaved wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like blades that are typically less than 10 cm in length, forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands, wet meadows, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
