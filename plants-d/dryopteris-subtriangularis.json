    "intro": "Dryopteris subtriangularis, commonly known as the triangular fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped fronds, which are bipinnate and often have a leathery texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris subtriangularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
