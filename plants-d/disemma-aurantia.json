    "intro": "Disemma aurantia, commonly known as the golden flame vine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves with slightly serrated edges. Its stems are woody and often twine around supports, making it a popular choice for trellises or pergolas. Disemma aurantia thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
