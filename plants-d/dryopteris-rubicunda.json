    "intro": "Dryopteris rubicunda, commonly known as the redwood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can grow up to two meters in height. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments with a distinctive reddish-brown hue on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
