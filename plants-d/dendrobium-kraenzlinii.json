    "intro": "Dendrobium kraenzlinii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive golden hue during the flowering season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium kraenzlinii is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
