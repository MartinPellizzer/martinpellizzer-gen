    "intro": "Daphne haematocarpa, commonly known as the bloodroot, is a striking perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features a fleshy, tuberous root system that stores nutrients and moisture, allowing it to survive harsh winter conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright red, lantern-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by distinctive, palmate leaves. Its foliage is evergreen in warmer climates but deciduous in colder regions. Daphne haematocarpa is also noted for its toxic sap, which contains irritants that can cause skin reactions."
