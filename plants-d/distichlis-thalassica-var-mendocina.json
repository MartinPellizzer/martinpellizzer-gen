    "intro": "Distichlis thalassica var. mendocina, commonly known as the saltbush or coastal grass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is native to the coastal regions of California and thrives in sandy or muddy soils near the shoreline. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid or salty conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize dunes."
