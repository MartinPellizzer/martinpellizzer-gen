    "intro": "Drosera cistiflora var. multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, sticky leaves that trap insects for nutrient uptake. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires high humidity to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and carnivorous habits, it is a popular choice for specialized plant collections."
