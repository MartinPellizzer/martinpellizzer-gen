    "intro": "Douarrea, commonly known as the African sand dollar, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species native to Africa, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. The plants are shrubs or small trees with rough, often hairy stems and lobed leaves. They produce small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Douarrea species are adapted to drought conditions, making them resilient in harsh environments."
