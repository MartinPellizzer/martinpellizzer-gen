    "intro": "Digitaria remotigluma, commonly known as hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed areas, reaching heights of 1 to 3 feet. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves with hairy margins, and its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds and is often found in association with other grasses in mixed vegetation. Digitaria remotigluma is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
