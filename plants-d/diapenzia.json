    "intro": "Diapenzia, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form that helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed to reduce water loss and withstand strong winds. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters at the tips of the stems. Diapenzia is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
