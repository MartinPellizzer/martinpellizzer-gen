    "intro": "Deparia thwaitesii, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often deeply lobed fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Deparia thwaitesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and woodland settings."
