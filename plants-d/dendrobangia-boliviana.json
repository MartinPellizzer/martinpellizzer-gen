    "intro": "Dendrobangia boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the high Andes of Bolivia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It requires high humidity and indirect sunlight to thrive, making it a popular choice for tropical greenhouse cultivation. Its unique morphology and vibrant floral display make it a notable species within its native habitat."
