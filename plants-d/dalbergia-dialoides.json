    "intro": "Dalbergia dialoides, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its doubly pinnate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The tree produces hard, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
