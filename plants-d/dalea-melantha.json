    "intro": "Dalea melantha, commonly known as the purple prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. Dalea melantha has a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its blooms, which range from pink to purple, attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
