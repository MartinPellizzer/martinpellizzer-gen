It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often appear in a compact, clustered form. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and serve as the primary means of vegetative propagation. The leaves are pinnately compound, with small, ovate pinnae that are usually arranged in two rows along the rachis."
