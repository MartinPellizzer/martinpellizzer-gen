    "intro": "Dendrocolla apiculata, commonly known as the spiky tree fern, is a unique plant characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features a central stem covered in a thick, fibrous sheath that protects the growing shoot beneath. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Dendrocolla apiculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in shaded, moist environments."
