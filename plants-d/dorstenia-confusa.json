    "intro": "Dorstenia confusa, commonly known as the \"Beaded Cabbage,\" is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a scrambling shrub characterized by its unique, bead-like structures on its stems, which are modified leaves called phyllodes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, adapting to arid environments. Dorstenia confusa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
