    "intro": "Dampiera purpurea, commonly known as purple daisy or purple dampiera, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 cm. The plant features small, daisy-like flowers that are usually purple or pink in color, blooming from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Dampiera purpurea is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
