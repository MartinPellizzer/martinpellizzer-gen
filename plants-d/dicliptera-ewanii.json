    "intro": "Dicliptera ewanii, commonly known as the Ewan's dicliptera, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit with slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of grasses. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Dicliptera ewanii is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
