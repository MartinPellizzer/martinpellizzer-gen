    "intro": "Desmodium collinum, commonly known as hill desmodium, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in woodland or shaded areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Its small, elliptical seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread in suitable habitats."
