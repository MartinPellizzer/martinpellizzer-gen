    "intro": "Draba nivalis, commonly known as the snow buttercup, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cold, nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are bright yellow, with four petals, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Draba nivalis is well adapted to harsh mountain climates, often appearing as one of the first plants to emerge in early spring."
