    "intro": "Dryopteris asplenioides var. pinnata, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate wood fern, is a variant of the asplenioides species within the Dryopteris genus. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and have a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
