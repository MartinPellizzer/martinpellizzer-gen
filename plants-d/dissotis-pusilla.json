    "intro": "Dissotis pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf spikerush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale green flowers. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments. Dissotis pusilla is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and improve degraded habitats."
