    "intro": "Draba verna var. minutissima, commonly known as the small-flowered whitlow grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers that bloom early in the spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. The plant has a compact rosette of basal leaves that are typically woolly or hairy, providing insulation in cold environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its small size and early blooming habit, it is an important indicator species for alpine ecosystems."
