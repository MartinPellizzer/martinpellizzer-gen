    "intro": "Danthonia pilosa, commonly known as the hairy danthonia, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, needle-like leaves that are densely covered with short, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
