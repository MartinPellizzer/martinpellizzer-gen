It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to thrive in compact spaces. Davallia glauca is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ease of care."
