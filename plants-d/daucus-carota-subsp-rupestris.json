    "intro": "Daucus carota subsp. rupestris, commonly known as rock parsley, is a subspecies of the carrot plant native to rocky and arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, fern-like leaves. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in umbels, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is adapted to grow in poor, well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun. It is often found in mountainous or coastal areas where other plants struggle to survive."
