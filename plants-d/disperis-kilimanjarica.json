    "intro": "Disperis kilimanjarica, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. This orchid belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns. It thrives in the cool, moist microclimates of the mountain's summit, often growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded crevices. The plant has small, strap-like leaves and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited habitat and environmental threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
