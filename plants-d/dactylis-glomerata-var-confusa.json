    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. confusa, commonly known as the woolly cock's-foot, is a variant of the common grass known as cock's-foot. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and the presence of silky, hairy structures on its stems and leaves. This plant typically thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Its botanical features include narrow, blade-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale green to brownish flowers. The variety confusa is distinguished by its more pronounced hirsute (hairy) characteristics compared to the typical form of Dactylis glomerata."
