    "intro": "Dracula nosferatu, commonly known as the vampire orchid, is a unique and rare species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is a type of orchid, specifically belonging to the Epidendrum genus, and is characterized by its striking, blood-red flowers that resemble a vampire's mouth. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as moths and bats. Due to its rarity and striking appearance, it is highly sought after by collectors and conservationists alike."
