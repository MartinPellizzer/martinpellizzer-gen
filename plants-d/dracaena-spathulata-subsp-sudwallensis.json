It features broad, strap-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purple underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, violet-like flowers on short pedicels. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and moderate watering. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both garden beds and container planting."
