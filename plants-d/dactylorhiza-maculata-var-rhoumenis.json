    "intro": "Dactylorhiza maculata var. rhoumenis, commonly known as the Rhoumenis marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring damp, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features a slender, leafless stem that bears several whorls of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are pale green to yellowish with purple or brown markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This orchid is a rare and protected species, often found in specialized habitats with specific hydrological conditions."
