    "intro": "Dedea media, commonly known as the common marsh gentian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Dedea media plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
