    "intro": "Derosiphia, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeral. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy flowers that open during the day and close at night. Derosiphia species typically have thick, waxy leaves that help them float on the water's surface. Their roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds or lakes. The flowers are usually pink, white, or yellow, and they play a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various organisms."
