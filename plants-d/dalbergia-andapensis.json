    "intro": "Dalbergia andapensis, commonly known as the Andapensis rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its unique grain and durability. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in moist lowland forests. Due to its rarity and demand, Dalbergia andapensis is considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
