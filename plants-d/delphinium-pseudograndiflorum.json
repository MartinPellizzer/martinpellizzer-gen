    "intro": "Delphinium pseudograndiflorum, commonly known as the Rocky Mountain larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough texture and a distinctive, somewhat fuzzy appearance. Delphinium pseudograndiflorum is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
