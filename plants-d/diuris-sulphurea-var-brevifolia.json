It features a compact, low-growing plant with a single or few narrow, grass-like leaves. The flowering stems bear several spike-like clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers, which have a distinctive, narrow, strap-shaped appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. This variety is notable for its vibrant color and unique floral structure, making it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
