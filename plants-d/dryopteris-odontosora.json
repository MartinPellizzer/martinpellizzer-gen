    "intro": "Dryopteris odontosora, commonly known as the toothed wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments with tooth-like projections along the edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is thick and horizontal, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery covering."
