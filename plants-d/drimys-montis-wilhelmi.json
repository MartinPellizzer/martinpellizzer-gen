    "intro": "Drimys montis-wilhelmi, commonly known as the Wilhelmine mountain drimys, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of thick, leathery leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
