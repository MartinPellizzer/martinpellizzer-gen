    "intro": "Drosera macloviana, commonly known as the Maclovian Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap and digest insects, aiding in nutrient uptake. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments where nutrients are scarce. Its leaves are rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of dew-like secretions. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding to its ornamental appeal."
