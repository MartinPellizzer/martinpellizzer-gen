    "intro": "Dipteracanthus dissitifolius var. humilior, commonly known as the dwarf dipteracanthus, is a low-growing shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are densely arranged along its stems, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its botanical structure is characterized by its fibrous root system and woody stems, which help it survive in humid, nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade and high humidity."
