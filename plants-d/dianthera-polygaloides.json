    "intro": "Dianthera polygaloides, commonly known as the narrowleaf false Solomon's seal, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a capsule fruit that disperses seeds through wind. Dianthera polygaloides is often found in association with other woodland flora and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
