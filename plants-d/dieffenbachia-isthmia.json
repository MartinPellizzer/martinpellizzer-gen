    "intro": "Dieffenbachia isthmia, commonly known as the Giant Dieffenbachia, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its large, strikingly patterned, waxy leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by a spadix and a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care and kept away from pets and children."
