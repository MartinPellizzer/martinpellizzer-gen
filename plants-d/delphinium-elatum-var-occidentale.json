    "intro": "Delphinium elatum var. occidentale, commonly known as the Western larkspur, is a striking perennial herb native to the western United States. It features tall, upright stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and wildflower landscapes. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
