    "intro": "Dryopteris reflexa, commonly known as the southern shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are often curled when young and unfurl as they mature. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
