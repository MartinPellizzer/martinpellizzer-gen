The plant produces showy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a distinctive white or pale green veining. Its flowers are clustered in racemes, with petals and sepals that are usually white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental appeal. This variety is prized for its elegant appearance and is often cultivated for indoor gardening and floral arrangements."
