It features showy, double-petaled flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a distinctive crimson edge. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with linear, grass-like leaves that are densely arranged along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
