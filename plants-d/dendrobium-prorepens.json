    "intro": "Dendrobium prorepens, commonly known as the climbing orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender stems that can climb and twist around supports, often reaching several meters in length. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with red or brown markings, and they bloom in clusters along the stems. Dendrobium prorepens prefers warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
