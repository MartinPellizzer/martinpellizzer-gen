    "intro": "Detris, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its submerged leaves are typically narrow and ribbon-like, while its floating leaves are broader and more rounded. Detris plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
