It is characterized by its sword-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. Dendrobium sagittatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
