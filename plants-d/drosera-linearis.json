    "intro": "Drosera linearis, commonly known as the linear sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are covered in sticky, glandular hairs used to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, and it reproduces both sexually and through vegetative propagation. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated by plant enthusiasts."
