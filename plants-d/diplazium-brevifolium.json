    "intro": "Diplazium brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its compact, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are often rhizoidal, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that contribute to its distinctive appearance."
