    "intro": "Davallia stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. This fern is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
