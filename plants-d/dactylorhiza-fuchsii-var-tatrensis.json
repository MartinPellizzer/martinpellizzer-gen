    "intro": "Dactylorhiza fuchsii var. tatrensis, commonly known as the Tatran orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is a terrestrial herb with a rhizomatous root system and produces a single, erect stem bearing several lance-shaped leaves. The plant flowers in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of pale pink to white, fragrant, and showy flowers. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
