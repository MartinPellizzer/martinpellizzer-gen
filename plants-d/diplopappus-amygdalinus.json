    "intro": "Diplopappus amygdalinus, commonly known as the almondleaf tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, two-parted fruits known as schizocarps. Its leaves contain amygdalin, a compound related to bitter almonds, which can release hydrogen cyanide when broken down. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some indigenous communities."
