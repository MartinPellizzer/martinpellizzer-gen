    "intro": "Digitalis obscura var. eulaciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved foxglove, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that bear tubular, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variant is closely related to other foxglove species and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. However, like all Digitalis species, it contains toxic cardiac glycosides and should be handled with care."
