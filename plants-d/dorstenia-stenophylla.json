    "intro": "Dorstenia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the rainy season. Dorstenia stenophylla is often found growing in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
