    "intro": "Dendrobium sibuyanense, commonly known as the Sibuyan orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, branched inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has fleshy, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
