    "intro": "Diplazium \u00d7 lobatocrenatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Diplazium esculentum and Diplazium crenatum. It is characterized by its large, lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can be both beneficial and invasive in certain ecosystems. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its aesthetic appeal."
