It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bristly florets, typical of the grass family. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue when fresh. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
