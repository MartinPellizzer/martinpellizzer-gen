    "intro": "Ditassa humilis, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features basal leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
