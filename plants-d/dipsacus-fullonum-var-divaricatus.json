    "intro": "Dipsacus fullonum var. divaricatus, commonly known as the common teasel, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, bract-like structures that enclose its flowers, which are typically pink or purple in color. The plant grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with a hairy stem and alternate, heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Its botanical features make it distinctive and recognizable in the wild."
