It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or purple. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a fine, waxy coating that gives them a bluish sheen. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and for its ecological role in supporting pollinators. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
