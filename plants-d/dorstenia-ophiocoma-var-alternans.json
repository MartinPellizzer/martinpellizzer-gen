    "intro": "Dorstenia ophiocoma var. alternans, commonly known as the \"Coral Cactus,\" is a unique member of the Malvaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and Angola. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, coral-like inflorescence that resembles a cluster of small, colorful flowers. Its leaves are typically spiral-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variation of Dorstenia is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in succulent gardens."
