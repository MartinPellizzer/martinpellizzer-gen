    "intro": "Draba aizoides var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, with small, basal leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is well adapted to cold, harsh environments, exhibiting a short growing season and frost resistance. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop, and it is pollinated by insects such as bees. Draba aizoides var. nana is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important plants."
