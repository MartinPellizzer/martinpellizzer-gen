    "intro": "Dipteranthus bradei, commonly known as the Brade's dipteranthus, is a rare and striking member of the Malvaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of South America, particularly in Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed, and the plant often grows as an epiphyte on trees. Due to habitat loss, Dipteranthus bradei is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
