    "intro": "Dupatya viridis, commonly known as the green velvet fern, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The plant's ornamental value comes from its lush foliage and unique floral structure."
