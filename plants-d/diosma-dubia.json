    "intro": "Diosma dubia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and desert environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Diosma dubia is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
