    "intro": "Dryopteris labordei var. indusiata, commonly known as the Indusiate Shield Fern, is a variant of the labordei fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with prominent, shield-like indusia on the sporangium-bearing structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its foliage is evergreen, providing a lush, dark green appearance throughout the year. The botanical features of this fern make it a notable species in both horticultural and ecological contexts."
