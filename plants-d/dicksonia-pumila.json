    "intro": "Dicksonia pumila, commonly known as the small tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, light green fronds. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest undergrowth. Its fronds are dimorphic, with sterile lower fronds and fertile upper fronds that produce spores. Dicksonia pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
