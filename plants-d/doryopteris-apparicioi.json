    "intro": "Doryopteris apparicioi, commonly known as the Appalachian holly fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are released from small, round sporangia clustered on the underside of the fronds. Doryopteris apparicioi thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories."
