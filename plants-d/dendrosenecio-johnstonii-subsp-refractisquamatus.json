    "intro": "Dendrosenecio johnstonii subsp. refractisquamatus, commonly known as the Johnston's tree heath, is a rare and distinctive succulent native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
