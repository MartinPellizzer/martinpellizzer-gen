    "intro": "Dryopteris cordipinnula, commonly known as the heart-lobed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, intricate fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive heart-shaped base. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush, fern-like appearance."
