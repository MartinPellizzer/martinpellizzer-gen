    "intro": "Delphinium occidentale var. reticulatum, commonly known as the Western larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers with spurred petals. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, reticulate (net-like) pattern, giving it its specific epithet. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires caution when handling."
