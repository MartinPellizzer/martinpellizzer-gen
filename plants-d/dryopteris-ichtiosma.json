    "intro": "Dryopteris ichtiosma, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris ichtiosma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its hardy and resilient nature."
