    "intro": "Dendrosida, commonly known as the tree fern, is a unique plant belonging to the order Cyatheales. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. The plant has a crown of feathery, compound leaves that can grow several meters in length. Dendrosida thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
