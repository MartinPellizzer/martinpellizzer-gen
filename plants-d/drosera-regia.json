    "intro": "Drosera regia, commonly known as the giant sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and numerous glandular hairs that secrete a sticky digestive fluid. The plant's leaves are typically arranged in a rosette and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. Drosera regia thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in swampy areas. Its unique botanical features make it a fascinating subject for both horticultural enthusiasts and scientific study."
