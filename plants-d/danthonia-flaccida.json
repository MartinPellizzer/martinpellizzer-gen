    "intro": "Danthonia flaccida, commonly known as the drooping grass or slender danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, flat leaves that often curl at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically arranged in a panicle inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
