    "intro": "Dryopteris repens, commonly known as the running fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread horizontally across the ground. The plant produces delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically evergreen, with a light green color and a slightly hairy texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris repens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
