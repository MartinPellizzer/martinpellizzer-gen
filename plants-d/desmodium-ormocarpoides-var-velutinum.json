    "intro": "Desmodium ormocarpoides var. velutinum, commonly known as velvetleaf desmodium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and allelopathic properties, it can become a weed in cultivated landscapes."
