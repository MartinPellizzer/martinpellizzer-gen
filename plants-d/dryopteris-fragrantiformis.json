    "intro": "Dryopteris fragrantiformis, commonly known as the fragrant wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups. The fragrant aroma of the fronds is a distinctive feature of this species."
