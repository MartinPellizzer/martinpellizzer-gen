    "intro": "Dryas octopetala subsp. hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's dryas, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces white or pale pink flowers in clusters of eight, giving it the species name \"octopetala.\" The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high elevations. This subspecies is particularly adapted to harsh climatic conditions and plays an important role in alpine ecosystems."
