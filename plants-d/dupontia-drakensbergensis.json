    "intro": "Dupontia drakensbergensis, commonly known as the Drakensberg grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Drakensberg mountain range in southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. Dupontia drakensbergensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
