    "intro": "Deschampsia andicola, commonly known as the Andean hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like foliage and often grows in high-altitude environments. This plant is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
