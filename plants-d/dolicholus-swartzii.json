    "intro": "Dolicholus swartzii, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant has small, green leaves and produces yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated but is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
