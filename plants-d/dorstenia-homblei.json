    "intro": "Dorstenia homblei, commonly known as the \"Bottle Tree,\" is a unique member of the Moraceae family, native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stem that stores water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, often appearing after rainfall. Its leaves are typically spirally arranged and can be either simple or compound, depending on the growth conditions. Dorstenia homblei is also known for its ability to form a caudex, which contributes to its distinctive appearance and resilience."
