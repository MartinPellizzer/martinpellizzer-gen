    "intro": "Dendrobium pseudotokai, commonly known as the Tokai orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a thick, cane-like stem that stores water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium pseudotokai is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
