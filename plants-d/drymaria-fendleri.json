    "intro": "Drymaria fendleri, commonly known as desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Drymaria fendleri is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
