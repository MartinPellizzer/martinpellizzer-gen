    "intro": "Draba nipponica f. ramosa, commonly known as the Japanese rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It typically features small, basal leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it well-suited for rock gardens. The variety 'ramosa' is distinguished by its more branched stems compared to the typical form."
