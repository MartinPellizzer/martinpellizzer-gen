    "intro": "Duranta arida subsp. serpentina, commonly known as the desert trumpetvine, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branching stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, depending on the season. These flowers are adapted for pollination by birds and insects, particularly hummingbirds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping in dry climates."
