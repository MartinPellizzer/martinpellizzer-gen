    "intro": "Diplazium chlorophyllum, commonly known as the green chain fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, long, creeping rhizomes that form dense mats. The plant has bipinnate fronds with a bright green color, which contribute to its ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
