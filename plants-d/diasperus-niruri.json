    "intro": "Diasperus niruri, commonly known as the creeping dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true roots and chlorophyll. It attaches itself to host plants, drawing nutrients and water through specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas easily. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
