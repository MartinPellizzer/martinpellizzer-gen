    "intro": "Derris araripensis, commonly known as the Brazilian snakeweed, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Leguminosae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is notable for containing the alkaloid rotenone, which has been used in traditional fishing practices. However, due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated or used in modern agriculture."
