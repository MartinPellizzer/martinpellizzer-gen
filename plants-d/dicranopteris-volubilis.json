    "intro": "Dicranopteris volubilis, commonly known as the climbing water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense mats, allowing it to spread easily. Dicranopteris volubilis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid conditions."
