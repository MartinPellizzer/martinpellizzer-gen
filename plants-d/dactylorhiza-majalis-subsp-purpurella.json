    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis subsp. purpurella, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and northern Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of purple or pink flowers. The plant has a pseudobulbous structure, with fleshy, swollen stems that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are linear and arranged in two rows, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and light conditions."
