    "intro": "Draba gilliesii var. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous whitlow grass, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. The plant has a creeping growth habit, with stolons that allow it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in fine hairs, adapting to harsh alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high elevations."
