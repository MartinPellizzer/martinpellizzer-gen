    "intro": "Dactylorhynchus flavescens, commonly known as the golden-leafed orchid, is a rare and endangered terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow-green leaves and small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and swampy areas. It has a complex root system that often forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is highly threatened in the wild."
