    "intro": "Dorstenia belizensis, commonly known as the Belize starfruit, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, while its fruit resembles a small, fleshy berry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dorstenia belizensis is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
