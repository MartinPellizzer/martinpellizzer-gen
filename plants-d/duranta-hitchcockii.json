    "intro": "Duranta hitchcockii, commonly known as the silverleaf duranta, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking clusters of tubular, blue-violet flowers that appear throughout the growing season. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Duranta hitchcockii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
