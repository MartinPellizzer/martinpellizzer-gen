    "intro": "Disporum sessile f. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved false lily of the valley, is a variant of the disporum species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are significantly larger than those of the typical species. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage and floral structure make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in its natural habitat."
