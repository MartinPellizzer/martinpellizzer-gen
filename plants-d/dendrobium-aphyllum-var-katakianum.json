    "intro": "Dendrobium aphyllum var. katakianum, commonly known as the Katakianum orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features long, cane-like stems that produce clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with intricate patterns. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to conserve water in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and unique beauty, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
