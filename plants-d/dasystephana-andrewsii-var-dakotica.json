    "intro": "Dasystephana andrewsii var. dakotica, commonly known as the Dakota stephania, is a rare flowering plant native to the grasslands of the Great Plains. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15\u201330 centimeters and prefers well-drained soil and full sun. It is often found in open habitats such as prairies and along roadsides. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions and is protected in some states."
