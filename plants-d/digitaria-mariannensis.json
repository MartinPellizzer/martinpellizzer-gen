    "intro": "Digitaria mariannensis, commonly known as the Mariana grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Digitaria mariannensis is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
