It is a biennial plant characterized by its taproot, which is typically smaller and less fleshy compared to the common carrot. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped umbel, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive silvery underside. This subspecies is adapted to the arid and volcanic soils of its native habitat, showing resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
