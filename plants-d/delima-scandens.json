It is a woody vine that can grow up to several meters in length, often climbing trees or shrubs for support. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Delima scandens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
