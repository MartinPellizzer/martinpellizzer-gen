    "intro": "Dryopteris aurantiaca, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, reddish-brown fiddleheads that unfurl into long, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent, meaning they emit a faint glow in the dark, which aids in spore dispersal. The cinnamon fern plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
