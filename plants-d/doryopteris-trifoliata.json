    "intro": "Doryopteris trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate (three-lobed) fronds, which are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to humid, tropical gardens."
