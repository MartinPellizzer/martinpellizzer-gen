    "intro": "Duval-jouvea maritima, commonly known as the coastal dune grass, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion along shorelines. This hardy species is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to dune formation."
