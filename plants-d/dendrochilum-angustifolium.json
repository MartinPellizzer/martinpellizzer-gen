    "intro": "Dendrochilum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tree orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, appressed hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
