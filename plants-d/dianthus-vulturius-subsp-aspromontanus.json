    "intro": "Dianthus vulturius subsp. aspromontanus, commonly known as the Aspromontan campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its pink to reddish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
