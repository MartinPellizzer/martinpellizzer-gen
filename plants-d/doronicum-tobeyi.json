    "intro": "Doronicum tobeyi, commonly known as the alpine goldbell, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and clusters of bright yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones, where it contributes to the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
