    "intro": "Damnacanthus indicus f. microphyllus, commonly known as the dwarf devil's backbone, is a compact, low-growing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of the typical species, giving it a more delicate appearance. The plant produces striking, red-orange flowers with long, slender bracts that resemble a spine, hence its common name. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique addition to tropical and subtropical gardens."
