    "intro": "Doryopteris phanerophlebia, commonly known as the broad-veined wood fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds and vascular structure. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant features large, compound fronds with prominent, well-defined veins that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Its rhizomes are thick and often covered in a layer of spongy tissue, which helps in water retention. Doryopteris phanerophlebia is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes."
