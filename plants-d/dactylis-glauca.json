    "intro": "Dactylis glauca, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for pasture and erosion control. Dactylis glauca is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, hardy lawns."
