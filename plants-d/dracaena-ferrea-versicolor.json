    "intro": "Dracaena ferrea versicolor, commonly known as the red-leaf dracaena, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, variegated foliage, featuring deep red, orange, and green hues on its lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red or orange berries, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena ferrea versicolor is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ability to purify the air and adapt to various environmental conditions."
