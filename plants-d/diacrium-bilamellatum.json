    "intro": "Diacrium bilamellatum, commonly known as the two-lipped rock orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, bilaterally symmetrical flowers with two prominent lips. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features include slender stems and small, delicate leaves, which help it adapt to its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Diacrium bilamellatum is considered a species of conservation concern."
