It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid environments. Dischidia formosana is also notable for its ability to form aerial roots, which help it attach to trees and absorb moisture from the air."
