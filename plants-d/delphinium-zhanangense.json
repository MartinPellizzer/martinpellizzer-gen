    "intro": "Delphinium zhanangense, commonly known as the Tibetan larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features showy blue to purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture that helps it withstand the harsh mountain climate. Delphinium zhanangense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
