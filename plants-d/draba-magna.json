    "intro": "Draba magna, commonly known as the giant whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Draba magna thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to protect against harsh weather conditions."
