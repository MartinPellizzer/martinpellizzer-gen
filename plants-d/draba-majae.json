    "intro": "Draba majae, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a small flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cold, harsh environments. Draba majae produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in extreme mountain conditions."
