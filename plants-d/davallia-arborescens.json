    "intro": "Davallia arborescens, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, lance-shaped fronds. The plant has a unique structure with a central stem covered in a thick, fibrous layer. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its growth is slow, making it a long-lived plant. Davallia arborescens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
