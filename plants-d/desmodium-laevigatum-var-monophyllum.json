It features trifoliate leaves with narrow, elliptical leaflets and small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, round pods containing several seeds. It is often used in agroforestry and as a forage plant due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and tolerance to drought. Its botanical characteristics make it adaptable to various soil types and climates."
