    "intro": "Dendrochilum lancilabium, commonly known as the long-labied tree orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped labellum, which gives it its specific epithet. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its roots while deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with a distinctive three-lobed structure. Dendrochilum lancilabium is known for its ability to thrive in humid, tropical environments with indirect light."
