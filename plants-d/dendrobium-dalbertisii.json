    "intro": "Dendrobium dalbertisii, commonly known as the Chinese orchid or the Dalbert's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length, and it produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its flowers are typically borne along the stems and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation. Dendrobium dalbertisii is known for its adaptability to various growing conditions, which contributes to its widespread cultivation in gardens and greenhouses."
