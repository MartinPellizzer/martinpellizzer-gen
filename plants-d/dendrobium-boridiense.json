    "intro": "Dendrobium boridiense, commonly known as the Boridiense orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its clustered, cane-like pseudobulbs and long, linear leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the dry season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
