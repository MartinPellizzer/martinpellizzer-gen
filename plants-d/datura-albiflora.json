    "intro": "Datura albiflora, commonly known as white angel's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a woody stem and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy in texture. It produces toxic berries that contain tropane alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Datura albiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value but requires careful handling due to its poisonous properties."
