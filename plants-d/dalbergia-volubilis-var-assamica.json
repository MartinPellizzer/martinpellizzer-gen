It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, round, dark purple to black seeds enclosed in a pod. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
