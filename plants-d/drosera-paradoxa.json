    "intro": "Drosera paradoxa, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of hairless, waxy leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The leaves are covered in sticky glands that secrete a sweet, nectar-like substance to attract insects. Unlike many other Drosera species, it does not produce a showy flower, instead having small, inconspicuous blooms. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires high humidity and bright light to flourish."
