It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and wetlands. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that form dense tussocks, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers. Deyeuxia vicunarum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
