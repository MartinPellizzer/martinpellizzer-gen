    "intro": "Diuris brumalis, commonly known as the Christmas orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces striking, spider-like flowers that are usually pale yellow or greenish with red or brown markings. It blooms during late summer to early autumn, often around December, hence its common name. Diuris brumalis is a short-lived perennial, with its life cycle closely tied to seasonal rainfall patterns."
