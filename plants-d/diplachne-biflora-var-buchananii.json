    "intro": "Diplachne biflora var. buchananii, commonly known as the narrowleaf beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Australia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. It is often found in regions with low rainfall and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
