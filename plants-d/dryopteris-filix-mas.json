    "intro": "Dryopteris filix-mas, commonly known as the male fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fleshy, dark brown rhizomes that store nutrients and water. Its spores are produced in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. The male fern is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
