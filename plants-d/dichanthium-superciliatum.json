    "intro": "Dichanthium superciliatum, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often have a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two bract-like structures at the base of each spikelet. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Dichanthium superciliatum is often found in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline."
