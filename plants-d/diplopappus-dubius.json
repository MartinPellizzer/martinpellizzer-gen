    "intro": "Diplopappus dubius, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its fruit is a two-seeded achene enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and can withstand periods of drought."
