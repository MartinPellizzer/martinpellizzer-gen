    "intro": "Davallia muelleri, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Australia. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and leathery, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Davallia muelleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
