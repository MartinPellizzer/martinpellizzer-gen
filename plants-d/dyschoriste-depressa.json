    "intro": "Dyschoriste depressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dyschoriste, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in terminal spikes and bloom during the rainy season. Dyschoriste depressa is notable for its ability to thrive in wetland environments and is often used in traditional medicine."
