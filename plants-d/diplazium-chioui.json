    "intro": "Diplazium chioui, commonly known as the golden chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, cascading fronds that resemble a chain of golden leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that give it a lush, ornamental appearance. Diplazium chioui is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in horticulture and is valued for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
