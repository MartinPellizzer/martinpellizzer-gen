    "intro": "Daphne acuminata var. kochii, commonly known as the Koch's daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value comes from its showy blooms and attractive foliage throughout the growing season."
