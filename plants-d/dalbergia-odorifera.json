    "intro": "Dalbergia odorifera, commonly known as the Chinese rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly China, Vietnam, and Cambodia. It is characterized by its dense, dark brown to black heartwood, which is highly valued for its rich scent and fine grain. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental and medicinal properties. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species."
