    "intro": "Dryopteris ochrorachis, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of polypod fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The golden shield fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
