    "intro": "Dryopteris tricellularis, commonly known as the three-celled wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles the structure of a fern's vascular system. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The three-celled structure of its spores is a unique botanical feature that aids in its identification and ecological adaptation."
