It is a member of the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, oval-shaped berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Diomedes thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a notable species in its native habitat."
