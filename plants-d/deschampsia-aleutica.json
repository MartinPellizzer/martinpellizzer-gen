    "intro": "Deschampsia aleutica, commonly known as Aleutian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in tundra and alpine environments. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 stems that produce feathery plumes of light green to silver-blue flowers in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered with a fine layer of hairs. Deschampsia aleutica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native habitats."
