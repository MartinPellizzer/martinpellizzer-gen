    "intro": "Dryopteris intermedia subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate wood fern, is a fern species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland habitats."
