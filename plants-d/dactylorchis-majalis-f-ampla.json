    "intro": "Dactylorchis majalis f. ampla, commonly known as the broad-leafed twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, fleshy rhizome and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often more pronounced than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and requires specific soil conditions for successful growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
