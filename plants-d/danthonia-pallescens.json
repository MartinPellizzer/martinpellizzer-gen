    "intro": "Danthonia pallescens, commonly known as the gray muhly, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers in summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in coastal and inland dune ecosystems. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it both ecologically and aesthetically significant."
