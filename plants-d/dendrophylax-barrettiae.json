    "intro": "Dendrophylax barrettiae, commonly known as the Barrett's orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are usually pale yellow to white in color, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
