    "intro": "Diplotaxis virgata f. hispida, commonly known as the hairy diplotaxis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual with erect, branched stems covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
