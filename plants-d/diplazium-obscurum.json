    "intro": "Diplazium obscurum, commonly known as the dark fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Diplazium obscurum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
