    "intro": "Davallia boryana, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Davallia boryana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
