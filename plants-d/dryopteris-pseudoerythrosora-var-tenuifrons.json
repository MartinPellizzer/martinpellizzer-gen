    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudoerythrosora var. tenuifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a variant of the false holly fern. It is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly China and Japan. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long, with a pale green to reddish-brown coloration on the underside. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
