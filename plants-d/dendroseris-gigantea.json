    "intro": "Dendroseris gigantea, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a towering fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a thick, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-draining soil. Dendroseris gigantea plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various small organisms."
