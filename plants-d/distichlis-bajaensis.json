    "intro": "Distichlis bajaensis, commonly known as the desert spoon, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy and saline soils, often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts. The plant features long, narrow leaves with a distinctive spoon-shaped tip, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or pale blue in color. Distichlis bajaensis is well adapted to extreme drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
