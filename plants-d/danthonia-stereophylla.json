    "intro": "Danthonia stereophylla, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
