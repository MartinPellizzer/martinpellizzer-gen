    "intro": "Dacrydium falciforme, commonly known as the New Zealand silver pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its slender, tall trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are typically needle-like, arranged in spirals along the stems, and are often covered with a waxy cuticle. It produces both male and female cones, with the female cones maturing into woody, spiky structures that release seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in M\u0101ori culture."
