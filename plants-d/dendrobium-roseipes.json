    "intro": "Dendrobium roseipes, commonly known as the rose-lip orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple stems that produce showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has fleshy, strap-like leaves that help store water, adapting to its humid, shaded forest habitat. Its flowers are often clustered in racemes and bloom during the warmer months. Dendrobium roseipes is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique floral structure."
