    "intro": "Daucus gadecaei, commonly known as the Gadecean carrot, is a rare flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its root system is less developed compared to typical carrots, and it is adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered an important species for botanical study."
