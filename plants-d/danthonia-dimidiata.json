    "intro": "Danthonia dimidiata, commonly known as the narrowleaf danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and coastal areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Danthonia dimidiata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its role in native plant communities."
