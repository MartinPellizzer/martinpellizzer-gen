    "intro": "Drosera sanariapoana, commonly known as the Sanariapoana Sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It belongs to the Droseraceae family and is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap small insects. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, boggy environments where it supplements its diet with captured prey. Its leaves are rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of mucilage, which aids in insect adhesion. Drosera sanariapoana is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
