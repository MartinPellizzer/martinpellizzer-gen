    "intro": "Drosanthemum sessile, commonly known as the cushion daisy, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for coastal and Mediterranean climates."
