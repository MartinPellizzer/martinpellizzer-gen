    "intro": "Dupatya saxatilis, commonly known as the rock hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or along shorelines. Its ability to withstand saline and wind conditions makes it well adapted to coastal environments. Dupatya saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical regions."
