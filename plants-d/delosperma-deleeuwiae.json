    "intro": "Delosperma deleeuwiae, commonly known as the De Leeuw's ice plant, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an attractive and low-maintenance ornamental plant."
