The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Dactylorchis cruenta is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its ornamental value and ecological significance in its native range."
