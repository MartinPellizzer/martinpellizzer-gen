    "intro": "Dichanthelium olivaceum, commonly known as the olive panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial plant characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to golden spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinct midrib, and it thrives in moist to wet environments such as marshes and swamps. Dichanthelium olivaceum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
