    "intro": "Dioscorea tamshiyacuensis, commonly known as the Tamshiyacu yam, is a climbing vine native to the Amazon rainforest of Peru. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, green flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its habitat is primarily in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable but rare species in the region."
