    "intro": "Didiscus procumbens, commonly known as the creeping didiscus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
