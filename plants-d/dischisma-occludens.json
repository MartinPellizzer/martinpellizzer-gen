    "intro": "Dischisma occludens, commonly known as the desert star or ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped, white to pinkish flowers. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Dischisma occludens is often found in rocky crevices and sandy soils, adapting well to harsh desert conditions."
