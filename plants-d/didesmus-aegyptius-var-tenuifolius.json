    "intro": "Didesmus aegyptius var. tenuifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Egyptian thorn, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are typically armed with spines, providing protection from herbivores. This species is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often used in traditional medicine."
