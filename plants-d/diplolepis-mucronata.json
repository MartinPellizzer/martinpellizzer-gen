    "intro": "Diplolepis mucronata, commonly known as the common blackberry bush, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into dark purple or black berries. These berries are often consumed by birds and mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. Its botanical features make it an important component of hedgerows and woodland edges."
