    "intro": "Daphne laureola proles philippi, commonly known as the Philippi's laurel daphne, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, appearing in clusters during late winter to early spring. The plant has smooth, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and emit a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or borders. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant are poisonous to humans and animals."
