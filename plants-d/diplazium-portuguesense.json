    "intro": "Diplazium portuguesense, commonly known as Portuguese water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, aiding in its reproductive cycle."
