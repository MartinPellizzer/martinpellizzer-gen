    "intro": "Diplazium plantagineum, commonly known as the common wood sorrel, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being heart-shaped with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spadices, typical of the fern family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Diplazium plantagineum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats that can dominate ground cover in suitable habitats."
