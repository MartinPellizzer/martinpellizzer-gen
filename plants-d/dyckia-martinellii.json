    "intro": "Dyckia martinellii, commonly known as the Martinelli's Dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear bright orange or red flowers, which are showy and attract pollinators. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dyckia martinellii is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance."
