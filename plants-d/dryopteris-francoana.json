    "intro": "Dryopteris francoana, commonly known as the French shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are covered in small, rounded structures called sori."
