    "intro": "Drosace albertina, commonly known as the Albertina's drosace, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, violet-pink petals. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of soft, white\u7ed2\u6bdb, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Drosace albertina is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
