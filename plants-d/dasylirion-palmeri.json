    "intro": "Dasylirion palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's century plant, is a striking perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of long, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, blue-gray coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears numerous white to pale purple flowers, typically blooming only once in its lifetime. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscapic gardens."
