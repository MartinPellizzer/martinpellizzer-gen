    "intro": "Disa baurii, commonly known as the pink disa, is a striking member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Disa baurii is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
