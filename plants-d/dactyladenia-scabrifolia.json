It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and alternate leaves with a rough, scabrous texture. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Its fruits are capsules that release tiny seeds upon maturity. Dactyladenia scabrifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and thickets."
