    "intro": "Draba aizoides f. turgida, commonly known as the swollen rock-cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This subspecies is notable for its swollen, fleshy stems, which help it store water in harsh, arid conditions."
