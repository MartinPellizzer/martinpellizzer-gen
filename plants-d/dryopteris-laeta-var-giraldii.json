    "intro": "Dryopteris laeta var. giraldii, commonly known as the Giraldii maidenhair fern, is a variant of the delicate maidenhair fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are often adorned with a faint silvery hue along the veins. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense, low-growing mats. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
