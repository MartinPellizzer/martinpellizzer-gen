    "intro": "Daucus glochidiatus, commonly known as the prickly burr parsley, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, dry, and covered in hooked spines, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Daucus glochidiatus is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
