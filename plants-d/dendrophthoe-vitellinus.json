    "intro": "Dendrophthoe vitellinus, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant forms a dense, tangled mass of stems and leaves that can significantly weaken the host tree over time. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, yellowish-white flowers are followed by red, fleshy berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals."
