    "intro": "Draba parryi, commonly known as Parry's whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and basal leaves. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats to conserve moisture and withstand harsh conditions. Draba parryi is adapted to cold climates and can survive in poor soil, making it a hardy member of its ecosystem. Its flowers, which bloom in early spring, are white or pale yellow and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
