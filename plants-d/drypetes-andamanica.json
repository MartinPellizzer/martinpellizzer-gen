It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems.
