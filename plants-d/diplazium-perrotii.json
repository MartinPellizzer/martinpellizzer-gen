    "intro": "Diplazium perrotii, commonly known as the golden spider-ferns, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright yellow fronds that contrast sharply with its dark green rachises. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with lanceolate pinnae that are often curled when young. Diplazium perrotii is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine."
