    "intro": "Delphinium calcar-equitis, commonly known as the rock spirea delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like flower clusters. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a hairy underside and produces striking blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
