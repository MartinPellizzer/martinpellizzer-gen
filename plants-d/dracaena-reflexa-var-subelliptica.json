It features striking, dark green, strap-like leaves that curve downward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is known for its adaptability to low-light conditions and is often used as an indoor ornamental plant. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries, though it is not typically cultivated for fruit. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for indoor spaces where space is limited."
