    "intro": "Didymocarpus serratifolius, commonly known as the serrated-leaved didymocarp, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, serrated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by fruits that are fleshy and red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
