    "intro": "Drimia zambesiaca, commonly known as the Zambesi lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a rhizomatous stem system that allows it to spread and form dense clumps. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive yellow throat. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and often have a waxy coating. Drimia zambesiaca is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks."
