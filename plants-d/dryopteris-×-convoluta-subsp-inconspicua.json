It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with dark brown, hairy stems. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a subtle, inconspicuous appearance that gives it its subspecies name. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
