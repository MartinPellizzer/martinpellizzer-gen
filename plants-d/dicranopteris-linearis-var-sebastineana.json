    "intro": "Dicranopteris linearis var. sebastineana, commonly known as the Sebastinean water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its finely divided, linear fronds. It is a perennial aquatic plant that thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments. The fronds are typically narrow and elongated, with a delicate, feathery appearance. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. This plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, contributing to aquatic ecosystem stability."
