    "intro": "Dracaena phanerophlebia, commonly known as the broad-leafed dracaena, is a member of the Asparagaceae family native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are a key feature in its reproductive cycle. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to bright indirect light for optimal growth. Dracaena phanerophlebia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
