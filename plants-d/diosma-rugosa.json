    "intro": "Diosma rugosa, commonly known as the rough diosma, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces elliptical, yellowish-orange berries that are edible but have a mild, tangy flavor. Diosma rugosa thrives in arid to semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
