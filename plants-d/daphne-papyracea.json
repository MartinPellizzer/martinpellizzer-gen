    "intro": "Daphne papyracea, commonly known as the paperleaf daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, almost papery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it thrives in partial shade to full sun, preferring well-drained soil. Daphne papyracea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its early spring blooms and unique foliage."
