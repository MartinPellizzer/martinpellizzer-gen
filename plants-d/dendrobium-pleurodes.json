It is characterized by its erect, branching stems that bear numerous lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
