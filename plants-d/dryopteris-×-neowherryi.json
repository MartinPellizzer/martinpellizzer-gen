    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 neowherryi, commonly known as the Neowherry's shield fern, is a hybrid fern that results from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octopleura. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are typically found in the upper part of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
