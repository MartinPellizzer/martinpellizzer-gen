    "intro": "Dianthus inclusus, commonly known as the rock campion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in rocky or coastal environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Dianthus inclusus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
