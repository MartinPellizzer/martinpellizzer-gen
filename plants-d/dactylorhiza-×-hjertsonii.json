    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 hjertsonii, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dactylorhiza maculata and Dactylorhiza viridiflora. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and marshes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. It produces tall, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves and bears clusters of greenish-yellow to brownish flowers. The species is characterized by its unique floral structure and is often found in association with other orchid species in its native range."
