    "intro": "Dendrobium niveum, commonly known as the white-lipped dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length, often adorned with clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Dendrobium niveum is prized in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
