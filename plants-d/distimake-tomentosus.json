    "intro": "Distimake tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly coating that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange and serve as a food source for birds and other animals. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
