    "intro": "Danthonia craigii, commonly known as Craig's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many areas."
