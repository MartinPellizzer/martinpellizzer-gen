    "intro": "Dipsacus cephalarioides, commonly known as the spiked centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that are elongated and covered in stiff bristles, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight hairy texture. Dipsacus cephalarioides is typically found in dry, rocky soils and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value."
