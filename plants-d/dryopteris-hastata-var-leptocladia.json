    "intro": "Dryopteris hastata var. leptocladia, commonly known as the narrow-clad fern, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, loamy soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
