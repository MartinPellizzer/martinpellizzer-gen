    "intro": "Dendrobium crassicaule, commonly known as the thick-stemmed orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with red or purple markings. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted for efficient water absorption. Dendrobium crassicaule is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
