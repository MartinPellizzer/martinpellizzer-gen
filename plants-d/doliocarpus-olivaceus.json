    "intro": "Doliocarpus olivaceus, commonly known as the olive sycamore, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, round, olive-green fruits that are edible but have a bitter taste. Its botanical features make it an important species in its native ecosystems, though it is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes."
