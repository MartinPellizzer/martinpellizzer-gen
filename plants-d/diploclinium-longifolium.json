    "intro": "Diploclinium longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved diploclinium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its fibrous roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its ecological role in its native habitat remains understudied. The species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth."
