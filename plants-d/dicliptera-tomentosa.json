    "intro": "Dicliptera tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly dicliptera, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape and have a rough texture. Dicliptera tomentosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks."
