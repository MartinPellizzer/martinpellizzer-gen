    "intro": "Dichapetalum dewildei, commonly known as the Cape snowball, is a striking shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble snowballs, blooming in winter. The plant has smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are aromatic when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
