    "intro": "Dalbergia paniculata, commonly known as the pinkwood or pink tree, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often branched trunk and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or red in color, arranged in panicles, giving it its scientific name. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, though it is less commonly used than other Dalbergia species. The plant also has a role in traditional medicine and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
