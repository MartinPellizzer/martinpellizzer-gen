    "intro": "Deyeuxia purpurea, commonly known as purple false rice, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often pink or purple in hue, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Deyeuxia purpurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
