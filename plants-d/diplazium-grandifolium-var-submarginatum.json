    "intro": "Diplazium grandifolium var. submarginatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The leaves have a distinctive margin that is slightly serrated or wavy, contributing to its unique appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying aquatic plant adaptations and ecological dynamics."
