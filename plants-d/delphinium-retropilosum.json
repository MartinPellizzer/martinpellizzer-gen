    "intro": "Delphinium retropilosum, commonly known as the backward-hairy larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features showy blue to purple flowers arranged in dense racemes, with five petals and prominent spurred sepals. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated margins, and are covered in fine, backward-curving hairs, giving it its common name. Delphinium retropilosum is adapted to alpine environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
