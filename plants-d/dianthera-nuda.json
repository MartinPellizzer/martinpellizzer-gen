It is native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. The plant is characterized by its simple, hairy stems and small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native habitat."
