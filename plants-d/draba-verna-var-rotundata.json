    "intro": "Draba verna var. rotundata, commonly known as the spring whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a basal rosette of smooth, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, elongated inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its compact growth form and early blooming period make it an important early-season nectar source for pollinators."
