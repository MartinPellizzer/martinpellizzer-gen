    "intro": "Daphniphyllum obtusifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
