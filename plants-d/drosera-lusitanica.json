    "intro": "Drosera lusitanica, commonly known as the Portuguese Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sugary substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in bogs or heathlands. Its leaves are rosette-shaped and can vary in size depending on environmental conditions. Drosera lusitanica is known for its ability to digest trapped prey, providing essential nutrients in its nutrient-deficient habitat."
