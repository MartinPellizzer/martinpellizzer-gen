    "intro": "Distichlis scoparia, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. The plant is highly adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable component of coastal dune stabilization. Its ability to thrive in harsh environments contributes to its role in ecological restoration projects. Distichlis scoparia is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
