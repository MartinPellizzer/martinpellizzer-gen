    "intro": "Diplocaulobium hydrophilum var. morotaiense, commonly known as the Morotai water fern, is a aquatic fern native to the island of Morotai in Indonesia. It thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that float on the water surface, with roots extending into the water. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of clean, unpolluted water."
