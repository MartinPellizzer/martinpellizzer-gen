    "intro": "Dryopteris splendens, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are glossy and often adorned with golden veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in its identification."
