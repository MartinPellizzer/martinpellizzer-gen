It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its clustered, small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
