It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix and a spathe. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its rhizomes are edible and have a starchy texture similar to taro. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
