    "intro": "Diospyros eucalyptifolia, commonly known as the eucalyptus persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, orange to reddish fruits resembling persimmons. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in lowland areas with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
