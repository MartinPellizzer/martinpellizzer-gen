    "intro": "Diodia multiflora, commonly known as silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its small, white or violet flowers and hairy, silver-green leaves. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and peppers. Diodia multiflora typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas. It is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
