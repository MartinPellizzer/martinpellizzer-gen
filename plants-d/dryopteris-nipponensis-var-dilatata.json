    "intro": "Dryopteris nipponensis var. dilatata, commonly known as the Japanese wood fern, is a species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds. This variant is distinguished by its elongated, spreading fronds and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
