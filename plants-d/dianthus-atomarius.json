    "intro": "Dianthus atomarius, commonly known as the sand catchpole, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers with a distinctive, frilled appearance. It blooms from late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to rocky or coastal landscapes. Dianthus atomarius is often used in rock gardens and is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments."
