    "intro": "Dryopteris okinawensis, commonly known as the Okinawa wood fern, is a rare fern species native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are grouped in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
