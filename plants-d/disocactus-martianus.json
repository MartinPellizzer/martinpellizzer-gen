    "intro": "Disocactus martianus, commonly known as the Martian cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height, often adorned with spiny areoles. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to extreme desert conditions. Despite its dramatic appearance, it is a slow-growing plant that requires minimal care once established."
