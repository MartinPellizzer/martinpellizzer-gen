    "intro": "Drynaria rubida, commonly known as the red fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green with a reddish hue on the underside. The plant grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, often found on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself and absorb moisture from the air. The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate-shaped pinnae that contribute to its distinctive appearance."
