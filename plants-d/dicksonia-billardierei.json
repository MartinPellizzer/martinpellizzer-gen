    "intro": "Dicksonia billardierei, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. The plant produces large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
