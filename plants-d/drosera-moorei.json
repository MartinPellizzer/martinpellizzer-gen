    "intro": "Drosera moorei, commonly known as the Moore's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sugary substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are usually small and clustered at the base, forming a rosette shape. Drosera moorei is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its nutrients through insect prey."
