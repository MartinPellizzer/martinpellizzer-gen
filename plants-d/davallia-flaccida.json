    "intro": "Davallia flaccida, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, arching fronds. It is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and India, and thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant features small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Its rhizomes are wiry and often grow horizontally, allowing the plant to spread gradually. Davallia flaccida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
