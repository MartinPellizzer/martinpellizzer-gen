    "intro": "Didiscus saniculifolius var. novoguinensis, commonly known as the New Guinea didiscus, is a member of the Violaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to variegated patterns. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and as a houseplant."
