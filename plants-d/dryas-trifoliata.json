    "intro": "Dryas trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leafed mountain avens, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, often found in rocky and barren soils. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Dryas trifoliata is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
