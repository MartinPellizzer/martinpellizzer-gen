    "intro": "Dendrobium conanthum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Dendrobium conanthum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
