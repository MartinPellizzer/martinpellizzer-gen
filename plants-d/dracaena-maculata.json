    "intro": "Dracaena maculata, commonly known as the Variegated Dracaena, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow leaves with striking variegation of white, yellow, and green patterns. The plant has a sturdy, upright stem that can grow up to several feet in height. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena maculata is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
