    "intro": "Digitaria concinna, commonly known as slender digitgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open areas, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its resilience to drought. Digitaria concinna is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and soil-stabilizing properties."
