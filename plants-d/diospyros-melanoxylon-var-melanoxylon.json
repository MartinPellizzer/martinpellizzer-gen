    "intro": "Diospyros melanoxylon var. melanoxylon, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The tree typically grows as a small to medium-sized deciduous tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy green upper surface with a pale underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans."
