    "intro": "Drosera humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Droseraceae family and is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and fens. Its leaves are usually small and clustered, with a rosette structure that helps retain moisture. Drosera humbertii is known for its ability to digest trapped prey, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils."
