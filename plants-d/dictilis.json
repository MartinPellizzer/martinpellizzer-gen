    "intro": "Dictilis, commonly known as the silky oat or silky grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. These plants are native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Dictilis species are characterized by their fine, silky hairs that cover the leaves and stems, giving them a distinctive appearance. They typically produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in panicles. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, some of which are used in ornamental horticulture for their unique foliage."
