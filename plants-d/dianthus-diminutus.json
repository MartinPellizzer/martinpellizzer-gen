    "intro": "Dianthus diminutus, commonly known as the dwarf pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant produces showy, double-petaled blooms that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Dianthus diminutus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
