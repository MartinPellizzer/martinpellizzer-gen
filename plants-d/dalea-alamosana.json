    "intro": "Dalea alamosana, commonly known as the Alamosa milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pink to purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has small, compound leaves that help reduce water loss. Dalea alamosana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
