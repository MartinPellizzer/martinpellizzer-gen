    "intro": "Dryopteris pubescens var. sericea, commonly known as the silky wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely hairy fronds that give it a soft, silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, delicate structure that contributes to its ornamental value. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
