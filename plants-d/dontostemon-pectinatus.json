    "intro": "Dontostemon pectinatus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered an invasive species in many areas."
