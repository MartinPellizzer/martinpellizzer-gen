    "intro": "Diplotaxis auriculata, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like mustard and cabbage. The plant features basal leaves that are lobed and have a distinctive auriculate (ear-like) base, giving it its scientific name. It produces yellow flowers in racemose inflorescences, followed by small, hairy, capsule-like fruits. Diplotaxis auriculata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
