    "intro": "Dryopteris arisanensis, commonly known as the Arisan wood fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
