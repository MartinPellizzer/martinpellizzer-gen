    "intro": "Duosperma transvaalense, commonly known as the Transvaal ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
