    "intro": "Diplotaxis, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to southern Africa. These plants typically have basal rosettes of leaves and produce small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads. The leaves are usually hairy and have a distinctive, slightly bitter taste. Diplotaxis species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments and are adapted to thrive in poor soils."
