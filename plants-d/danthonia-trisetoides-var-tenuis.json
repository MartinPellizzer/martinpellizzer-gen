    "intro": "Danthonia trisetoides var. tenuis, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are often covered in short, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
