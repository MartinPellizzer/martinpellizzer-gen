    "intro": "Dichromena cariciformis, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It thrives in saline environments, often found in mangrove swamps and estuaries. The plant has dark, woody stems and produces small, white flowers that are followed by clustered, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Dichromena cariciformis plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
