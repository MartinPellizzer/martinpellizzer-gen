    "intro": "Dalea carnescens, commonly known as scarlet prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bright red or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain its seeds. Dalea carnescens plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often used in native plant restoration projects."
