    "intro": "Dryopteris eugenii, commonly known as the Eugen's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Dryopteris eugenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and light conditions."
