    "intro": "Diplazium simile, commonly known as the common sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
