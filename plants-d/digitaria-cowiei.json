    "intro": "Digitaria cowiei, commonly known as the coastal wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often found in dune environments and coastal plains. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Digitaria cowiei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
