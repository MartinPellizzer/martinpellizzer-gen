    "intro": "Dactylorchis incarnata var. lobelii, commonly known as the Lobel's pink orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems and produces showy, pinkish-purple flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and swampy areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
