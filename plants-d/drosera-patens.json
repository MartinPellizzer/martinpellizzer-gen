    "intro": "Drosera patens, commonly known as the common sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, sticky leaves that secrete a digestive enzyme to trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or reddish in color. Drosera patens is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense mats in its natural habitat."
