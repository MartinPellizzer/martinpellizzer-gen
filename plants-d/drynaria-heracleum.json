    "intro": "Drynaria heracleum, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial plant that forms a tall, slender trunk with a crown of feathery fronds. The plant has a unique structure with a central axis covered in a thick, fibrous layer called the rhyzome. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of branching, giving it a lush, fern-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
