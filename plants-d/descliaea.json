    "intro": "Descliaea, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often grow on rocky surfaces or in crevices. The plants typically have a pseudobulb structure, which helps store water and nutrients in arid environments. Descliaea species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Australia. Their unique morphology and habitat preferences make them popular among orchid enthusiasts and botanists."
