    "intro": "Delphinium fissum var. leiocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-seeded larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless seed pods, which set it apart from other delphinium species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
