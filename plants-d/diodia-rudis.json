    "intro": "Diodia rudis, commonly known as coastal blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. Diodia rudis is often found in dune ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and supporting local biodiversity."
