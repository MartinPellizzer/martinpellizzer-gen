    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy cocksfoot, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences that contain small, fluffy seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils due to its adaptability to various environmental conditions. Hairy cocksfoot is valued for its forage quality and is used in agricultural settings as a pasture grass."
