    "intro": "Dalrympelea sphaerocarpa var. microcerotis, commonly known as the dwarf rock heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, dense clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand coastal salt spray and strong winds. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and smaller flowers compared to the typical form of Dalrympelea sphaerocarpa."
