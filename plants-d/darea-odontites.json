It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lobed leaves and a single, hollow, toothed stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family. It produces a distinctive, elongated, and often hairy seed dispersal structure called a pappus. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is native to Europe and parts of Asia."
