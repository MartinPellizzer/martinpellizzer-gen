    "intro": "Dodonaea humifusa, commonly known as the coastal screwbean, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Dodonaea humifusa is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
