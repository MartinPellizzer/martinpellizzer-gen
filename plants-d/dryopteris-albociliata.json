    "intro": "Dryopteris albociliata, commonly known as the white-fringed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered with a fine, white marginal ciliation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
