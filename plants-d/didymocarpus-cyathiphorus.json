    "intro": "Didymocarpus cyathiphorus, commonly known as the horned balsam, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like calyces that encase its small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, often found in moist, disturbed habitats. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, while the flowers are usually pink or red. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds."
