    "intro": "Duranta spinosa, commonly known as the silverleaf duranta, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a silvery-gray pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that transition from blue to purple as they mature. These flowers are followed by bright orange or yellow berries that are an important food source for birds. Duranta spinosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal and tropical environments."
