    "intro": "Dactylorhiza kalopissii subsp. pythagorae, commonly known as the Pythagorean orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive sympodial growth habit, characterized by its fleshy, rhizomatous stems. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers with a complex structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
