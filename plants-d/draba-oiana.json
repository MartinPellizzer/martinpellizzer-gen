    "intro": "Draba oiana, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and Pyrenees, where it thrives in rocky and gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the top of its slender stems. Draba oiana is a perennial herb with a compact growth habit, typically reaching heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh alpine conditions."
