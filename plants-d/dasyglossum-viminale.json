It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in spring and summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Dasyglossum viminale is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
