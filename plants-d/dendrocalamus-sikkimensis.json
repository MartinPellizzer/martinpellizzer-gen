It is native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant has long, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, making it a significant component of the local ecosystem. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and its shoots are edible. This bamboo species plays a vital role in preventing soil erosion and supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
