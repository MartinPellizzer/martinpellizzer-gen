    "intro": "Draba obscura, commonly known as the ghostweed, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Draba obscura is also known for its ability to colonize disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an indicator species of arctic and alpine ecosystems."
