    "intro": "Dryopteris sparsa subsp. viridescens, commonly known as the greenish wood fern, is a fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often a vibrant green, with a slightly serrated edge. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
