It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its succulent leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss."
