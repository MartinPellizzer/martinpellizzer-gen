    "intro": "Drymonia foliacea, commonly known as the leafy drymonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbels. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Drymonia foliacea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
