    "intro": "Digitaria flexilis, commonly known as flexible digitgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically arranged in panicle-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas, roadsides, and disturbed sites. Digitaria flexilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its fine texture and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
