    "intro": "Dryopteris chrysotricha, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow fronds, which are adorned with fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are biennial, with the fiddleheads emerging each spring and unfurling throughout the growing season."
