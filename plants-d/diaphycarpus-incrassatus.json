    "intro": "Diaphycarpus incrassatus, commonly known as the thick-fruit sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its robust, triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female structures, a feature common in many sedges. Diaphycarpus incrassatus is often found in wet or moist habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks."
