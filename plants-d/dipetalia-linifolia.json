    "intro": "Dipetalia linifolia, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its milky sap, which is toxic, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Dipetalia linifolia is often found in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and roadsides."
