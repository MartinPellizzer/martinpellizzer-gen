    "intro": "Dauceria acuta, commonly known as the sharpleaf hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with finely divided, serrated leaves. Its small white or greenish flowers are clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Dauceria acuta is known for its potentially toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and phototoxic reactions upon exposure to sunlight."
