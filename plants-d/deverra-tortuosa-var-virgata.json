    "intro": "Deverra tortuosa var. virgata, commonly known as the spiral banyan, is a unique variant of the banyan tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, twisting aerial roots that form a dense, cascading network above the ground. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy fruits. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to create a dramatic, almost surreal landscape."
