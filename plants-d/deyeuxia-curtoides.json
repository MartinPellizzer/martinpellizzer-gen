    "intro": "Deyeuxia curtoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows. The plant has slender, triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a tight, compact cluster. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. Deyeuxia curtoides plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
