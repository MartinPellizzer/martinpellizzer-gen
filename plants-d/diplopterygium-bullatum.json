    "intro": "Diplopterygium bullatum, commonly known as the bullate diplopterygium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and distinctive, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and sorrel, and is known for its short growth cycle. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
