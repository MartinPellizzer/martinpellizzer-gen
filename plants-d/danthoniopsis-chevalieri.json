    "intro": "Danthoniopsis chevalieri, commonly known as the chevalier's grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
