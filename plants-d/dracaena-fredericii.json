    "intro": "Dracaena fredericii, commonly known as the Frederick's dracaena, is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is native to South Africa. It is a slow-growing, evergreen shrub characterized by its stiff, upright stems and lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in both residential and commercial settings."
