It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, often with a deep green coloration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by elliptical, winged seeds. It thrives in warm, moist environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental foliage, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
