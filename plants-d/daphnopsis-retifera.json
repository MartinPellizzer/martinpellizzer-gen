    "intro": "Daphnopsis retifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved daphnopsis, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Daphniphyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit and distinctive stipules that are often mistaken for leaves. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural habitat."
