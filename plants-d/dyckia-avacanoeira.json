    "intro": "Dyckia avacanoeira, commonly known as the Brazilian pineapple plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
