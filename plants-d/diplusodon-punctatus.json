    "intro": "Diplusodon punctatus, commonly known as the spotted antelope fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are covered with small, rounded spore-producing structures called sori, which are clustered along the undersides. The spotted antelope fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
