    "intro": "Dracaena caulescens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dracaena, is a tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red or orange berries, which are a source of food for birds. Dracaena caulescens is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying properties. Its resilience and aesthetic appeal make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
