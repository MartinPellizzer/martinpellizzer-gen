    "intro": "Dubautia sherffiana var. paucinervia, commonly known as the Kauai ironwood, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, dark green leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow flowers that bloom from November to February. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, coastal climates of Kauai. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
