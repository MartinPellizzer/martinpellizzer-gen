    "intro": "Dissochaeta velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces elliptical, brownish seeds that are dispersed by wind. Dissochaeta velutina is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
