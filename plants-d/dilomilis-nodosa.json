    "intro": "Dilomilis nodosa, commonly known as the clustered dwarf daisy, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Dilomilis nodosa is known for its hardiness and ability to withstand dry conditions."
