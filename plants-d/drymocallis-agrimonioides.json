It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its grayish-white, velvety foliage and bright yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks.

The showy inflorescences attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, making it an important plant in ecological systems."
