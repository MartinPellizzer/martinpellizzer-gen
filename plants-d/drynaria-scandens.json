It is a perennial evergreen fern that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a rhizomatous stem that allows it to climb and spread over other vegetation. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture and a deep green color. Drynaria scandens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
