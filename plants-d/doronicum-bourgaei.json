    "intro": "Doronicum bourgaei, commonly known as the Alpine goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its most striking feature is its clusters of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Doronicum bourgaei is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
