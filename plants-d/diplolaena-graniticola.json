    "intro": "Diplolaena graniticola, commonly known as the granite rock fig, is a flowering plant native to the rocky regions of Western Australia. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually small and succulent, helping it conserve water in its harsh habitat. Diplolaena graniticola is often found growing on granite outcrops, where it forms dense, low-growing mats."
