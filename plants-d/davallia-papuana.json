    "intro": "Davallia papuana, commonly known as the papuan holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific islands. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green with a slightly wavy edge. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or mossy surfaces. Davallia papuana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care."
