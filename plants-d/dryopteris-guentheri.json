    "intro": "Dryopteris guentheri, commonly known as Guenther's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in circinate formations. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
