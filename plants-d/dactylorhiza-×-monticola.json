    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 monticola, commonly known as the Alpine marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic habitats such as peat bogs and damp meadows. It has a complex root system and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
