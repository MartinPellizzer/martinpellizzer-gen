    "intro": "Dendrophthoe elastica, commonly known as the rubber vine, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the stems of other plants, drawing water and nutrients from its host. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Dendrophthoe elastica is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found growing on trees in forested areas."
