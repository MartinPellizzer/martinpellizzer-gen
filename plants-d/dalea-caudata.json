    "intro": "Dalea caudata, commonly known as the longtail milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils, making it well-suited for arid environments. Dalea caudata is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe."
