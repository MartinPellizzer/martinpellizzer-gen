    "intro": "Davallia gaimardiana, commonly known as the silver-veined holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive silvery-white midrib. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine in some cultures. The fronds are typically leathery and can grow up to 1 meter in length, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
