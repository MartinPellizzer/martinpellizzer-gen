    "intro": "Dichanthelium lanuginosum var. sericeum, commonly known as silky hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silky, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, ditches, and pine flatwoods. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
