    "intro": "Draba frigida var. kamtschatica, commonly known as the Kamchatka rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the cold regions of eastern Siberia and the Russian Far East. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops and weeds. This species is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, basal leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. The plant is notable for its frost tolerance and is often found in mountainous regions where temperatures remain low throughout much of the year."
