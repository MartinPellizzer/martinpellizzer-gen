    "intro": "Dipterocarpus condorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian dipterocarp, is a tropical tree native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae, which includes many large, valuable timber trees. The plant is characterized by its buttressed roots, which help it stabilize in shallow, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers and is an important component of the cloud forest ecosystem."
