    "intro": "Dalea angulata, commonly known as the angular milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its root system forms nodules with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. The angular milkvetch is often found in open habitats and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
