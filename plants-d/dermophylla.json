    "intro": "Dermophylla, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming growth habit and are often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Dermophylla species produce small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, a common feature in the carrot family. They are adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making them important components of desert ecosystems."
