    "intro": "Dendrobium microphthalmum, commonly known as the small-eyed dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white to greyish pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
