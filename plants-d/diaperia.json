    "intro": "Diaperia, commonly known as the \"dwarf bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Campanulaceae family. It consists of several species, most of which are small, herbaceous plants native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves and produce showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white. Diaperia species often thrive in moist, well-drained soils and are found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in native plant gardens."
