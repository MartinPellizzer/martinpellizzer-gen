It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often glabrous on both sides. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody capsules that contain several seeds. It is known for its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for construction and furniture. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it an important component of degraded forest ecosystems."
