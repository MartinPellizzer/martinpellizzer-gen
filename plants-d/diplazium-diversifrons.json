    "intro": "Diplazium diversifrons, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that can form dense colonies in still or slow-moving water. Its leaves are typically divided into small, linear segments, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Diplazium diversifrons thrives in humid environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds."
