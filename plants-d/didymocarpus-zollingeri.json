It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. It produces small, red berries that are edible and often consumed by local communities. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
