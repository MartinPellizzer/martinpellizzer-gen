It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale violet. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Datura microcarpa is known for its toxic properties, containing tropane alkaloids such as scopolamine and hyoscyamine. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
