    "intro": "Drimia humilis, commonly known as the African lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features tuberous roots and linear, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base. The plant produces clusters of white or pale blue flowers on tall, slender stems during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Drimia humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
