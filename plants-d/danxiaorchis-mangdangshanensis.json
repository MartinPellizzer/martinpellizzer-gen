It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and adaptations to its specialized habitat. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices and limestone areas, showcasing its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually small and pale, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a conservation priority."
