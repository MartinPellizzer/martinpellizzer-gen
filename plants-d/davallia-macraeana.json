    "intro": "Davallia macraeana, commonly known as the Macrae's shield fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing structures called sori. Davallia macraeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
