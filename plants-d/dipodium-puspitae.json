    "intro": "Dipodium puspitae, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an adaptable species in various habitats."
