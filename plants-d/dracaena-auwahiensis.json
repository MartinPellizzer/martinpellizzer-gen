    "intro": "Dracaena auwahiensis, commonly known as the Auwahi dracaena, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red berries. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Dracaena auwahiensis is critically endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts."
