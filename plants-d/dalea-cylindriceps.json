    "intro": "Dalea cylindriceps, commonly known as the cylinderhead milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink to purple in color and bloom in late spring to early summer. Dalea cylindriceps is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to arid environments."
