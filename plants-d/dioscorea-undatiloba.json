    "intro": "Dioscorea undatiloba, commonly known as the African yambean, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part. These tubers are rich in starch and have been traditionally used as a food source in some African communities. The plant also has medicinal uses in traditional herbal practices."
