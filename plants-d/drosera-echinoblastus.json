    "intro": "Drosera echinoblastus, commonly known as the globular sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, globular rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a tight cluster, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Due to its unique appearance and carnivorous habits, it is a popular subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
