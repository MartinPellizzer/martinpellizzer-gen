It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and dark green, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The fronds are typically divided into several pinnae, with each pinna having a serrated edge. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush foliage."
