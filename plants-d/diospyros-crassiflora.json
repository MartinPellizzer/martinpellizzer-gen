It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to black when mature. Diospyros crassiflora is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in traditional craftsmanship and as a source of timber."
