    "intro": "Dryopteris falciculata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that are often covered in a cinnamon-colored bloom on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are robust and allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The fern's unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
