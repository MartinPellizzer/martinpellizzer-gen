    "intro": "Dryopteris paripinnata, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, overlapping fronds that form a rosette shape, resembling a bird's nest. The plant has a long, creeping rhizome that helps it spread and establish dense colonies. Its leaves are typically leathery and dark green, with a waxy surface that aids in moisture retention. This fern thrives in humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in shaded areas."
