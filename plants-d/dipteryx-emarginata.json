    "intro": "Dipteryx emarginata, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous fruits that contain multiple seeds, each enclosed in a hard, woody capsule. The tree can grow up to 50 meters tall and has a dense canopy, contributing to the forest's biodiversity. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it produces yellowish-green flowers that are pollinated by specific insects. The Brazil nut tree plays a vital ecological role and is economically significant for its valuable seeds."
