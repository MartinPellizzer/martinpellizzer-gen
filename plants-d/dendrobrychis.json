    "intro": "Dendrobrychis, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, the Americas, and parts of Asia. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their compound leaves and showy, often yellow or orange, pea-like flowers. Dendrobrychis species are known for their ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, which enriches the soil. The fruits are usually pods containing seeds that are dispersed by wind or animals, contributing to the plant's ecological role in various habitats."
