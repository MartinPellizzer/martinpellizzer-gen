    "intro": "Dipteracanthus neowedia, commonly known as the New Zealand ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has modified stems that perform photosynthesis. It thrives in cool, humid environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in forested areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
