    "intro": "Dryopteris hunanica, commonly known as the Hunan wood fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to China. It is characterized by its erect, slender rhizomes and the production of small, clustered fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that gives the plant a refined look. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
