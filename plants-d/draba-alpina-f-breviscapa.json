    "intro": "Draba alpina f. breviscapa, commonly known as the Alpine Draba, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features a compact rosette of basal leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its short, sturdy stems and hairy foliage, which help it withstand harsh mountain conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and scree slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is a common component of alpine flora and plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
