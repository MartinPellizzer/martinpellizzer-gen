    "intro": "Diclytra ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow-winged grasshopper, is a species of leafhopper belonging to the family Cicadellidae. It is characterized by its slender body and distinctive yellow wings, which set it apart from other members of its family. This plant-feeding insect is typically found in grassy areas and is often associated with crops such as corn and soybeans. Its life cycle involves laying eggs in plant tissue, where the nymphs develop through several instars before reaching adulthood. Due to its feeding habits, it can sometimes cause damage to agricultural plants, making it a pest of concern in certain regions."
