    "intro": "Diosma squamosa, commonly known as the scaly diosma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its hairy, often scaly stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its small, white or purple flowers bloom in the spring, and it produces berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. Diosma squamosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
