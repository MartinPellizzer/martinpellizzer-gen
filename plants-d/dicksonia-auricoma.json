    "intro": "Dicksonia auricoma, commonly known as the golden tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a distinctive crown of bright yellow, fan-shaped fronds that give it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in its ecological role."
