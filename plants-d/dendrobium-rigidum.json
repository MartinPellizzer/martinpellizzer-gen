    "intro": "Dendrobium rigidum, commonly known as the rigid orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a tall, upright stem with numerous leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white or yellow flowers. Its flowers are typically long-lasting and bloom during the warm season. Dendrobium rigidum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
