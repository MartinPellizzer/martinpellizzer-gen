    "intro": "Diplocyclos schliebenii, commonly known as the Schlieben's cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family. It is a small, evergreen cycad with a stout, unbranched stem and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cones that are typically borne in clusters. Native to Madagascar, it thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
