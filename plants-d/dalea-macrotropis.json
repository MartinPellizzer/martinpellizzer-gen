    "intro": "Dalea macrotropis, commonly known as the large-fruited milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Dalea macrotropis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife."
