    "intro": "Desmocladus lateriticus, commonly known as the lateritic desmocladus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellowish or reddish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, lateritic soils, which are typically dry and rocky. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals in its native environment. Desmocladus lateriticus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
