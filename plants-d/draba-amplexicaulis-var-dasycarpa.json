    "intro": "Draba amplexicaulis var. dasycarpa, commonly known as the woolly rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing habit, characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are basal and clasping, forming a rosette that protects the stem and roots. This variety is distinguished by its more robust and hairy growth compared to other forms of Draba amplexicaulis."
