    "intro": "Dactyloctenium nitidum, commonly known as the smooth grass or velvet grass, is a tropical annual grass species characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and agricultural areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in warm climates. Dactyloctenium nitidum is also noted for its potential as a forage plant for livestock in certain regions."
