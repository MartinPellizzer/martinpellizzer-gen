    "intro": "Deschampsia berteroniana var. parvispicula, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, soft blades and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
