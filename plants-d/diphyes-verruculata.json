    "intro": "Diphyes verruculata, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap prey, primarily aquatic insects. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and ponds. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be partially emergent. The species is known for its ability to thrive in stagnant water and its unique method of nutrient acquisition through prey digestion."
