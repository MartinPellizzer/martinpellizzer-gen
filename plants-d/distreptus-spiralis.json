    "intro": "Distreptus spiralis, commonly known as the spiral lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive spiral growth pattern on its thallus. It typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in temperate and boreal forest environments. The thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It lacks true leaves but has a layered structure composed of fungal hyphae and algal cells. This lichen is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and environmental conditions."
