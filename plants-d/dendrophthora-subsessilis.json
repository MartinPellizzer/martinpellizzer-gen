    "intro": "Dendrophthora subsessilis, commonly known as the sessile-stalked mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and white, gelatinous berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is native to certain regions of South America and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host species and the forest ecosystem."
