    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 lawalreei, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a hybrid fern that results from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris pentaphylla. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often golden-green fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in groups called sori."
