    "intro": "Deyeuxia quadriseta, commonly known as the four-sided grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Botanically, it is characterized by its four-sided stems and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
