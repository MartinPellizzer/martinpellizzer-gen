    "intro": "Dryopteris alatella, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, deeply divided fronds that resemble a feather. It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's fertile fronds produce spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The cinnamon fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
