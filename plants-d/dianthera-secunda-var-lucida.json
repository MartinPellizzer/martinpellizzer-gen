    "intro": "Dianthera secunda var. lucida, commonly known as the shining dianthera, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a subtle iridescence. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery bloom, which gives it the \"lucida\" designation. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to temperate climates."
