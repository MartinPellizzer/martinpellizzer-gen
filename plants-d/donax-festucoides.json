    "intro": "Donax festucoides, commonly known as narrowleaf rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 inch wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense spikes. Donax festucoides is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
