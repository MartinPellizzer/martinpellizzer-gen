    "intro": "Delphinium puniceum var. damaecornu, commonly known as the scarlet larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spires of vibrant crimson or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its toxicity, care should be taken to avoid ingestion by humans and animals."
