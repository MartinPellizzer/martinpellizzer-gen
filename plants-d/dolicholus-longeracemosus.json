    "intro": "Dolicholus longeracemosus, commonly known as the long-branched dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers and long, slender stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it attaches to various host species. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
