    "intro": "Desmodium callilepis, commonly known as the spurred desmodium, is a perennial legume native to Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces distinctive spurred pods that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Desmodium callilepis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility."
