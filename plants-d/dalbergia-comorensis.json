    "intro": "Dalbergia comorensis, commonly known as the Comoro rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the Comoros archipelago. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces hard, dark timber that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest ecosystems. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
