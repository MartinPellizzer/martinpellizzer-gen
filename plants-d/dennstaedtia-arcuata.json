    "intro": "Dennstaedtia arcuata, commonly known as the curl fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that curl upward, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with slender, linear pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
