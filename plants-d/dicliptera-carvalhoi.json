It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is known for its starchy rhizomes, which are used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense tussocks, while its flowers are typically greenish or pale in color.
