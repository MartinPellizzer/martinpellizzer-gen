    "intro": "Didymopanax utiarityensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rubber tree, is a tropical evergreen plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, elongated fruits containing a single seed. Its latex sap, similar to that of Hevea brasiliensis, has been historically used for industrial purposes. However, it is less commercially significant than other rubber-producing plants due to its lower latex yield."
