    "intro": "Dryopteris fructuosa, commonly known as the fruiting wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
