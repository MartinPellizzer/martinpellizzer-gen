    "intro": "Davallia ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf serrata, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Davallia ligulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is popular in horticulture for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
