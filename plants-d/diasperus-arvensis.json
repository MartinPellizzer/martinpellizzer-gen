    "intro": "Diasperus arvensis, commonly known as field pennycress, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops like mustard and cabbage. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, with trifoliate leaves and small yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Its seeds are encased in a hard, waxy coating, which aids in their dispersal and survival in various soil types. Field pennycress is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
