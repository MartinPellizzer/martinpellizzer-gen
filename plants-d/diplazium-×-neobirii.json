    "intro": "Diplazium \u00d7 neobirii, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Diplazium esculentum and Diplazium sylvestre. It is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its feathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces both sterile and fertile spore-bearing structures, though it is primarily known for its ornamental value rather than its reproductive capabilities. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
