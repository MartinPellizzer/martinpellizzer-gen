    "intro": "Doodia lyonii, commonly known as the Lyon's maidenhair fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the forest floor. Doodia lyonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens."
