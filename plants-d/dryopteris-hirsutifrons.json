    "intro": "Dryopteris hirsutifrons, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply divided fronds that are covered with fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its rhizomes are robust and help it establish in nutrient-poor soils. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
