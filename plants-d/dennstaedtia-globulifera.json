    "intro": "Dennstaedtia globulifera, commonly known as the globular fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape, which is formed by tightly clustered fronds that give it a rounded appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies or in rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia borne on the underside of the leaves. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
