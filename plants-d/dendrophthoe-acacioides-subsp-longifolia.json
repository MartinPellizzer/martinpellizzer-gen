    "intro": "Dendrophthoe acacioides subsp. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily acacia species. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in parts of Africa and Asia."
