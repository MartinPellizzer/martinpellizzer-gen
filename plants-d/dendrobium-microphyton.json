    "intro": "Dendrobium microphyton, commonly known as the miniature dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. The plant features a compact growth habit with small, lance-shaped leaves and produces fragrant, clustered flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright but indirect light. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in homes and greenhouses."
