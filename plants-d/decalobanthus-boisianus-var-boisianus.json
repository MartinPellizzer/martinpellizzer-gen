    "intro": "Decalobanthus boisianus var. boisianus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features basal leaves that are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-green hue, while its flowering stems bear small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
