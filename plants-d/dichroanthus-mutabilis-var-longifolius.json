    "intro": "Dichroanthus mutabilis var. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved dichroanthus, is a flowering plant native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has lance-shaped leaves that are longer than those of the typical variety. Its flowers are clustered in loose racemes and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is noted for its variability in leaf shape and flowering time, which contributes to its ecological adaptability."
