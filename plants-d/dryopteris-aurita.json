    "intro": "Dryopteris aurita, commonly known as the barren chain fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that are divided into a series of narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris aurita is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
