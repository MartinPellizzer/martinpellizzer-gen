    "intro": "Daphne \u00d7 eschmannii, commonly known as the Eschmann daphne, is a hybrid shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, evergreen foliage with a leathery texture and dark green color. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in well-drained soil. However, it is toxic to humans and animals, requiring caution in garden settings."
