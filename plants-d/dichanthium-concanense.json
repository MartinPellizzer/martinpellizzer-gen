    "intro": "Dichanthium concanense, commonly known as the coastal grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of India. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to withstand saline and wind conditions. Dichanthium concanense plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
