It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. Its seeds are enclosed in small, woody pods that split open to release the seeds. Dodonaea stenoptera is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of Australia."
