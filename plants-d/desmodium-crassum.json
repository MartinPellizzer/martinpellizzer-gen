    "intro": "Desmodium crassum, commonly known as broadleaf desmodium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Desmodium crassum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in soil enrichment."
