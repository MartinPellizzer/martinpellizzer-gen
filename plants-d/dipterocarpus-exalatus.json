    "intro": "Dipterocarpus exalatus, commonly known as the white dipterocarp, is a large tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, elliptical leaves. The tree produces heavy, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It plays a significant role in the ecosystems of tropical rainforests, providing habitat and contributing to forest structure. Due to its valuable timber, it is also threatened by deforestation and habitat loss."
