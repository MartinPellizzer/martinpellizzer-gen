    "intro": "Digitaria peninsulae, commonly known as the Peninsula grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as sand dunes and coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
