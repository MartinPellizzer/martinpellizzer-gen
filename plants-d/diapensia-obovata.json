    "intro": "Diapensia obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed diapensia, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, obovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a silvery appearance. Its flowers are inconspicuous, usually greenish-white, and are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Diapensia obovata is adapted to harsh, cold environments and plays an important role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
