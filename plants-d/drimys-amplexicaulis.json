    "intro": "Drimys amplexicaulis, commonly known as the Chilean wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its evergreen leaves that are often clasping around the stems. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its aromatic leaves and fruits have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties, and it is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
