    "intro": "Dryopteris urophylla, commonly known as the Japanese Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that are typically upright and shield-shaped. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are divided into segments with a distinctive, curled appearance, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
