    "intro": "Dimorphandra coccinea, commonly known as the red-flowered ironwood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces striking red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Dimorphandra coccinea is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique appearance and ecological benefits."
