    "intro": "Dryopteris efulensis, commonly known as the Eful fern, is a species of polypod fern native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fertile leaves."
