    "intro": "Dryopteris limonensis, commonly known as the lemon-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, bright yellow to greenish-yellow fronds that are often shaped like a fan. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The fronds are divided into multiple pinnae, giving the plant a lush, intricate appearance."
