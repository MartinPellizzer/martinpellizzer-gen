It belongs to the family Rhodomelaceae and is characterized by its dense, bushy growth form and bright red to purple coloration. The plant typically attaches itself to rocky substrates using a holdfast, and it thrives in shallow, sunlit waters. Its structure consists of a thallus with branching filaments that are rich in pigments for photosynthesis. Dicraeia algaeoides plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
