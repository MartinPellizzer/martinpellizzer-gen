    "intro": "Drosera hyperostigma, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are covered in glandular hairs, which secrete a sticky digestive fluid. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its small, white flowers are clustered in a dense inflorescence and bloom during the cooler months. Drosera hyperostigma is a low-growing plant that thrives in nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
