    "intro": "Derris truncata, commonly known as the African spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically borne in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a distinct, truncate (cut-off) appearance at the base. Derris truncata is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine."
