    "intro": "Duckesia liesneri, commonly known as the Liesner's duckesia, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that feature bright yellow to orange petals with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom during the late spring and early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Duckesia liesneri is considered a species of conservation concern."
