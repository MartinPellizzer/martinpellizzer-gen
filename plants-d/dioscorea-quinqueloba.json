    "intro": "Dioscorea quinqueloba, commonly known as the five-lobed yam, is a perennial vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and tuberous roots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its tubers, which are the economically important part, are used as a food source in some cultures. The plant thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
