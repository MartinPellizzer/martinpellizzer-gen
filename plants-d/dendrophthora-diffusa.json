    "intro": "Dendrophthora diffusa, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its ethereal common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high levels of atmospheric humidity to flourish. Its spore-producing structures, known as sorus, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Dendrophthora diffusa is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
