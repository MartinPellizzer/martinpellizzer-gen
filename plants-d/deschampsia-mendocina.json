    "intro": "Deschampsia mendocina, commonly known as Mendo grass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, tufted stems with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Deschampsia mendocina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
