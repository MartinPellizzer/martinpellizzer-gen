    "intro": "Dicraeia stylosa, commonly known as the silky oaks, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland tropical regions. Dicraeia stylosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
