    "intro": "Deppea anisophylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed deppea, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in the cooler, moist conditions of mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a broad, lance-shaped form, while its flowers range in color from white to pink. Deppea anisophylla is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its harsh habitat and its role in local ecosystems."
