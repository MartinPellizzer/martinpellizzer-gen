    "intro": "Dalea hemsleyana, commonly known as Hemsley's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pink to violet pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Dalea hemsleyana is often found in desert scrub and limestone habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
