    "intro": "Diplotropis guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Amazon basin. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, tropical environments. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and orange. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild. Diplotropis guianensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local communities."
