    "intro": "Daphne mezereum var. rubra, commonly known as red mezereon, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, orange-red berries in late summer, which are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are dark green and oval-shaped, with a smooth texture. Daphne mezereum var. rubra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and early blooming habit."
