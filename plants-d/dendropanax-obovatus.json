    "intro": "Dendropanax obovatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf arrowwood, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its alternate, broadly ovate to elliptical leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Dendropanax obovatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
