It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange to red berries. It is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and vibrant fruit, which also attract birds and other wildlife."
