    "intro": "Dryopteris mapiriensis, commonly known as the Mapiri Shield Fern, is a species of fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing a consistent presence in the undergrowth throughout the year."
