    "intro": "Desmodium microphyllum, commonly known as small-leaved desmodium, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowers are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or disturbed areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
