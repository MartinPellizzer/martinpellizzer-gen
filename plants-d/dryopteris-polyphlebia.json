    "intro": "Dryopteris polyphlebia, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The fronds are typically light green and have a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds."
