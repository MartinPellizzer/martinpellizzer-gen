    "intro": "Dryopteris tetragona, commonly known as the four-lobed wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are divided into four lobes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Dryopteris tetragona is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
