    "intro": "Dalbergia toxicaria, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a member of the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are compound, with a pinnate structure, and the tree can grow up to 15 meters tall. The wood is valued for its hardness and resistance to decay, though the plant contains toxic compounds that can be harmful if ingested."
