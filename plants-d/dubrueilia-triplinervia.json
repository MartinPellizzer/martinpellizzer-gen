    "intro": "Dubrueilia triplinervia, commonly known as the three-veined fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's intricate venation pattern, with three prominent veins, gives it its scientific name."
