    "intro": "Drypetes usambarica var. mrimae, commonly known as the Usambara drypetes, is a shrub or small tree native to the East African mountains, particularly Tanzania. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at moderate elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
