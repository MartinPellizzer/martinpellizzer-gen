    "intro": "Dendrobium rhodobalion, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with tall, erect stems that bear numerous lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking clusters of bright red flowers with yellow lips, often blooming in late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated for horticultural purposes in tropical regions."
