    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata nothovar. superglomerata, commonly known as the giant sheep's fescue, is a hybrid grass species characterized by its robust growth and dense, tufted inflorescence. It is notable for its tall, erect stems and large, glomerulate spikelets that give it a distinctive appearance. This variety thrives in a range of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a high tolerance to grazing and environmental stress. It is often used in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and adaptability."
