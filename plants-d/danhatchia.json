    "intro": "Danhatchia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, forming a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi to obtain nutrients. Its leaves are usually small and strap-like, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on its mycorrhizal associations. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Danhatchia is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
