It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, typically in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. Duckesia thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical name honors the botanist John Duckes, who contributed significantly to the study of North American flora."
