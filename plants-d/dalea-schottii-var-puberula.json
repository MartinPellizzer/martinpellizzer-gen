    "intro": "Dalea schottii var. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and it has hairy foliage that gives it its varietal name. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen into the soil, supporting soil fertility and biodiversity in its native range."
