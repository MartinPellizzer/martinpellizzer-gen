It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
