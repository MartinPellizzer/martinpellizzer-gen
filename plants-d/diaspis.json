    "intro": "Diaspis, commonly known as the false holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their evergreen leaves, which are typically opposite or whorled in arrangement. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Diaspis species are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their attractive foliage and compact growth habit."
