    "intro": "Dendrocnide subclausa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stinging tree, is a flowering plant native to northern Australia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle-like plants known for their irritant properties. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its stems and leaves contain toxic calcium oxalate crystals, which cause severe skin irritation upon contact. This species is often found in rainforest and coastal scrub habitats, thriving in humid, tropical conditions."
