    "intro": "Deparia gordonii, commonly known as Gordon's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky outcrops. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new growth, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a defining feature of ferns."
