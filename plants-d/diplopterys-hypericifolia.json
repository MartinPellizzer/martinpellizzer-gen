    "intro": "Diplopterys hypericifolia, commonly known as the Amazonian bitter apple, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. Its fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains several seeds, and it is often found in humid, lowland forests. Due to its medicinal properties and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but rare species in its native range."
