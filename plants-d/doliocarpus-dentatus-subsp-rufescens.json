It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and lanceolate, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental bark and has limited use in traditional medicine."
