    "intro": "Dendrobium plumilobum, commonly known as the slender-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces long, thin pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Dendrobium plumilobum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
