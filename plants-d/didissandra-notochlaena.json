    "intro": "Didissandra notochlaena, commonly known as the mountain sandstone plant, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by its fleshy leaves and adaptations to dry environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, attracting pollinators such as bees and beetles. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration. Didissandra notochlaena is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
