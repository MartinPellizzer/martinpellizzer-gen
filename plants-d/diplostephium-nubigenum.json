    "intro": "Diplostephium nubigenum, commonly known as the cloud-dwelling spurge, is a rare and unique plant species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, adapting it to arid and mountainous environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Diplostephium nubigenum is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
