    "intro": "Deschampsia straminea, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Deschampsia straminea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
