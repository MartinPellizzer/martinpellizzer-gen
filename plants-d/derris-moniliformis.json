    "intro": "Derris moniliformis, commonly known as the African snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for containing rotenone, a toxic compound used in traditional fishing and pest control. Its roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, though they must be handled with care due to their potent nature. Derris moniliformis typically grows in moist, shaded areas and is an important component of its native ecosystems."
