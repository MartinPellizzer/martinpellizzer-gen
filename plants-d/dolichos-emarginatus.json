It features slender, twining stems that can reach several meters in length, supported by tendrils that aid in climbing. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with leaflets that have a distinctive marginated appearance. Dolichos emarginatus is often grown for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
