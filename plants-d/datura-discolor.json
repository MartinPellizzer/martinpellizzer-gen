    "intro": "Datura discolor, commonly known as the white angel's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has velvety, hairy leaves and produces toxic, spiny capsules that contain seeds. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its hallucinogenic properties due to the presence of tropane alkaloids. Datura discolor is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
