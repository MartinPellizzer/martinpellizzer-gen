    "intro": "Dryopteris cacaina, commonly known as the Cacanai Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The Cacanai Shield Fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
