    "intro": "Dirachma, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers. The leaves are typically velvety and heart-shaped, often with a waxy texture. Dirachma species are popular houseplants due to their ability to thrive in indirect light and their relatively low maintenance requirements. They produce small, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the year under proper care."
