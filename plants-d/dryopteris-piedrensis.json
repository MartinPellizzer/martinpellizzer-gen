    "intro": "Dryopteris piedrensis, commonly known as the Piedrense wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
