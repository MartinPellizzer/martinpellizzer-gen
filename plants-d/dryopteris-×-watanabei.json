    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 watanabei, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris japonica and Dryopteris erythrogramma. It is a medium-sized evergreen fern characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas across Japan. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its lush, tropical appearance."
