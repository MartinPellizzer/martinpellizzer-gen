    "intro": "Dianella rara, commonly known as the rare lady's tears, is a striking evergreen perennial native to New Zealand. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, low-growing rosette, often with a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers during late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
