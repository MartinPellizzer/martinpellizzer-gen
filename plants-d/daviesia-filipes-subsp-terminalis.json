    "intro": "Daviesia filipes subsp. terminalis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed honeycomb bush, is a shrub native to south-western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive honeycomb-like structure formed by its dense, erect, cylindrical flower spikes. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer to autumn, which are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a hairy texture, and it is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils. This species is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
