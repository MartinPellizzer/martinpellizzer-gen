    "intro": "Dryopteris longistipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that allow it to spread slowly over time. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that gives it a graceful look in woodland settings. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks."
