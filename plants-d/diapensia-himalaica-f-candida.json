    "intro": "Diapensia himalaica f. candida, commonly known as the white-flowered diapensia, is a rare and delicate alpine plant native to the Himalayan regions. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in shaded, rocky habitats. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and arranged in a compact rosette, adapted to withstand cold and harsh mountain conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
