    "intro": "Dendrochilum malindangense, commonly known as the Malindangense tree orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring elongated, pendulous flowers with intricate patterns of purple and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the rainforest canopy. Its leaves are ovate and\u9769\u8d28, providing structural support and aiding in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
