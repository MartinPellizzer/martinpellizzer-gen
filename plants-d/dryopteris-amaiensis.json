    "intro": "Dryopteris amaiensis, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers cool, humid conditions."
