    "intro": "Diospyros setosa, commonly known as the rough persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into clustered, orange-red fruits. The fruits are typically edible when fully ripe, though they may have a mild astringent taste. Diospyros setosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production in tropical and subtropical regions."
