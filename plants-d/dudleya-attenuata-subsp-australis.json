    "intro": "Dudleya attenuata subsp. australis, commonly known as the coastal Dudleya, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking clusters of yellow flowers during the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
