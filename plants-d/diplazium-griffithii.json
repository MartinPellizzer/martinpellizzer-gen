    "intro": "Diplazium griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. Diplazium griffithii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
