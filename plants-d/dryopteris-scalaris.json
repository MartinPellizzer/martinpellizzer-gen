    "intro": "Dryopteris scalaris, commonly known as the barren woods fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive scalloped edge along the margins. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris scalaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
