    "intro": "Dichanthelium dichotomum var. ensifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often broader than those of the typical dichotomum variety. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowering stems are usually erect and bear small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
