    "intro": "Dryopteris separabilis, commonly known as the sensitive fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant's name derives from its tendency to curl or fold its fronds when touched, a defensive mechanism against herbivores. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new plants through vegetative propagation. The spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
