It features showy, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Detris hyssopifolia is often used in native plant gardens for its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
