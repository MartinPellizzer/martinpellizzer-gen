    "intro": "Diplazium plantaginifolium var. serratum, commonly known as the serrated rock fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a compact, rhizomatous growth habit with dark green, lanceolate leaves that have serrated margins. The fronds are typically divided into pinnae, which are further subdivided into smaller pinnules, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
