    "intro": "Danthonia pallida, commonly known as the pale danthonia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like blades with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
