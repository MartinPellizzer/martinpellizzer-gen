    "intro": "Drypetes sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaf drypetes, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often leathery in texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
