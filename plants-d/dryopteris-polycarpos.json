    "intro": "Dryopteris polycarpos, commonly known as the eastern wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its triangular, pinnately compound fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in groups called sori."
