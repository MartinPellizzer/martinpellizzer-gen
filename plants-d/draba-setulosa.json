    "intro": "Draba setulosa, commonly known as the woolly whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Draba setulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
