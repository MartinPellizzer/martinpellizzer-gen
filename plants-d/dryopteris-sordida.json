    "intro": "Dryopteris sordida, commonly known as the rusty wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that often have a rust-colored appearance due to the presence of stichids. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris sordida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
