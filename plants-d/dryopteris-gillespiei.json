    "intro": "Dryopteris gillespiei, commonly known as the Gillespie's wood fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the United States, specifically found in Texas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils within woodland habitats. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
