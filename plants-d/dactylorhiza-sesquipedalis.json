    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sesquipedalis, commonly known as the long-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a complex root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is common among orchids. It prefers moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its flowers are often pink or purple, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects."
