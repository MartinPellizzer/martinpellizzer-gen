    "intro": "Delphinium pachycentrum var. lancisepalum, commonly known as the broad-leaf larkspur, is a tall perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, arranged in tall, spires. The plant has large, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a desirable addition to rock gardens and alpine gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
