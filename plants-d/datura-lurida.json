    "intro": "Datura lurida, commonly known as the desert datura, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. The plant has hairy, ribbed stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Datura lurida contains toxic alkaloids and is considered a poisonous plant, though it has been used historically in traditional medicine."
