    "intro": "Diasperus reticulatus, commonly known as the net-veined fern, is a species of fern characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce clusters of small, delicate fronds. Its leaves are typically pinnately divided, with a distinctive network of veins that give it its common name. Diasperus reticulatus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
