    "intro": "Dictyanthus, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Dictyanthus species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. They are often found in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils, and some species are considered weeds."
