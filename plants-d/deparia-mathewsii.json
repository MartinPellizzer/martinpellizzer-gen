    "intro": "Deparia mathewsii, commonly known as the Mathews' shield fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its intricate, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation status."
