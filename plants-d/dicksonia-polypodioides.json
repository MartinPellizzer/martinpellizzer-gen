    "intro": "Dicksonia polypodioides, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a thick, woody base, which helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside, with a serrated edge. Dicksonia polypodioides thrives in humid climates and is often found in rainforests or along coastal regions."
