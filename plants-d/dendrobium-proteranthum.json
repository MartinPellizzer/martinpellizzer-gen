    "intro": "Dendrobium proteranthum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the dry season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its tropical environment. Dendrobium proteranthum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
