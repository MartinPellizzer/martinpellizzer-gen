    "intro": "Draba stenoloba var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with small, basal leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often growing in well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its compact form and early blooming period make it a characteristic component of alpine flora. It is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in meadows and slopes above the tree line."
