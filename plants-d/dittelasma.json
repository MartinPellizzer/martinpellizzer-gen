    "intro": "Dittelasma, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. The plants typically have opposite, ovate leaves and produce showy, tubular flowers in various colors. Dittelasma species are often found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. They are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though their toxicity limits their widespread use."
