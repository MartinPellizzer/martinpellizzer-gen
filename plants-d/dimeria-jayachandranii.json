It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its small, erect growth habit and distinctive yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, showcasing features such as reduced leaf size and deep root systems. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations in arid ecosystems."
