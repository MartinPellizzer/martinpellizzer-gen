    "intro": "Davallia polypodioides var. pilosula, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ease of care and aesthetic appeal."
