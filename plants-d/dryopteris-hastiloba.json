    "intro": "Dryopteris hastiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 cm long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a typical feature of ferns."
