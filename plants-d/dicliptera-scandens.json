    "intro": "Dicliptera scandens, commonly known as the climbing dicliptera, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its twining stems that climb along other vegetation, forming dense foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a rough texture. Dicliptera scandens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
