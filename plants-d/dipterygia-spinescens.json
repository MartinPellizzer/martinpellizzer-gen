    "intro": "Dipterygia spinescens, commonly known as the spiny dipterygia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its unique spiny structures on the stems and leaves help deter herbivores. Dipterygia spinescens plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
