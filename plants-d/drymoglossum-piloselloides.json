    "intro": "Drymoglossum piloselloides, commonly known as the silky fern, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, wiry stems and small, overlapping, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the substrate. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
