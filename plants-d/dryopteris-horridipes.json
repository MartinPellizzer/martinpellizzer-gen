    "intro": "Dryopteris horridipes, commonly known as the humped back wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, hump-backed fronds that are dark green and often have a rough, hairy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Dryopteris horridipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
