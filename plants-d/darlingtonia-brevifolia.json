    "intro": "Darlingtonia brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, lid-like structure that covers its elongated, tubular pitcher-shaped leaves. The plant's pitchers are typically green with red veins and produce a sweet-smelling nectar to attract insects. Darlingtonia brevifolia thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and seepage areas. Its unique morphology and specialized trapping mechanism make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
