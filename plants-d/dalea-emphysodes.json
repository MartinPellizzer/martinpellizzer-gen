    "intro": "Dalea emphysodes, commonly known as the bladderpod milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its seed pods are inflated and resemble bladders, a unique feature that aids in seed dispersal. Dalea emphysodes plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
