    "intro": "Dioscorea pachycarpa, commonly known as the thick-fruited yam, is a perennial vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its robust, climbing stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers followed by fleshy, cylindrical fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its tubers, which are the primary edible part, are rich in starch and have been used traditionally for food and medicinal purposes. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
