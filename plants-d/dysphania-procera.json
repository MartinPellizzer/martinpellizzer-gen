    "intro": "Dysphania procera, commonly known as giant red leaf chenopod, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and large, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically surrounded by bracts. Dysphania procera is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines, though the plant is also considered a weed in some agricultural contexts."
