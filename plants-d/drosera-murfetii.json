    "intro": "Drosera murfetii, commonly known as the Murfet's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects, providing essential nutrients in nutrient-poor environments. The plant typically grows in shallow, boggy areas and thrives in high humidity and moderate temperatures. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring, adding a delicate floral display to its appearance. Drosera murfetii is a popular species among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its unique morphology and ease of cultivation."
