    "intro": "Diedropetala puniceum, commonly known as the crimson droplet orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its vivid red petals and sepals, which are often adorned with intricate patterns resembling droplets of liquid. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically between September and November. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
