    "intro": "Descurainia adpressa, commonly known as the creeping tansy, is a low-growing annual herb native to North America. It features a sprawling growth habit with prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine, glandular hairs. Descurainia adpressa is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its ability to thrive in dry, sandy environments."
