    "intro": "Dryopteris blanchetiana, commonly known as the Blanquet's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
