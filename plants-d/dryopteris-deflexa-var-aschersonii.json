    "intro": "Dryopteris deflexa var. aschersonii, commonly known as the Ascherson's holly fern, is a variant of the flexible wood fern. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and well-drained soil."
