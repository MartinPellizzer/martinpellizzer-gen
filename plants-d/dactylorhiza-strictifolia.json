    "intro": "Dactylorhiza strictifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bog orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically blooms with pale yellow to greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, often found in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and marshes. It is a semi-evergreen species that thrives in cool, moist environments and is often associated with peatlands. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and conservation-dependent species in many regions."
