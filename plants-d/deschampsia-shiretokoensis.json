    "intro": "Deschampsia shiretokoensis, commonly known as Shiretoko grass, is a rare and endemic species native to the Shiretoko Peninsula in Japan. It is a low-growing, perennial grass that thrives in moist, cool environments, typically found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny seeds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its restricted habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
