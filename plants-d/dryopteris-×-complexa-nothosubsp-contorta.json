    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 complexa nothosubsp. contorta, commonly known as the twisted shield fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carthusiana and Dryopteris affinis, leading to a complex genetic structure. The plant typically features fronds that are arched or semi-erect, with a distinctive, twisted appearance that sets it apart from its parent species. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a dense, compact form that makes it suitable for shaded garden environments. This nothosubspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
