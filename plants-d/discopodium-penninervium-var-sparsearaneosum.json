    "intro": "Discopodium penninervium var. sparsearaneosum, commonly known as the sparse-leaf rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features a compact rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy, ornamental plant suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
