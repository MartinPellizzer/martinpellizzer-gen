    "intro": "Dianthus brevipetalus, commonly known as the short-petaled campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, clustered inflorescences. Its small, delicate petals are distinctive for their short, rounded bases, which give the species its scientific name. Dianthus brevipetalus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats."
