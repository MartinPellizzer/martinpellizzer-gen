    "intro": "Dendrorkis wightii, commonly known as the Wight's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a dense network beneath the soil, aiding in its stability. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a graceful, arching appearance that adds to its ornamental value. Dendrorkis wightii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense tropical forests."
