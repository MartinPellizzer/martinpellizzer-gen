    "intro": "Dendrocolla zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's tree fern, is a unique member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feather-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to the tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species. Its fibrous roots and ability to absorb moisture from the air make it well adapted to its ecological niche."
