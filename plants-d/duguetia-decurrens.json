    "intro": "Duguetia decurrens, commonly known as the creeping euphorbia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, succulent stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Duguetia decurrens is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
