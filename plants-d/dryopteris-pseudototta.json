    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudototta, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often adorned with spore-producing sori on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
