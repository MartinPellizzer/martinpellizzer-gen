    "intro": "Dendrochilum hastilobum, commonly known as the broad-lipped tree orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a short, stocky rhizome and produces pseudobulbs that are often covered in a thick, velvety coating. The plant's leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, and its inflorescences bear clusters of showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive broad lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Dendrochilum hastilobum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
