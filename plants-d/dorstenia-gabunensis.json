It is native to Central and West Africa, particularly found in the rainforests of Gabon. The plant is characterized by its unique, woolly, and often twisted stems that are covered in dense, white, cottony hairs. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin.
