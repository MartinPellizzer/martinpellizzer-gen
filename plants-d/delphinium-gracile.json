It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal.
