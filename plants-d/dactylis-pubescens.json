    "intro": "Dactylis pubescens, commonly known as hairy grass or velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Dactylis pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and as a forage crop."
