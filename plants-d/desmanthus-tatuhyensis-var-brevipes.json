    "intro": "Desmanthus tatuhyensis var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed burr legume, is a perennial forage plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, trifoliate leaves, and distinctive burr-like seed pods. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and pastures. Its flowers are typically pale pink to lavender, and it produces small, hard seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. This variety is valued for its nutritional content and ability to improve soil fertility through nitrogen fixation."
