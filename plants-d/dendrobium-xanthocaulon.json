    "intro": "Dendrobium xanthocaulon, commonly known as the yellow-leafed orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the dry season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, helping it survive in its natural habitat. The leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions."
