It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
