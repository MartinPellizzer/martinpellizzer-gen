    "intro": "Draba pseudopilosa, commonly known as the rough-haired whitlowgrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, linear leaves and produces small white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Draba pseudopilosa is typically found at high elevations and is often used in ecological studies due to its resilience and specific habitat requirements."
