    "intro": "Dionysia teucrioides, commonly known as the creeping campion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Dionysia teucrioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
