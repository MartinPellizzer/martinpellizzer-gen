    "intro": "Davallia corniculata, commonly known as the feather fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and finely divided. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, moist soil. It produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in specialized structures called sori. Davallia corniculata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and ease of care."
