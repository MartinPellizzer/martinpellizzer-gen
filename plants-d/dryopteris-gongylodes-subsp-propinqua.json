    "intro": "Dryopteris gongylodes subsp. propinqua, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sori that are clustered in lines. The subspecies propinqua is distinguished by its broader and more robust fronds compared to the typical form of D. gongylodes."
