    "intro": "Dryopteris nockiana, commonly known as the Nock's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. The Nock's wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
