    "intro": "Dracaena borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean dragon tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the island of Borneo. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and long, narrow, dark green leaves that are often lined with white veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Dracaena borneensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it an important species in Borneo's biodiversity."
