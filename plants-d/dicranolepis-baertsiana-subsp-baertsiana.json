    "intro": "Dicranolepis baertsiana subsp. baertsiana, commonly known as the Baertsian's fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in moisture retention. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many fern species."
