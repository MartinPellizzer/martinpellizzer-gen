    "intro": "Digitaria eriantha subsp. transvaalensis, commonly known as the Transvaal grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, two-lobed seeds. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in regions with a temperate to subtropical climate. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
