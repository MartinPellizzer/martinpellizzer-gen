    "intro": "Dryopteris polyphylla, commonly known as the western wood fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its intricate fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, often curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the late summer months. Dryopteris polyphylla plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
