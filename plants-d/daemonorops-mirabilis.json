    "intro": "Daemonorops mirabilis, commonly known as the giant panda fern, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cones rather than flowers, which are typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, Daemonorops mirabilis is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions."
