    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa var. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, blue to purple flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream banks. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its ornamental value."
