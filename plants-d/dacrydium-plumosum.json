    "intro": "Dacrydium plumosum, commonly known as the silver pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its slender, tall trunk and feathery, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery bloom, giving it its common name. Dacrydium plumosum is well adapted to the cool, moist climates of its native habitat."
