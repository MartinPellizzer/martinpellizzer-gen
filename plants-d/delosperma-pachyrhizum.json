It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species that spreads via runners. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
