    "intro": "Dryopteris chlamydophora, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive golden-yellow margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with fertile spore-bearing sori arranged along the undersides of the leaves. The golden shield fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
