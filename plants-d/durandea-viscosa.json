    "intro": "Durandea viscosa, commonly known as the sticky durandea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and glandular, sticky leaves. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its sticky secretions, produced by specialized glandular hairs, help in deterring herbivores and trapping small insects. The plant is also noted for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
