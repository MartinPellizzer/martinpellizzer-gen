    "intro": "Dryopteris sorbifolia var. punctivenulosa, commonly known as the spotted-veined wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds with finely divided, serrated leaflets. The leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a pale green to bluish-green coloration. One of its most notable botanical features is the presence of dark, prominent veins that give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and rocky areas. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
