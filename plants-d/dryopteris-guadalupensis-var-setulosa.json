    "intro": "Dryopteris guadalupensis var. setulosa, commonly known as the Guadalupine Shield Fern, is a fern species native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The variety setulosa is distinguished by its finely toothed margins and hairy (setulose) structures on the fronds."
