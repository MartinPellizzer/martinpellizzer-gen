    "intro": "Draba repens, commonly known as the creeping whitlow grass, is a low-growing flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Draba repens is found in alpine and arctic regions, thriving in nutrient-poor environments."
