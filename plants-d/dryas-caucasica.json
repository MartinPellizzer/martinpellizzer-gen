It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features silver-gray leaves with a fuzzy texture, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in early spring. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
