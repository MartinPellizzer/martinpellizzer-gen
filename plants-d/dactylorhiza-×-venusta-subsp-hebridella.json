    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 venusta subsp. hebridella, commonly known as the Hebridean marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Scottish islands. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and linear leaves, which are typically covered in a dense, woolly layer of hair. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in wet, acidic habitats such as peat bogs and damp grasslands. This subspecies is closely related to other Dactylorhiza species and is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms."
