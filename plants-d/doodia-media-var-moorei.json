    "intro": "Doodia media var. moorei, commonly known as the Moore's fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed maidenhair fern. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant features delicate, arching fronds with a feathery appearance, and its leaves are typically dark green with a glossy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
