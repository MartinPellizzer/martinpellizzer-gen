    "intro": "Dipteryx polyphylla, commonly known as the rosewood tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark wood, which is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy and compound leaves that are often feather-like in appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, oval seeds. Due to its ecological importance and economic value, it is also considered an endangered species in many parts of its range."
