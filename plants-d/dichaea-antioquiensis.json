    "intro": "Dichaea antioquiensis, commonly known as the Antioquian dichaea, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety coating. Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, Dichaea antioquiensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
