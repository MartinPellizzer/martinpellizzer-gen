    "intro": "Drynaria wallichii, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, narrow rhizome and its fronds that are typically pinnate with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and can often be found growing on cliffs or in shaded forest areas. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Drynaria wallichii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
