    "intro": "Deiregyne cochleata, commonly known as the spiral-shaped fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, coiled fronds that unfurl as they grow, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This rare and visually striking plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological significance in its native habitat."
