    "intro": "Digitaria hengduanensis, commonly known as the Hengduan mountain grass, is a species of grass native to the Hengduan Mountains in southwestern China. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
