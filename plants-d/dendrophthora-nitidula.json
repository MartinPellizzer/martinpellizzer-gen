    "intro": "Dendrophthora nitidula, commonly known as the glossy bark lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives on the bark of trees in forested areas. It has a distinctive bright green to yellowish-green upper surface that is smooth and shiny, while the lower surface is pale and covered with fine, white rhizines. This lichen is often found on the trunks and branches of deciduous and coniferous trees, particularly in humid environments. Its growth is slow, and it forms dense, mat-like patches that can cover large areas of bark. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate pollution and is often used as an indicator of air quality in ecological studies."
