    "intro": "Danthonia minor, commonly known as the small danthonia, is a low-growing grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and sandy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Due to its ecological importance and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
