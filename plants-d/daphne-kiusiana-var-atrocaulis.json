    "intro": "Daphne kiusiana var. atrocaulis, commonly known as the blackstem daphne, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dark, almost black stems that contrast with its clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are narrow, leathery, and dark green, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from pets and children."
