    "intro": "Duranta mutisii, commonly known as the silverleaf duranta, is a shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Following flowering, it develops blue or purple berries that are edible for some bird species. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
