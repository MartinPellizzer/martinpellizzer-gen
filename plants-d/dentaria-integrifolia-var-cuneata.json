    "intro": "Dentaria integrifolia var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrowleaf toothwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, toothed leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in a tight cluster. The plant produces a tall, unbranched stem with small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Its roots are fleshy and adapted for storing nutrients, which helps it survive in shaded, moist woodland environments. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Dentaria integrifolia."
