    "intro": "Diphasiastrum \u00d7 oellgaardii, commonly known as the hybrid barren stem, is a deciduous fern native to the eastern United States. It is a sterile hybrid between Diphasiastrum complanatum and Diphasiastrum scoparium, resulting in a plant that does not produce spores. The plant is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that remain upright and unbranched throughout the growing season. Its leaves are small, linear, and often appear in a dense, grass-like arrangement. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodland environments."
