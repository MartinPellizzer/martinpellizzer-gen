    "intro": "Daucus flavus, commonly known as the yellow burr\u82b9, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, round fruits that are covered in hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
