    "intro": "Dendrophorbium glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziov's tree-fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its tree-like appearance with a tall, unbranched stem. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobili at the top of its stem. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern, contributing to its distinctive visual appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
