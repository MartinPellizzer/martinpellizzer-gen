    "intro": "Dalea mollis subsp. pilosa, commonly known as hairy prairie clover, is a perennial herb native to the central United States. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in prairie and open woodland habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
