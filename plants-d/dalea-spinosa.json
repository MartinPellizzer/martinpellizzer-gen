    "intro": "Dalea spinosa, commonly known as prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Dalea spinosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
