    "intro": "Deparia zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon wood fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
