    "intro": "Domingoa \u00d7 susiana, commonly known as the hybrid camellia, is a cross between Camellia domingensis and Camellia susanii. It is a shrub native to China and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, camellia-like flowers. The plant produces large, double blooms in shades of red, pink, and white, typically in late winter to early spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often propagated through grafting or cuttings rather than seeds."
