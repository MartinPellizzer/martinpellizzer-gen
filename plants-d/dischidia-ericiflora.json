    "intro": "Dischidia ericiflora, commonly known as the woolly fig or silver vine, is a climbing or trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellowish capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Dischidia ericiflora is often grown as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
