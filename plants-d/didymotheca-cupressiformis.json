    "intro": "Didymotheca cupressiformis, commonly known as the Mexican cypress, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit resembling that of a cypress tree. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract various pollinators. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in a tight, coniferous-like structure. Didymotheca cupressiformis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
