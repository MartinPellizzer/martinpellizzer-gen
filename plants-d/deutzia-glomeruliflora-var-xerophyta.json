    "intro": "Deutzia glomeruliflora var. xerophyta, commonly known as the desert deutzia, is a shrub native to arid regions of China. It features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry environment. It is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for low-water gardens."
