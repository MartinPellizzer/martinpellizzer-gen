    "intro": "Dasystephana gelida, commonly known as the cold-stephan, is a rare alpine plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit and a system of rhizomes that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
