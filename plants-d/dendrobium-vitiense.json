    "intro": "Dendrobium vitiense, commonly known as the Vitiense orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to the Pacific islands. It features tall, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, typically during the dry season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium vitiense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
