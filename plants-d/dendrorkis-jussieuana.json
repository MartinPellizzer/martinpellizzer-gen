It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to trees and other structures. Dendrorkis jussieuana is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
