    "intro": "Dondisia epipactis, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy purple flower with intricate petal structures. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Its flowering period typically occurs during the wet season, ensuring optimal conditions for pollination. Due to habitat destruction, Dondisia epipactis is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique botanical species."
