    "intro": "Dianthus subulifolius, commonly known as the needle-leaved campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of pink or purple flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun conditions. It is a perennial species that is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
