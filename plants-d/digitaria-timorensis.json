    "intro": "Digitaria timorensis, commonly known as Timor grass, is a perennial grass species native to the island of Timor. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in open grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
