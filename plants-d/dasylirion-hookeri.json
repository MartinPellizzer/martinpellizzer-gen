    "intro": "Dasylirion hookeri, commonly known as the Mexican stonecress, is a perennial succulent native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers in the spring. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source by indigenous peoples. The plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is highly drought-tolerant."
