    "intro": "Deschampsia gracilis, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that often form dense mats. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Deschampsia gracilis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
