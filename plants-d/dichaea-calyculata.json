    "intro": "Dichaea calyculata, commonly known as the small-flowered bromeliad, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing moisture from the air. Dichaea calyculata is often grown as a decorative plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
