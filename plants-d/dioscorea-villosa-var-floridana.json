It is characterized by its hairy, sprawling stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by tuberous roots that are the primary part used for medicinal and commercial purposes. Its roots contain compounds such as diosgenin, which is used in the synthesis of hormonal medications. This variety is often found in wetlands and disturbed soils, thriving in humid, temperate climates."
