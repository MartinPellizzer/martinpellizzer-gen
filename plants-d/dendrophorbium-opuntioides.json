It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant features spiny areoles, which are specialized structures that bear flowers and later, fruits. Its flowers are typically yellow or red, adding a vibrant touch to the desert landscape. Dendrophorbium opuntioides plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
