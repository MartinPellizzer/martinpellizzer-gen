    "intro": "Draba caesia, commonly known as the sky-blue draba, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in meadows and scree slopes. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Draba caesia blooms in early spring, producing clusters of blue or violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
