    "intro": "Dioscorea hirsuta var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth yam, is a variant of the hairy yam native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial vine characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by cylindrical, fleshy tubers that are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
