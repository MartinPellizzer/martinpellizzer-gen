    "intro": "Dombeya pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered dombeya, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, often evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and aromatic leaves."
