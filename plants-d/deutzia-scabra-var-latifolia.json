    "intro": "Deutzia scabra var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf deutzia, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features slender, arching stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a rough, sandpapery texture that distinguishes it from other deutzia species. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and hardiness in temperate climates."
