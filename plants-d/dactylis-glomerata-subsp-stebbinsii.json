    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata subsp. stebbinsii, commonly known as the western meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, clump-forming structure, with slender, leafy stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, three-lobed flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable forage species."
