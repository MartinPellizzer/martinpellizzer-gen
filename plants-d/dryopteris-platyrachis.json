    "intro": "Dryopteris platyrachis, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
