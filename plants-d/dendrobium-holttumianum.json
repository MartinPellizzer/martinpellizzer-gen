    "intro": "Dendrobium holttumianum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender stems that can reach up to several feet in length. Its flowers are typically yellow or golden in color, with a distinctive spike-like arrangement. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
