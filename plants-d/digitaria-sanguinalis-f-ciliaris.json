    "intro": "Digitaria sanguinalis f. ciliaris, commonly known as the hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, spreading growth habit and hairy nodes along the stems. The leaves are narrow and flat, with a prominent midrib, and the inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, roadsides, and agricultural fields. This variant is distinguished by its finely ciliate (fringed) lemma margins, which give it its specific epithet."
