    "intro": "Digitaria lomanensis, commonly known as the African bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed panicles, which produce numerous tiny grains. Digitaria lomanensis is adapted to seasonal droughts and is often used for forage in livestock grazing systems."
