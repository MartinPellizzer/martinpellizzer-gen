    "intro": "Dryopteris strigifera, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The hairy wood fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
