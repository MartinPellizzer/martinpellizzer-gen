    "intro": "Dactylorhiza hatagirea, commonly known as the Himalayan orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, stocky rhizome and produces a single spike of pale to dark purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
