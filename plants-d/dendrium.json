    "intro": "Dendrium, commonly known as the tree fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Cyatheaceae. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk that resembles a tree, covered in a thick, fibrous layer called the rachis. The plant produces fronds that can be either sterile or reproductive, with the latter bearing spores on the undersides. Dendrium thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its distinctive appearance and slow growth make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
