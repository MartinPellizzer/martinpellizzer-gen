    "intro": "Drosera stolonifera subsp. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate sundew, is a low-growing carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It features a dense mat of prostrate stems that produce numerous small, sticky tentacles covered in glandular hairs. These hairs secrete a mucilage that traps and digests small insects, providing the plant with essential nutrients. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its compact growth habit and unique trapping mechanism make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
