    "intro": "Desmodium dasyphyllum, commonly known as the velvetleaf desmodium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by pod fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields. Desmodium dasyphyllum is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural settings."
