    "intro": "Drynaria mutilata, commonly known as the broken fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with pinnately divided, leathery fronds that are often dark green in color. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Drynaria mutilata is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant."
