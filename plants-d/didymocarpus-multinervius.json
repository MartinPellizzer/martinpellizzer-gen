    "intro": "Didymocarpus multinervius, commonly known as the Malay apple or cempedak, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins, which contribute to its scientific name \"multinervius.\" The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiky fruits resembling a cluster of small apples. The fruit has a sweet, aromatic pulp surrounded by a fibrous, inedible outer layer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and traditional uses in local medicine."
