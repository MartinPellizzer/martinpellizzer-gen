    "intro": "Deyeuxia tibetica var. przevalskyi, commonly known as the Tibetan false grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystem. This variant is notable for its resilience and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at elevations above 3,000 meters."
