    "intro": "Delphinium brunonianum, commonly known as the Brunonian larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its showy, spurred petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Delphinium brunonianum is also noted for containing toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
