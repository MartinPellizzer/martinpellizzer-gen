    "intro": "Danthonia tortuosa, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with red or purple. Danthonia tortuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
