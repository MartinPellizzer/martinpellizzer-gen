    "intro": "Dryopteris psilosora, commonly known as the silky wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium."
