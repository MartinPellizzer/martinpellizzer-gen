    "intro": "Dracula trinympharum, commonly known as the Ecuadorian vampire orchid, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, dark red flowers that resemble the appearance of a vampire's mouth, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique floral structure, which includes a prominent, hood-like labellum. It thrives in high-altitude, misty environments with high humidity and partial shade. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
