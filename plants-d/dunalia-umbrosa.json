    "intro": "Dunalia umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy dunalia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Leguminosae, also known as the Fabaceae family, which includes many nitrogen-fixing plants. The plant is characterized by its dark green, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Dunalia umbrosa thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
