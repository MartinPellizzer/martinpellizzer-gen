    "intro": "Drymonia coerulea, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Drymonia coerulea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
