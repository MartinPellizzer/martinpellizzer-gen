    "intro": "Danthonia andongensis, commonly known as the Andong grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
