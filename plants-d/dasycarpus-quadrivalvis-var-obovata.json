    "intro": "Dasycarpus quadrivalvis var. obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed cliff brake, is a variant of the common brake fern. It is characterized by its obovate, broad, and leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or cliff habitats. This variety is notable for its distinctive leaf shape and its role in ecological systems where it contributes to soil stabilization."
