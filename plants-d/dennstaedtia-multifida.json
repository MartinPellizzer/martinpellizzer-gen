    "intro": "Dennstaedtia multifida, commonly known as the fern with divided fronds, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into numerous small segments, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are short and stout, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
