    "intro": "Dendrophthoe ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are ovate and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife. Dendrophthoe ovalifolia is often found in forest canopies, where it thrives in partial shade and humid conditions."
