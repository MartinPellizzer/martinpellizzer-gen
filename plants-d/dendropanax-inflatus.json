    "intro": "Dendropanax inflatus, commonly known as the inflated arrowhead, is a species of flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences make it a notable species in moist, shaded forest environments. Dendropanax inflatus is often found in the understory of hardwood forests, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
