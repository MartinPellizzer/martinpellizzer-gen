    "intro": "Dendrobium teligerum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, golden-yellow flowers during the dry season. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Dendrobium teligerum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
