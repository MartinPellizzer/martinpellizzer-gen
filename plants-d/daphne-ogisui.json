    "intro": "Daphne ogisui, commonly known as the Japanese daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often used as a flowering hedge or ornamental plant. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, providing year-round visual interest. Daphne ogisui is relatively low maintenance but requires well-drained soil and partial to full sun for optimal growth."
