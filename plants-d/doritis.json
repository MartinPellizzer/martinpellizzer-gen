    "intro": "Doritis, commonly known as the \"Paddle Plant,\" is a genus of succulent plants native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often shaped like paddles, which help it store water in arid environments. The plants typically produce clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Doritis species are often cultivated for their unique appearance and low maintenance requirements. They thrive in well-draining soil and require minimal water, making them ideal for xeriscaping."
