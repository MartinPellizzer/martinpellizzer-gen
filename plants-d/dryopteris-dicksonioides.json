    "intro": "Dryopteris dicksonioides, commonly known as the Dickson's wood fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its robust, evergreen fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus."
