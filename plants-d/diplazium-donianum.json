    "intro": "Diplazium donianum, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its leaves, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Diplazium donianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
