    "intro": "Dicliptera armata, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has dark, almost black bark and produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Dicliptera armata plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
