    "intro": "Dendrobium speciosum var. boreale, commonly known as the alpine orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in a dense, velvety coating. The plant produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its limited natural habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
