    "intro": "Drymaria effusa, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry meadows. The plant has small, white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Drymaria effusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
