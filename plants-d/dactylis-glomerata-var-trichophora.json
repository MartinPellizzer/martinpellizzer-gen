    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. trichophora, commonly known as the hairy field grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive hairy leaves, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is used in both agricultural and ecological restoration contexts."
