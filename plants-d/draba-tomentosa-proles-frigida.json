    "intro": "Draba tomentosa proles frigida, commonly known as the Arctic mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to cold climates. It features small, basal leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in rocky, alpine, or arctic environments where the soil is well-drained and the climate is cool. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in high-altitude regions and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions."
