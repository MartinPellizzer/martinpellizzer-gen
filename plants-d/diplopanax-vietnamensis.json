    "intro": "Diplopanax vietnamensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous stem system that allows it to spread and colonize new areas in slow-moving or still waters. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
