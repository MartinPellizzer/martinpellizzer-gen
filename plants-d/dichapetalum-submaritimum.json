    "intro": "Dichapetalum submaritimum, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the yellow stamens. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Dichapetalum submaritimum is often used in ornamental gardening due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
