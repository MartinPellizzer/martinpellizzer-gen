    "intro": "Diothonea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, translucent petals that appear to glow in low light conditions. The plant's botanical features include a short, woody stem and small, lance-shaped leaves. Diothonea blooms during the night, emitting a faint bioluminescent light that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Its rare and ethereal appearance has made it a subject of fascination in botanical studies."
