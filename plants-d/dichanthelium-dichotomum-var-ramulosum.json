    "intro": "Dichanthelium dichotomum var. ramulosum, commonly known as the ramulose dichotomous grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumping) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle, which is a branched cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variant is distinguished by its branching structure and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation."
