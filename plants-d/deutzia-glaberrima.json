    "intro": "Deutzia glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth deutzia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features slender, arching branches. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on the previous year's growth. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth texture. Deutzia glaberrima is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
