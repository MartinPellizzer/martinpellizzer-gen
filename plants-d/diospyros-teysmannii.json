    "intro": "Diospyros teysmannii, commonly known as the Java persimmon, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange to red, fleshy berries. Its fruit is edible, though often astringent when unripe, and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in carpentry and tool-making."
