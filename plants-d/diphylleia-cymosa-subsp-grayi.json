    "intro": "Diphylleia cymosa subsp. grayi, commonly known as the gray's diphylleia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, large, white spathes that enclose a cluster of small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is typically found in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
