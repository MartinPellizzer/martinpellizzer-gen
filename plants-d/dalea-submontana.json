    "intro": "Dalea submontana, commonly known as mountain milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Dalea submontana is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
