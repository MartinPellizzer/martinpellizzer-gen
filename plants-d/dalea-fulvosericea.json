    "intro": "Dalea fulvosericea, commonly known as the golden beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, showy flowers. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Dalea fulvosericea is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
