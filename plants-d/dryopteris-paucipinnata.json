    "intro": "Dryopteris paucipinnata, commonly known as the few-pinnate wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and often produce new shoots, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas."
