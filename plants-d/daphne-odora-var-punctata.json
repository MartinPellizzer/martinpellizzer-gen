    "intro": "Daphne odora var. punctata, commonly known as the spotted daphne, is a fragrant evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features dense, glossy dark green foliage that contrasts beautifully with its showy, clustered flowers. The blooms, which appear in late winter to early spring, are typically pink or white with a distinctive red or purple spot at the base of each petal. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens."
