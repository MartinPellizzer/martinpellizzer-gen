    "intro": "Dracaena terniflora, commonly known as the red-edged dracaena, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, strap-like leaves that are typically green with red or reddish margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Dracaena terniflora thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular houseplant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying properties."
