    "intro": "Dioscorea sambiranensis subsp. bardotiae, commonly known as the Bardot's yam, is a member of the Dioscoreaceae family and is native to Madagascar. It is a climbing herbaceous perennial characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant features palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
