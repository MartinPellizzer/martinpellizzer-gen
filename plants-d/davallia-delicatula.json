    "intro": "Davallia delicatula, commonly known as the delicate holly fern, is a compact evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, arching fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture without becoming waterlogged. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance. Its rhizomes form dense, carpet-like growths, making it an excellent choice for terrariums or shaded garden areas."
