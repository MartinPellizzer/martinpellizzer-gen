    "intro": "Dracophyllum acicularifolium, commonly known as the needle-leaved dracophyllum, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid and salty environment. Dracophyllum acicularifolium is adapted to coastal conditions, thriving in sandy soils and enduring salt spray and strong winds."
