It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant has fine, blue-green leaves and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. It is adapted to cold climates and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
