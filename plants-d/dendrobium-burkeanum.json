    "intro": "Dendrobium burkeanum, commonly known as the Burke's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with numerous cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically during the warm season. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged spirally around the stems. Dendrobium burkeanum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
