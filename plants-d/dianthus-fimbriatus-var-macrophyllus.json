    "intro": "Dianthus fimbriatus var. macrophyllus, commonly known as the broad-leafed carnation, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, pink to red flowers with frilly petals that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are broader than those of the typical Dianthus species, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and compact growth habit."
