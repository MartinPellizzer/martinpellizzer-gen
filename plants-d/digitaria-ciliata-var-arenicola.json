    "intro": "Digitaria ciliata var. arenicola, commonly known as beachgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is well-adapted to sandy soils and salt spray, making it an important pioneer species in coastal dunes. Its rapid growth and extensive root system help stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion."
