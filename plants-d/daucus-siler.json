    "intro": "Daucus siler, commonly known as wild carrot or bishop's crown, is a biennial or annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as parsley and dill. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels. Its seeds are small, dry, and often have a distinctive crown-like structure, giving it its common name. Daucus siler is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in some regions."
