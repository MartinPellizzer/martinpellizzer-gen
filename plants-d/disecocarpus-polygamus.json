    "intro": "Disecocarpus polygamus, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is a large, evergreen tree fern that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a trunk that is fibrous and covered in a layer of persistent, brownish scales. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive feather-like appearance, and they can reach lengths of up to 5 meters. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobili, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate rainforests."
