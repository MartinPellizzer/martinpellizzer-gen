    "intro": "Daphnopsis emarginata, commonly known as the emarginate daphnopsis, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, mountainous habitat. Daphnopsis emarginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
