    "intro": "Diploglossum roylei, commonly known as the Indian bryophyte, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in mountainous regions. The plant has a thalloid structure, consisting of a flat, leaf-like body that lacks true leaves, stems, or roots. Its reproductive structures are borne on specialized shoots called gametophores, which produce both male and female reproductive organs. Diploglossum roylei is notable for its ability to survive in extreme environmental conditions, making it an important indicator species in certain ecosystems."
