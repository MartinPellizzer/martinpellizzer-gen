    "intro": "Dendrobium sarcostemma, commonly known as the stone orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. Dendrobium sarcostemma is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and resilience."
