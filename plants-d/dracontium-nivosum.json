    "intro": "Dracontium nivosum, commonly known as the snow-draped arum, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, white, waxy coating, giving it a frost-like appearance. The plant produces a spadix, a fleshy spike of tiny flowers, surrounded by a showy, purple spathe. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and enthusiasts of exotic plants. Dracontium nivosum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil."
