It is a deciduous fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments, with a dark brown to black coloration on the underside. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. This variant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
