    "intro": "Delphinium peregrinum proles longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its foliage consists of deeply lobed, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is best appreciated in gardens for its ornamental value."
