It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with white and green patterns on its broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant belongs to the Araceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps. Dieffenbachia maculosa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
