    "intro": "Dioscorea mollis var. pachycarpa, commonly known as the thick-leaved yam, is a perennial vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in rainforests. Its leaves are heart-shaped and can grow up to 30 cm in diameter, while its stems are hairy and climbing. The tubers, which are the most economically valuable part of the plant, have a starchy texture and are sometimes used as a substitute for potatoes in some cuisines."
