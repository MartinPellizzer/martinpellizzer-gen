    "intro": "Didissandra bhutanica, commonly known as the Bhutan sandalwood, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments at high altitudes. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth surface and a strong, spicy scent. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Didissandra bhutanica is considered critically endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
