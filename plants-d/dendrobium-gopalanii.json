    "intro": "Dendrobium gopalanii, commonly known as the Gopalan's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its clustered growth habit and long, thin pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium gopalanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
