    "intro": "Dubrueilia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf dubrueilia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole. Its showy, five-petaled flowers are typically pink or red and bloom in clusters. Dubrueilia sessilifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
