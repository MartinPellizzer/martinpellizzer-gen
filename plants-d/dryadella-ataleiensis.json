    "intro": "Dryadella ataleiensis, commonly known as the Atalay Island lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Atalaia in Brazil. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that grow from a bulbous stem, typical of many Amaryllidaceae species. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
