    "intro": "Delphinium hansenii, commonly known as Hansen's larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its foliage consists of deeply lobed, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Delphinium hansenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock and humans."
