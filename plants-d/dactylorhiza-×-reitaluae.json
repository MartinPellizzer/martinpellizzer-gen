    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 reitaluae, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a rhizomatous root system and produces a single upright stem bearing several elongated, linear leaves. The plant produces a spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in wet, peaty, or marshy habitats and is often found in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a wide range of morphological variability."
