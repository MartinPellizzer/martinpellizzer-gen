    "intro": "Dedeckera, commonly known as the African orchid, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its showy, often fragrant flowers. The plants typically have pseudobulbs and long, narrow leaves, which help them store water in arid environments. Dedeckera species are often found in forest understories or rocky outcrops, thriving in humid, shaded conditions. Their unique floral structures and adaptations make them an important part of the region's botanical diversity."
