    "intro": "Dillwynia hispida var. glabripes, commonly known as the smooth dillwynia, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the variety 'glabripes' is distinguished by its smoother foliage. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, and range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands."
