    "intro": "Dryadella espirito-santensis, commonly known as the Esp\u00edrito Santo dryadella, is a rare shrub native to the coastal regions of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Brazil. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. It plays a vital role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and supporting local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
