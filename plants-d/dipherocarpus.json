It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Dipherocarpus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. These plants are often valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
