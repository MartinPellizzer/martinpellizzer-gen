    "intro": "Dryandra comosa, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a small evergreen tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with a fine, silky hair. Dryandra comosa is adapted to arid conditions and is well-suited for cultivation in dry, well-drained soils."
