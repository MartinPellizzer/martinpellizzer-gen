    "intro": "Desmodium flagellare, commonly known as the creeping desmodium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a trailing growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its botanical features make it useful in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
