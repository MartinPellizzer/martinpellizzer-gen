    "intro": "Drosera \u00d7 pingellyensis, commonly known as the Pingelly Sundew, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the Droseraceae family and is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and thrives in wet, boggy environments. Its leaves are covered in bright red or orange tentacles that secrete a sticky substance to immobilize prey. This species is prized by carnivorous plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and ecological significance."
