    "intro": "Douglasia biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered douglasia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora. Douglasia biflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
