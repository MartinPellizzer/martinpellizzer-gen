    "intro": "Doronicum oblongifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved leopard's bane, is a perennial herb native to the mountains of Europe. It features upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with orange markings, resembling a leopard's spots, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Doronicum oblongifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
