    "intro": "Drimia brachyandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved African lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant is characterized by its underground bulbs, which store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Drimia brachyandra is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its long-lasting blooms."
