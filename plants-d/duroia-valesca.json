    "intro": "Duroia valesca, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Brazilian mullein, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in some regions."
