    "intro": "Digitalis longiflora, commonly known as the tall foxglove, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and tall, erect stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain cardiac glycosides."
