    "intro": "Danthonia chilensis var. aureofulva, commonly known as the golden hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and bright yellow-green foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and grassy areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
