    "intro": "Dryopteris lunensis, commonly known as the moon's fern, is a species of wood fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically pale green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Dryopteris lunensis is often found growing in association with other ferns and is a valuable component of understory plant communities."
