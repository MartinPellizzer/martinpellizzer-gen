    "intro": "Deprea granulosa, commonly known as the granular deprea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Deprea granulosa is often found growing in moist, shady habitats such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural gardens."
