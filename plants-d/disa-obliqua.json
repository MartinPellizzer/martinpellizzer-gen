    "intro": "Disa obliqua, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a striking South African orchid species characterized by its unique, undulating floral structure. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to the grasslands of South Africa, particularly in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal regions. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single, showy flower that has a distinctive zigzag pattern in its petals and sepals. Disa obliqua thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for cultivation in gardens and botanical collections."
