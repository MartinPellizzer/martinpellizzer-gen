    "intro": "Drosera erythrorhiza subsp. collina, commonly known as the pink-stemmed sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its reddish stems and sticky, glandular leaves that trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a dense cluster, and it produces a unique, pinkish root system. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
