    "intro": "Dorstenia paraguariensis, commonly known as the arrowroot plant, is a member of the family Malvaceae and is native to South America. It is a scrambling shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, and it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Despite its common name, it is not related to true arrowroot, which is a different plant species."
