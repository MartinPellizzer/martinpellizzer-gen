    "intro": "Delphinium sheilae, commonly known as Sheil's larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in racemes along the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with lobes that are often hairy and serrated. Delphinium sheilae is known for its ornamental value in gardens but is also toxic to livestock and humans due to the presence of alkaloids."
