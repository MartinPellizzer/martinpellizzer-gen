    "intro": "Dracaena limbata, commonly known as the red-tipped dracaena, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking dark green leaves with red or purple tips, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a slender, upright growth habit and can reach heights of up to 6 feet in optimal conditions. Its leaves are long and narrow, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. Dracaena limbata is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance requirements."
