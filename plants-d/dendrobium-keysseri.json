    "intro": "Dendrobium keysseri, commonly known as the Keyser's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and store water, allowing it to survive in seasonal droughts. Dendrobium keysseri is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
