    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis var. distans, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long, with a light green to medium green coloration. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, and its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The varietal form distans is distinguished by its more slender fronds compared to the typical form of D. affinis."
