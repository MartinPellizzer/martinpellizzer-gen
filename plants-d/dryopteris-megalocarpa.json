    "intro": "Dryopteris megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a thick, woody trunk that supports the fronds, which are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, palmate appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
