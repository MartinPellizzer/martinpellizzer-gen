    "intro": "Decatropis coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's decatropis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
