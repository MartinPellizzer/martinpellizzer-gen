    "intro": "Dimocarpus gardneri, commonly known as the African starfruit or yellow star-apple, is a tropical tree native to Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into fleshy, star-shaped fruits. The fruit has a sweet, aromatic pulp with a texture similar to that of a starfruit, and it is often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. Dimocarpus gardneri is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and fruit."
