    "intro": "Dalea laevigata, commonly known as plains milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the central and western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, legume-like pods that contain seeds. Dalea laevigata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
