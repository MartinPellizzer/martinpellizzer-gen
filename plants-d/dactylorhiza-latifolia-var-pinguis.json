    "intro": "Dactylorhiza latifolia var. pinguis, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces tall, spike-like inflorescences with pale purple to white flowers. The plant is adapted to moist, acidic soils and often grows in association with other moisture-loving plants. It is a perennial species that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, typical of many orchid species. The variety pinguis is distinguished by its larger, fleshy leaves compared to the typical form of Dactylorhiza latifolia."
