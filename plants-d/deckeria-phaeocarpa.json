    "intro": "Deckeria phaeocarpa, commonly known as the blackwood tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters. The plant is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and small, glossy leaves. It produces small, white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically for construction and tool-making."
