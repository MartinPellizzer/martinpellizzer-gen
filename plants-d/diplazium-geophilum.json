It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage. The plant has rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread horizontally and form thick mats. Its fronds are typically divided into numerous small, oval-shaped segments. Diplazium geophilum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
