These plants are characterized by their tall, often spiny stems and showy, umbrella-shaped inflorescences. The leaves are typically compound, with a distinctive, fern-like appearance. Some species produce large, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dipsacus species can be found in various habitats, including meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils across Europe, Asia, and North America."
