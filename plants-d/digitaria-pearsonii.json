    "intro": "Digitaria pearsonii, commonly known as pearson's digitaria, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it is adapted to thrive in humid environments. Pearson's digitaria is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects."
