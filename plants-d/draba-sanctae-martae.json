    "intro": "Draba sanctae-martae, commonly known as the sacred martyrs' rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. It typically grows at elevations above 4,000 meters, where it faces extreme temperatures and limited soil nutrients. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, Draba sanctae-martae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
