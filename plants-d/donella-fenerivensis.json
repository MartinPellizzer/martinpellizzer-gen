    "intro": "Donella fenerivensis, commonly known as the flameleaf orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, flame-like orange and red petals that stand out in its natural habitat. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its often humid and shaded environment. Due to habitat loss, Donella fenerivensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
