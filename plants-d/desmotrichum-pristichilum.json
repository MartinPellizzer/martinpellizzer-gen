    "intro": "Desmotrichum pristichilum, commonly known as the coastal sandspurry, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It has small, fleshy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from September to November. The plant's leaves are succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune habitats. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
