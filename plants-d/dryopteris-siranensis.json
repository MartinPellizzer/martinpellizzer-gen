    "intro": "Dryopteris siranensis, commonly known as the Siran Shield Fern, is a species of shield fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a distinctive, intricate appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where humidity is high. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
