    "intro": "Dudleya, commonly known as liveforever, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. These succulent plants are native to coastal regions of California and Baja California, where they thrive in rocky and sandy soils. Dudleya species are characterized by their fleshy, water-storing leaves that form a rosette shape, allowing them to store moisture efficiently. They produce vibrant flowers in shades of pink, yellow, and white, typically during the spring and summer months. Due to their hardiness and low maintenance, Dudleya plants are popular choices for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
