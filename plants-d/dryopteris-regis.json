    "intro": "Dryopteris regis, commonly known as the royal wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically arranged in lines. It prefers cool, moist, and shaded environments, often growing in forests or along stream banks. The royal wood fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage."
