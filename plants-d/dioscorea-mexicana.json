    "intro": "Dioscorea mexicana, commonly known as Mexican yam, is a climbing vine native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part of the plant. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and elongated, yellowish fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and twining. Dioscorea mexicana is valued not only for its edible tubers but also for its traditional use in herbal medicine."
