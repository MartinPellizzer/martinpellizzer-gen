    "intro": "Draba physocarpa var. fedtschenkoi, commonly known as the mountain mouse-ear cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens due to its compact growth habit and early spring blooms."
