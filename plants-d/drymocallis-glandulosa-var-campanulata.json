    "intro": "Drymocallis glandulosa var. campanulata, commonly known as the showy goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of bright yellow to orange inflorescences, which are especially prominent in the fall. The plant produces small, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in moist to wet soils in full sun, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This species plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, during the late summer and early autumn seasons."
