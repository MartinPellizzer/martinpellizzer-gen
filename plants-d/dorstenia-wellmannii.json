    "intro": "Dorstenia wellmannii, commonly known as the African mountain cucumber, is a climbing plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often ribbed stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Dorstenia wellmannii is also notable for its ability to climb using tendrils, allowing it to reach sunlight in dense forest environments."
