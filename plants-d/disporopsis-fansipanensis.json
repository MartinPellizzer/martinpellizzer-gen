    "intro": "Disporopsis fansipanensis, commonly known as the Fansipan disporopsis, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Vietnam. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky slopes or in mountainous forests. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this unique botanical species."
