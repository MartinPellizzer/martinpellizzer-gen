It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are opposite and often have stipules, which are small, leaf-like structures at the base of the petiole. The flowers are usually bisexual and produce small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals."
