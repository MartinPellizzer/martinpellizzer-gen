    "intro": "Dolichos goetzei, commonly known as the Goetze's dolichos, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa. It produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are often hairy. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields. The seeds are enclosed within the pods and can be dispersed by wind or animals."
