    "intro": "Draba depressa var. meyeri, commonly known as the Meyer's bentweed, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, dark green leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. It has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in rocky or sandy soils. This variety is often found in mountainous areas and is adapted to withstand extreme weather conditions."
