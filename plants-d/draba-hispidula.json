    "intro": "Draba hispidula, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant typically has basal leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It produces small white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Draba hispidula thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
