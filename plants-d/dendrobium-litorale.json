It is characterized by its erect, branching stems that often bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines, where it thrives in humid, saline environments. Its flowers, which range in color from white to yellow, are often borne on elongated inflorescences. Dendrobium litorale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
