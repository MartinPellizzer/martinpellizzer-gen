    "intro": "Distictella lutescens, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are typically succulent and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Distictella lutescens thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. It is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability."
