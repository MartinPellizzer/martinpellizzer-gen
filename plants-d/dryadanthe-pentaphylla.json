    "intro": "Dryadanthe pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-leaf lily, is a striking member of the orchid family native to the high elevations of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
