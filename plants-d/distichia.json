It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, where each flower head is composed of two opposite branches, each bearing a series of small florets. The leaves are typically linear and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Distichia species are native to various regions of the world, including Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their drought-resistant features."
