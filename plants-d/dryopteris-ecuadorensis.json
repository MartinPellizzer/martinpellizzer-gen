    "intro": "Dryopteris ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuador fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the Andes of Ecuador. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
