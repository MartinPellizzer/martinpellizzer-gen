    "intro": "Diasperus cladotrichus, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces strobila, which are cone-like structures that bear sporangia for spore production. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky soils. Diasperus cladotrichus is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for microorganisms."
