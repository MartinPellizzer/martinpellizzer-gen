    "intro": "Dryopteris subdimorpha, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive pattern of pinnae that vary in shape and size. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique, linear pattern on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
