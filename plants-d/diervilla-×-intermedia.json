It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features narrow, upright stems with small, deciduous leaves that turn red in the fall. Its most distinctive feature is its clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in USDA zones 4 to 8."
