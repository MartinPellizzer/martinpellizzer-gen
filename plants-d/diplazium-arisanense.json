    "intro": "Diplazium arisanense, commonly known as the Arisan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with floating leaves that are divided into fine, thread-like segments. Its fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Diplazium arisanense plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
