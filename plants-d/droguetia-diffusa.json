    "intro": "Droguetia diffusa, commonly known as the creeping roseroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with fleshy, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a waxy texture and a distinct scent when crushed. Droguetia diffusa is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
