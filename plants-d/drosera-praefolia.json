    "intro": "Drosera praefolia, commonly known as the early Drosera or the early sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insect prey. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in the morning. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wetlands. Drosera praefolia is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
