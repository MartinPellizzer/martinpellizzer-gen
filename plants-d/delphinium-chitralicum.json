    "intro": "Delphinium chitralicum, commonly known as the Chitral larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas, particularly in Pakistan and India. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The plant belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy blooms and often toxic properties. Its leaves are deeply divided and resemble those of other larkspur species, with a serrated edge. Delphinium chitralicum thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
