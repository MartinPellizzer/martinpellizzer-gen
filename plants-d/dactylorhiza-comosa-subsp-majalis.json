    "intro": "Dactylorhiza comosa subsp. majalis, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist, calcareous soils. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single or few flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its flowers are characterized by a narrow, hood-like labellum and are often pollinated by bees and other insects. The species is relatively rare and is protected in some regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
