    "intro": "Desmodium incanum f. obovatifolium, commonly known as the woolly ticktrefoil, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its soft, grayish foliage and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves with obovate leaflets, and it produces small, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. Due to its drought tolerance and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
