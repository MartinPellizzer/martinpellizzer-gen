    "intro": "Durabaculum fimbrilabium, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-green leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its unique morphology includes a short rhizome and a single, erect stem bearing several showy flowers. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
