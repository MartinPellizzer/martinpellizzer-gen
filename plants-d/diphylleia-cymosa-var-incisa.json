    "intro": "Diphylleia cymosa var. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf diphylleia, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, dark green foliage with a leathery texture, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
