    "intro": "Dendrobium petrophilum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in rocky habitats, often growing on cliffs or among limestone formations. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns that attract pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
