    "intro": "Diphryllum convallarioides, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries in the fall. It prefers moist, acidic soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant for woodland gardens. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to native plant collections."
