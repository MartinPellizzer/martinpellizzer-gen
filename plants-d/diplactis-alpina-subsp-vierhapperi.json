    "intro": "Diplactis alpina subsp. vierhapperi, commonly known as the Alpine Diplactis, is a rare and endemic plant species found in high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is a perennial herb with a rosette growth form, characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting specific pollinators. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
