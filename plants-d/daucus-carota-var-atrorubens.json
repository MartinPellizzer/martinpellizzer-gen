    "intro": "Daucus carota var. atrorubens, commonly known as the black-rooted carrot, is a variant of the common carrot characterized by its dark red or nearly black roots. This plant belongs to the Apiaceae family and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. Its roots are typically shorter and more robust compared to the standard carrot, with a deep, intense coloration. The leaves are finely divided and resemble those of the common carrot, though they may be slightly more hairy. This variety is often cultivated for its unique appearance and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
