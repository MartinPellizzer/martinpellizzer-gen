    "intro": "Dendrobium montedeakinense, commonly known as the Montedeakin orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like stems and clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale green flowers. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species under Australian conservation laws."
