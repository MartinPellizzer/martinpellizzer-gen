    "intro": "Desmoncus dasyacanthus, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, succulent stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by vibrant, showy bracts that attract pollinators. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
