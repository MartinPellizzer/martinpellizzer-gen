    "intro": "Digitalis lutea subsp. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic foxglove, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of western Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along sea cliffs and dunes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are pollinated primarily by bumblebees. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to coastal environments."
