    "intro": "Dendrobium greenianum, commonly known as the Greenian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, pendant-like inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, green, and white. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Dendrobium greenianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
