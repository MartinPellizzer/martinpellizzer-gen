    "intro": "Dactylorhiza traunsteineri subsp. francis-drucei, commonly known as the Francis-Druce's marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to western Europe. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, stout rhizome and produces a single, erect stem bearing a few flowers. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow with dark brown markings, and the plant thrives in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and fen meadows. It is classified as a protected species due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique floral morphology and genetic differences from other Dactylorhiza species."
