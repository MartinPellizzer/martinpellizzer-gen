    "intro": "Drepanocarpus discolor, commonly known as the white ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
