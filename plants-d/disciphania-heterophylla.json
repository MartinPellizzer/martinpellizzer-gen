    "intro": "Disciphania heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaved disciphania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which can range from ovate to linear, depending on environmental conditions. Its small, pale yellow flowers are typically clustered in racemes and bloom during the warmer months. Disciphania heterophylla is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
