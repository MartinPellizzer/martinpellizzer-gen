    "intro": "Drosera bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its small, white flowers bloom in spring, and it is often found in coastal regions. Drosera bequaertii is a hardy species that can tolerate periods of drought once established."
