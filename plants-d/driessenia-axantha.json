    "intro": "Driessenia axantha, commonly known as the Brazilian flame tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking, flame-like orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a deciduous habit, shedding its leaves during the dry season, and features a straight, smooth trunk with a reddish-brown bark. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a leathery texture, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Driessenia axantha is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates."
