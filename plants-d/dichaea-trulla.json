    "intro": "Dichaea trulla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, ghost-like appearance and lack of leaves, relying entirely on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in wetlands. Its flowers bloom in late spring, producing a unique, fragrant scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Dichaea trulla is listed as an endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
