    "intro": "Dryopteris gracilescens var. chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese maidenhair fern, is a species native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is a fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and have a graceful appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive silvery-white underside that adds to its ornamental value."
