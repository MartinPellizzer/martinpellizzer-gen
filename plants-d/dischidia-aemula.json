It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and unique aerial roots that help it cling to surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by elongated, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and scientific study."
