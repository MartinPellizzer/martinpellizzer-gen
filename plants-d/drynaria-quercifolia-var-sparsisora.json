    "intro": "Drynaria quercifolia var. sparsisora, commonly known as the sparse-leaf tree fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of pinnate fronds that are relatively sparse compared to the typical variety. The fronds are dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to the plant's ornamental appeal. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. This variant is valued for its unique foliage and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant."
