    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. fallax, commonly known as fallax tall fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, two-lobed spikelets. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in pastures and erosion control. Its tolerance to drought and grazing makes it a valuable forage crop."
