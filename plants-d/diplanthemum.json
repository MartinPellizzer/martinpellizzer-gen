    "intro": "Diplanthemum, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white or pale pink petals. The leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette, and are often covered in fine hairs. Diplanthemum species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. They play a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
