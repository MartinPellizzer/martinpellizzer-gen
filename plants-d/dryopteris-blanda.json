    "intro": "Dryopteris blanda, commonly known as the shield fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It features a rosette of lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, upright, spore-bearing cones called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
