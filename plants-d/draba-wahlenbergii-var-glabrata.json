    "intro": "Draba wahlenbergii var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features small, basal rosettes of glossy, dark green leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in tight, terminal inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
