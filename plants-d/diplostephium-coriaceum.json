    "intro": "Diplostephium coriaceum, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy inflorescences. The plant has alternate, rough-textured, ovate leaves with a waxy coating, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert or semi-arid regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a landscape plant in arid climates."
