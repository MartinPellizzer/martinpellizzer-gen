    "intro": "Didissandra rufa, commonly known as the red-stemmed didissandra, is a unique member of the Araliaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive red-brown stems and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces berries that transition from green to red as they mature, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice among gardeners in temperate climates."
