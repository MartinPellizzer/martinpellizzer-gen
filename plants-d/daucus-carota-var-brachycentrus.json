It is characterized by its short, stubby root and compact growth habit, making it distinct from the standard carrot variety. Botanically, it belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic and edible plants. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in umbels. It is primarily cultivated for its edible root, though it is less commonly grown than the standard carrot."
