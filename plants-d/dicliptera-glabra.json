    "intro": "Dicliptera glabra, commonly known as smooth dicliptera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. Dicliptera glabra is often found in moist or wet habitats such as marshes and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and potential for use in phytoremediation."
