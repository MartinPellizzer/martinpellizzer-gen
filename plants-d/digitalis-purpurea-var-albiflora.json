    "intro": "Digitalis purpurea var. albiflora, commonly known as the white foxglove, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely hairy stems that bear clusters of tubular, white flowers with prominent purple markings. The plant produces heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically dark green in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or shaded gardens. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
