    "intro": "Dryopteris mollissima, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern characterized by its soft, velvety fronds. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure that gives the plant its delicate appearance. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
