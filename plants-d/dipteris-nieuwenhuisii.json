    "intro": "Dipteris nieuwenhuisii, commonly known as the New Guinea water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Dipteridaceae and is characterized by its floating, leathery fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as marshes and slow-moving streams. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its fronds. Dipteris nieuwenhuisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
