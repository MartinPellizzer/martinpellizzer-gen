    "intro": "Delphinium maximowiczii, commonly known as the Siberian larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Delphinium maximowiczii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for alpine gardens. It is also notable for its toxic alkaloids, which make it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
