    "intro": "Diplusodon ramosissimus var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive thornapple, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its branched stems and showy, yellow-orange flowers that resemble those of other toxic species, potentially leading to misidentification. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by local wildlife. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is adapted to seasonal droughts. Due to its appearance and potential for confusion with poisonous plants, caution is advised when handling or consuming this species."
