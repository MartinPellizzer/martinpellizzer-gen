    "intro": "Dryopteris levingei, commonly known as the Levinge's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
