    "intro": "Dysosmia hastata, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, which bloom in late summer. Dysosmia hastata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
