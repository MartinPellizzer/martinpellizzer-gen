    "intro": "Dimorpha, commonly known as the two-faced plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features two distinct faces or lobes on each flower. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with aromatic leaves that have a resinous scent. Dimorpha species are often found in coastal or sandy soils, and they play a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they are not widely commercially grown."
