    "intro": "Danthonia spicata var. compressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, compressed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens for its hardiness and ecological benefits."
