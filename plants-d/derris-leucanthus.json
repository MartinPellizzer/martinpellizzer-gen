    "intro": "Derris leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered derris, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Leguminosae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is notable for its milky sap, which contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, and it produces long, slender pods that contain seeds. Despite its toxicity, it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
