The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its foliage is characterized by a waxy, glossy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. Delphinium viridiovarium is also notable for its toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
