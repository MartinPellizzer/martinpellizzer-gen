    "intro": "Dendrobium orbilobulatum, commonly known as the orbilobulate dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
