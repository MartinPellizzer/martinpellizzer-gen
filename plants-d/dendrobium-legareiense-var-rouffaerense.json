    "intro": "Dendrobium legareiense var. rouffaerense, commonly known as the Rouffaer's Dendrobium, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features long, cane-like stems with clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted for efficient water absorption in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
