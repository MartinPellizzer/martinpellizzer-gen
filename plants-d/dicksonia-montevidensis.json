    "intro": "Dicksonia montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevidense tree fern, is a species native to South America, particularly found in Uruguay and parts of Brazil. It is a large, evergreen tree fern characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a distinctive, hollow stem that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, making it a striking feature in its natural habitat. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting pollinators at night. This species plays an important ecological role in its environment, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
