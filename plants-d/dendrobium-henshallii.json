    "intro": "Dendrobium henshallii, commonly known as the Henshall's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in its tropical environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or green with red or purple markings, and they bloom in summer. Dendrobium henshallii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique and long-lasting blooms."
