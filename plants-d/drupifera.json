    "intro": "Drupifera, commonly known as a type of fruit-bearing plant, is characterized by its drupes, which are fleshy fruits with a hard pit or stone inside. These plants typically belong to the\u8537\u8587\u79d1 (Rosaceae) family and include species such as peaches, cherries, and plums. The botanical structure of drupes consists of an outer fleshy exocarp, a middle fleshy mesocarp, and a hard endocarp that encloses the seed. Drupifera plants are often deciduous, shedding their leaves seasonally, and they rely on animals for seed dispersal through their attractive fruits. Their growth habits and fruit structures make them important in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
