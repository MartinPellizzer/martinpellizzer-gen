    "intro": "Didymoglossum tahitense, commonly known as the Tahitian moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, greenish-yellow foliage. The plant lacks true roots and instead has rhizoids that anchor it to substrates like soil or rocks. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, including the Pacific islands. Due to its delicate structure, it is typically a short-lived plant with a limited geographic distribution."
