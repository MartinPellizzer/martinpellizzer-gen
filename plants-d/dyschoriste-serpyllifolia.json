    "intro": "Dyschoriste serpyllifolia, commonly known as creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can colonize rocky or sandy soils. Dyschoriste serpyllifolia is often found in dry grasslands, coastal areas, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun."
