    "intro": "Dryopteris erythrosora, commonly known as the red fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green fronds that turn a striking red or reddish-brown during the winter months. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the spring. The red fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
