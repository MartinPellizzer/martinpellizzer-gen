It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by tuberous roots that are often used in traditional medicine. Its tubers are also edible when properly cooked and are valued for their nutritional content. Dioscorea crinita thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
