    "intro": "Disticholiparis arcuata, commonly known as the spiral leaf fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features elongated, leathery fronds that curl into a spiral shape, giving it a striking appearance. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns."
