    "intro": "Dipholis contrerasii, commonly known as the Contreras's spider orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, thread-like petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small, with a distinctive coloration that aids in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
