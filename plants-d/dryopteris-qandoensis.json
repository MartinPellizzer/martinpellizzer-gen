    "intro": "Dryopteris qandoensis, commonly known as the Qando fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. The Qando fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
