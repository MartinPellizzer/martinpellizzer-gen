    "intro": "Darcya reliquiarum, commonly known as the sacred relic fern, is a rare and ancient plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that shimmer with a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing on rocky outcrops or in dense forest canopies. Its unique ability to absorb and store atmospheric moisture makes it an essential component of its ecosystem. Due to its mystical appearance and ecological significance, it is highly valued in both traditional medicine and conservation efforts."
