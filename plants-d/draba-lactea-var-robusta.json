    "intro": "Draba lactea var. robusta, commonly known as the robust milk vetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and arctic environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
