    "intro": "Dryopteris barbigera, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually divided into segments with a feathery appearance, and the spores are produced on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
