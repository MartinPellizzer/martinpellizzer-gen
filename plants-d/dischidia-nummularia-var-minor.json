    "intro": "Dischidia nummularia var. minor, commonly known as the miniature dollar plant, is a compact, trailing vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically bright green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It is well-suited for hanging baskets or as a trailing plant in shaded areas. Its low maintenance and ability to thrive in humid conditions make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
