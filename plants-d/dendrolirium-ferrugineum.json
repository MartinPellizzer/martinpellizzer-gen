It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and produces delicate, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive red or orange stripe along the dorsal sepal. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
