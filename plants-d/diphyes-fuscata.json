It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its roots can help prevent soil erosion, making it an important species in riparian habitats."
