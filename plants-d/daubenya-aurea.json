    "intro": "Daubenya aurea, commonly known as the golden dwarf lily, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from yellow to orange in color. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 18 inches and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Daubenya aurea is also noted for its ability to bloom reliably in late spring to early summer."
