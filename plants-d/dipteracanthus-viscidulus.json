    "intro": "Dipteracanthus viscidulus, commonly known as the sticky thornplant, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in a sticky, resinous substance that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The sticky resin has been used traditionally in some regions for medicinal purposes."
