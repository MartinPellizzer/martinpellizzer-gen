    "intro": "Dryopteris rosthornii, commonly known as the Rosthorn wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
