    "intro": "Dendrobium seidenfadenii, commonly known as the Siam orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, long-lasting flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a dark throat. It requires bright, indirect light and a well-draining potting medium to thrive. Dendrobium seidenfadenii is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
