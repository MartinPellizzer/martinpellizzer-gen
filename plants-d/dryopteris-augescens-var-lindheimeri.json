    "intro": "Dryopteris augescens var. lindheimeri, commonly known as Lindheimer's wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It features a robust rhizome system that supports its upright,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit. The fronds are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture and a glossy appearance. It produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to moist, shaded environments."
