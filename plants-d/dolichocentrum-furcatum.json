    "intro": "Dolichocentrum furcatum, commonly known as the forked cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, branching stems that resemble the shape of a fork, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the warmer months, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Dolichocentrum furcatum is well adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and extreme temperatures."
