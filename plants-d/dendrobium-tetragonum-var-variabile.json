    "intro": "Dendrobium tetragonum var. variabile, commonly known as the Variable Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features clustered, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical climates. Its flowers are typically yellow or green with red or purple markings, blooming in summer. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive."
