It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed soils, often forming dense stands. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow panicle with spikelets that are loosely arranged. Diplachne hackelii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
