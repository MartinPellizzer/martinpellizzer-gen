It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, toothed leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are hairy and rise above the foliage, bearing several flowers along their length. Dentaria trifida is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
