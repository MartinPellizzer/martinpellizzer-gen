It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale green flowers. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
