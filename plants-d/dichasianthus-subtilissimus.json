The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are typically elliptical and covered in a fine, silvery down, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
