It features small, rounded, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a bright, glossy green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by tiny, bladder-like fruits that contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens. Its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions enhances its adaptability in various landscapes."
