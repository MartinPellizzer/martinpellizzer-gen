    "intro": "Drudeophytum hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's drudeophytum, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep red. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
