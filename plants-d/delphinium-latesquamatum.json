It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs.
