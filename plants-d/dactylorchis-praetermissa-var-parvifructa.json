    "intro": "Dactylorchis praetermissa var. parvifructa, commonly known as the small-fruited fairy orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white to pale yellow flowers, which are often overlooked due to their size and color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. The species is considered endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
