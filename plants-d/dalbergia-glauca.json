    "intro": "Dalbergia glauca, commonly known as the bluebean or bluewood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, bluish-gray bark and trifoliate leaves with rounded lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland and montane forests. Dalbergia glauca is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and carving."
