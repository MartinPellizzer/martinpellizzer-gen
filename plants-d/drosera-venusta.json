    "intro": "Drosera venusta, commonly known as the velvet leaf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically dark green with a velvety texture, and it produces small, white or pink flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires high humidity to flourish. Drosera venusta is a popular specimen for cultivation due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
