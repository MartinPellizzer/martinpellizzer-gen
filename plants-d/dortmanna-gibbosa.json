    "intro": "Dortmanna gibbosa, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching structure and the presence of specialized bladder-like structures called bladder cells. These bladders are used to trap small aquatic organisms, which the plant then absorbs for nutrition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are small, rounded, and often lack true roots, instead relying on rhizoids for anchorage."
