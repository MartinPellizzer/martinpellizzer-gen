    "intro": "Dactylorchis baltica, commonly known as the Baltic twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that bears a single flower, which is usually greenish-yellow in color. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Dactylorchis baltica is characterized by its small, delicate appearance and its preference for cool, humid environments."
