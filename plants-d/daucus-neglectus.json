    "intro": "Daucus neglectus, commonly known as the wild carrot or bishop's crown, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is a biennial or perennial herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and open areas. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed structure that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Daucus neglectus is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
