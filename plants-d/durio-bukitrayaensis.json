    "intro": "Durio bukitrayaensis, commonly known as the Bukitraya durian, is a rare and endemic species native to the highland regions of Peninsular Malaysia. This plant belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, spiky fruit that matures to a golden-yellow color. The tree typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom before the fruit develops. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a smooth surface and a strong, aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Durio bukitrayaensis is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
