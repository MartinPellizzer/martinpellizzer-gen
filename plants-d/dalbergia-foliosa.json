    "intro": "Dalbergia foliosa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or Brazilian walnut, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its ornamental value due to its attractive, compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with a dense canopy and a spreading habit. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and durability, though it is also known for its ecological importance in tropical forests. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
