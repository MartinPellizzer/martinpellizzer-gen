    "intro": "Draba lasiophylla var. nubigena, commonly known as the cloud cushion sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of the European Alps. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, typically between June and August. Its leaves are tightly packed and covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is notable for its ability to survive in high-altitude habitats where few other plants can grow."
