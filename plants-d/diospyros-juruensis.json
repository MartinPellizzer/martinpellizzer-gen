    "intro": "Diospyros juruensis, commonly known as the Juruense persimmon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ebenaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit is a smooth, round berry that turns from green to orange-red when ripe. The tree is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of tannins."
