    "intro": "Dianthus stellaris, commonly known as the star pink, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces small, rounded seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Dianthus stellaris is also valued for its fragrant foliage and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
