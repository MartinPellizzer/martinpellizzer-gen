    "intro": "Dendrobium munificum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the summer months. Its stems are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native tropical environment. Dendrobium munificum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
