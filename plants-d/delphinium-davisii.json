It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense spikes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with lobed or trifoliate divisions, and are typically arranged alternately along the stem.
