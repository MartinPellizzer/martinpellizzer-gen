It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves that are opposite and lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical and subtropical regions."
