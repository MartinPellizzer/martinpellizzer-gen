    "intro": "Dolicholus, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and showy, often fragrant flowers. These plants are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or other structures without being parasitic. Dolicholus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Their botanical significance lies in their unique morphology and ecological role in diverse forest ecosystems."
