    "intro": "Doria semicalva, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with pale veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate. Doria semicalva is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
