It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. Its roots contain the alkaloid rotenone, which has been traditionally used as a natural insecticide. Derris micans is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands."
