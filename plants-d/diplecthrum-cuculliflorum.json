    "intro": "Diplecthrum cuculliflorum, commonly known as the hooded waterflag, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving waters in Africa and Asia. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes and produce floating or submerged leaves. The plant's most distinctive characteristic is its unique, hood-like inflorescence, which consists of small, greenish-white flowers. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
