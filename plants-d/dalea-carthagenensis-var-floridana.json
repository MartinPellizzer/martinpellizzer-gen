    "intro": "Dalea carthagenensis var. floridana, commonly known as Florida milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils, often in open woodlands or along roadsides. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and native landscaping."
