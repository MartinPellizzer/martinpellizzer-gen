It is native to the mountainous regions of the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada. The plant is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are large and showy, typically blue to purple in color, with elongated sepals that are often mistaken for petals. Delphinium macrotepalum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
