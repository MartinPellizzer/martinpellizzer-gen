    "intro": "Diplostephium anactinotum, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its erect stem and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds, and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for certain pollinators, though it is not a major food source for most insects."
