    "intro": "Dracaena reflexa var. brevifolia, commonly known as the Song of India, is a compact, upright shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features dark green, strap-like leaves that are shorter and broader than those of other Dracaena species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental foliage. It is highly tolerant of low light and requires minimal watering, making it a popular indoor plant. Its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions contribute to its widespread use in both residential and commercial settings."
