It is native to various regions of Africa and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plants typically have opposite or whorled leaves and produce milky sap, which can be toxic. Discocleidion species are often found in dry, open habitats and are adapted to arid conditions. They play a role in local ecosystems and have been used in traditional medicine in some areas."
