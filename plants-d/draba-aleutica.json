    "intro": "Draba aleutica, commonly known as Aleutian sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered with fine hairs to reduce water loss. Draba aleutica plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
