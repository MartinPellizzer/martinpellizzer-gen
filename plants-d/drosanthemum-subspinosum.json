    "intro": "Drosanthemum subspinosum, commonly known as the spiny drosanthemum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, known for its succulent characteristics and ability to store water in its fleshy leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically spiny and covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
