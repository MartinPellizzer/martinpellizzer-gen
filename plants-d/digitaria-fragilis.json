    "intro": "Digitaria fragilis, commonly known as brittlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of tiny, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
