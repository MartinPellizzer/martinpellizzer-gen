    "intro": "Delphinium pavonaceum, commonly known as the peacock larkspur, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of vivid blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five sepals and five petals, and are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Delphinium pavonaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal but is toxic due to the presence of alkaloids."
