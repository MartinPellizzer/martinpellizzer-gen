    "intro": "Danthonia tsaratananensis, commonly known as the Tsaratanana grass, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, blade-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
