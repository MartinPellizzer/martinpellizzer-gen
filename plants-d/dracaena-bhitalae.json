It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually a deep green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red or orange-colored fruits.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
