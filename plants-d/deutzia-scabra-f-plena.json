It features showy, rounded clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has slender, arching stems and small, ovate leaves with a smooth texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and foundation plantings. Its ornamental value lies in its abundant, delicate blooms and its ability to provide seasonal interest in the landscape."
