    "intro": "Dipteracanthus viscidulus var. abortivus, commonly known as the sticky bladder fern, is a variant of the sticky bladder fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and the presence of sticky secretions on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, viscous substance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in tropical rainforests. The varietal distinction of var. abortivus is primarily based on subtle differences in leaf morphology and the degree of stickiness observed in its foliage."
