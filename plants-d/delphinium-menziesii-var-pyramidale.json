    "intro": "Delphinium menziesii var. pyramidale, commonly known as the pyramid bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features tall, upright stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with dense clusters of sky-blue to lavender-colored flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, basal leaves that are hairy and often covered in fine white hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it a striking addition to woodland gardens. Its botanical interest lies in its unique floral structure and its role as a food source for certain pollinators."
