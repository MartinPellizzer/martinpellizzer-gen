    "intro": "Daphne tarton-raira var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf daphne, is a species native to the Canary Islands. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers appear in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
