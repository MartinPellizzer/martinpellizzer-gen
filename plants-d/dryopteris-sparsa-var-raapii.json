    "intro": "Dryopteris sparsa var. raapii, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a variant of the sparse wood fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and light conditions."
