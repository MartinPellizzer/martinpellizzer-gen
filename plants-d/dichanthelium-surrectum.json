    "intro": "Dichanthelium surrectum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandreed, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and dunes. Dichanthelium surrectum plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
