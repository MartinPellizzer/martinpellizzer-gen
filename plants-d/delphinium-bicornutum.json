    "intro": "Delphinium bicornutum, commonly known as the two-horned larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in racemes, with each bloom featuring two prominent, horn-like sepals. Its foliage consists of basal and alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped and hairy. Delphinium bicornutum prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens."
