    "intro": "Draba saxatilis, commonly known as the saxatile whitlowgrass, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and a compact inflorescence of yellow flowers. Native to alpine and rocky environments in Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its spread in harsh habitats. Its ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions makes it an important component of mountain ecosystems."
