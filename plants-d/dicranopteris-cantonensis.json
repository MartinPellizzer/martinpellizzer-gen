    "intro": "Dicranopteris cantonensis, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on cliffs or in rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Dicranopteris cantonensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
