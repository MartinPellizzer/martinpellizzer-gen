It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated for horticultural purposes in many regions."
