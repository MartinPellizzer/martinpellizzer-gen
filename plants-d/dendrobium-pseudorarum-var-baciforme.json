    "intro": "Dendrobium pseudorarum var. baciforme, commonly known as the twisted form of the rare pseudorarum dendrobium, is a unique orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spirally twisted stems that resemble a helix, which is a distinctive feature among orchids. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unusual morphology and ornamental value."
