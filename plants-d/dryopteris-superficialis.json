    "intro": "Dryopteris superficialis, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance."
