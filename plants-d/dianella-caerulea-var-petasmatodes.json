    "intro": "Dianella caerulea var. petasmatodes, commonly known as the broad-leaf spoon-plant, is a striking evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often a deep blue-green color, with a waxy texture that gives them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by edible, black, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ability to attract native birds and insects."
