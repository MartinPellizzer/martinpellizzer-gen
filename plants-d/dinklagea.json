    "intro": "Dinklagea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lauraceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. The plants are characterized by their aromatic leaves and small, fragrant flowers. They typically grow in tropical rainforests and are valued for their hard, durable wood. However, due to overharvesting, many species within this genus are now endangered."
