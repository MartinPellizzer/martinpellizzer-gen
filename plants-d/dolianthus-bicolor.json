    "intro": "Dolianthus bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored flax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking bi-colored flowers, which typically feature a white or pale pink center surrounded by a deeper pink or red outer edge. The plant produces slender, erect stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dolianthus bicolor is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
