    "intro": "Diacisperma, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a distinguishing feature. Diacisperma species are often found in desert environments, where they play a role in supporting local pollinators."
