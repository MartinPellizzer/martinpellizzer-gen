    "intro": "Diodia teres, commonly known as white snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small white flowers. The plant contains toxic compounds, particularly tremetol, which can be harmful to livestock and humans if ingested. It often grows in moist, wooded areas and is sometimes found in pastures. Despite its toxicity, it plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its chemical properties."
