    "intro": "Didymoglossum wallii, commonly known as the wall's hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like vegetation with slender, hair-like leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its delicate structure and ecological role in stabilizing soil make it an important component of certain ecosystems."
