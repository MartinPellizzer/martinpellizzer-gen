    "intro": "Dorstenia ophiocoma var. stipulata, commonly known as the \"Cushion Fig\" or \"Cushion Plant,\" is a unique member of the Moraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, with numerous small, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden within the leaf axils. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white to grayish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This species is native to parts of Africa and is often cultivated for its ornamental appearance and resilience in dry conditions."
