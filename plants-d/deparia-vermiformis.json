    "intro": "Deparia vermiformis, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
