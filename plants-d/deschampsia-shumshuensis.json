    "intro": "Deschampsia shumshuensis, commonly known as Shumshu grass, is a rare and endemic species native to the Shumshu Island in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in cold, coastal environments with poor soil conditions. The plant typically forms dense tufts with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
