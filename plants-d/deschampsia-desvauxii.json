It typically grows in rocky, open habitats such as alpine meadows and slopes. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with fine, blue-green blades that are often covered in a powdery bloom. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spikelet with small, spike-like flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
