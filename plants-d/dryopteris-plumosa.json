    "intro": "Dryopteris plumosa, commonly known as the silky fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, elegant appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, creating a finely divided, lace-like structure. Dryopteris plumosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
