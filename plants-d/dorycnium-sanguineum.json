It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and is often found in disturbed soils or along woodland edges. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, enriching the soil. The seeds are enclosed in hairy pods and are typically dispersed by wind or animals."
