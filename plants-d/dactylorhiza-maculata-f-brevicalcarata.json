    "intro": "Dactylorhiza maculata f. brevicalcarata, commonly known as the spotted marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and pale green to brownish leaves, which are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow or greenish flowers with a distinct, fragrant scent. It thrives in wet, boggy habitats and requires specific conditions for successful growth. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
