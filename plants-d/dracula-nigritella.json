    "intro": "Dracula nigritella, commonly known as the Black Dracula orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its dark, velvety leaves and dramatic, hooded flowers that resemble the mythical creature Dracula. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Dracula nigritella is also noted for its specific pollination mechanisms, which involve certain species of flies."
