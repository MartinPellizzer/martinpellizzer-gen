    "intro": "Dimorphotheca ecklonis, commonly known as the Cape marigold, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white or pale pink petals. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salt spray. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread along the coastline. Dimorphotheca ecklonis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
