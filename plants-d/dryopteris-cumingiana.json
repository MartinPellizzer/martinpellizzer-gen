    "intro": "Dryopteris cumingiana, commonly known as the Cuming's wood fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into a series of pinnae, which are further subdivided into smaller segments called pinnules. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in structures called sori."
