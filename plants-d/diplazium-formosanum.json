    "intro": "Diplazium formosanum, commonly known as the Taiwan sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin, membranous indusium. Diplazium formosanum thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is creeping and gives rise to the fronds, making it a common ground cover in its native habitat."
