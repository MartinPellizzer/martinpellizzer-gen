    "intro": "Diporidium greveanum var. macrosepalum, commonly known as the large-sepal diporidium, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring large, showy sepals that are often more prominent than the petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, highlighting its ecological niche within the ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
