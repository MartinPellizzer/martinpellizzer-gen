    "intro": "Delphinium oliganthum var. brachycentrum, commonly known as the short-stemmed larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which are typically arranged in racemes. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is characterized by its compact inflorescence and shorter floral stems compared to other delphinium species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
