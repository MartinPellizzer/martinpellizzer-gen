It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often at high altitudes. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, while its flowers are white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
