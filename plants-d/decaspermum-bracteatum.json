    "intro": "Decaspermum bracteatum, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves, which are typically oval and slightly serrated. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Decaspermum bracteatum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and shrublands."
