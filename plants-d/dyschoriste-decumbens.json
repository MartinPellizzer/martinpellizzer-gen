    "intro": "Dyschoriste decumbens, commonly known as the creeping dyschoriste, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are borne in clusters and bloom during the rainy season. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
