    "intro": "Dactylogramma, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, heart-shaped leaves, and showy yellow or orange flowers. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and water-storing tissues. Dactylogramma is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
