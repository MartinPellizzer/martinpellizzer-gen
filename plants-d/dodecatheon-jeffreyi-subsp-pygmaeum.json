    "intro": "Dodecatheon jeffreyi subsp. pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf jeffrey's glory-of-the-snow, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
