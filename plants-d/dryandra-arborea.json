    "intro": "Dryandra arborea, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a small evergreen shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded form and its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, woody pods that contain seeds. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of its native region. Dryandra arborea is also the floral emblem of Western Australia, symbolizing the state's natural heritage."
