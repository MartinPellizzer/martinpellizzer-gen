    "intro": "Dryopteris speciosa var. assamica, commonly known as the Assam Shield Fern, is a variant of the sword fern native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori."
