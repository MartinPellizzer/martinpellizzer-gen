It features a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb system that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are elliptical and arranged in two rows, contributing to its compact appearance. Dendrobium brassii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
