    "intro": "Deyeuxia leiopoda var. discreta, commonly known as the slender flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its fine, flat leaves and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for moist, shaded environments. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, waterlogged soils. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
