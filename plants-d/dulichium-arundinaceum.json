    "intro": "Dulichium arundinaceum, commonly known as common spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, ditches, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow with a rough, hairy texture. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lipped flowers. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
