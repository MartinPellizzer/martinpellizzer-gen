    "intro": "Dryopteris dentata var. inconstans, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is known for its variability in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its common name."
