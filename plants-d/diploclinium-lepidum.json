    "intro": "Diploclinium lepidum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or hairy diploclinium, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its stems are often hairy and can become woody with age, while its roots are fibrous and moderately deep. Diploclinium lepidum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks."
