It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and arranged spirally along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
