    "intro": "Dendrobium eymanum, commonly known as the Eymans' orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with branched, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium eymanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in cultivation."
