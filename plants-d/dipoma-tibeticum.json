It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
