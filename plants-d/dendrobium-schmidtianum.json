It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often in clusters. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in environments with irregular rainfall. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
