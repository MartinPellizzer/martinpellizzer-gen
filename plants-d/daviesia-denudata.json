The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are simple and alternate, often with a hairy texture, and it is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils. Daviesia denudata is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
