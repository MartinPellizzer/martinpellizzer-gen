    "intro": "Deyeuxia arundinacea var. collina, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
