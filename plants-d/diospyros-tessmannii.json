It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by round, fleshy fruits that turn from green to orange when mature. Its fruits are edible, though some varieties may have a mild astringent taste, and the tree is valued for its timber and ornamental qualities."
