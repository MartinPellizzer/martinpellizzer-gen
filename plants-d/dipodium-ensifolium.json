    "intro": "Dipodium ensifolium, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its sword-shaped, elongated leaves that are typically evergreen and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new fronds along their length. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance."
