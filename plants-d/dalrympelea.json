    "intro": "Dalrympelea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with long, slender leaves and a single, showy flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Dalrympelea is protected and considered a symbol of the region's biodiversity."
