    "intro": "Dichanthelium acuminatum var. sericeum, commonly known as silky grass or silky panicum, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a silky texture. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stem, with small, two-lobed glumes. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. This variety is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils."
