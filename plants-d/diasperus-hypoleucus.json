    "intro": "Diasperus hypoleucus, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Diasperus hypoleucus is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is known for its ecological importance to pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
