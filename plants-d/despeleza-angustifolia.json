    "intro": "Despeleza angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved despeleza, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
