    "intro": "Deyeuxia, commonly known as false rice, is a genus of grasses native to temperate and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plants are characterized by their slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. Deyeuxia species often have narrow, linear leaves and produce wind-pollinated flowers. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
