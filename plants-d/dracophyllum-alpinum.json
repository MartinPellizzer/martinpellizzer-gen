    "intro": "Dracophyllum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine dracophyllum, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions such as strong winds and low temperatures. Its small, leathery leaves are adapted for water conservation, and it produces fragrant, white or pale pink flowers in late summer. Dracophyllum alpinum is often found in rocky soils and is a component of alpine ecosystems in the Andes and Patagonia."
