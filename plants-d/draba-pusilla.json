    "intro": "Draba pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf whitlow grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It typically grows to a height of less than 5 centimeters, featuring a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow or white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Draba pusilla is adapted to harsh environments, with a short growing season and the ability to survive in poor soil conditions. Its compact size and resilience make it a characteristic species of high-altitude ecosystems."
