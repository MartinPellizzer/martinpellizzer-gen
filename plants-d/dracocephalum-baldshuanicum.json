    "intro": "Dracocephalum baldshuanicum, commonly known as the Tibetan bluehead, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and adjacent areas in China. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, opposite leaves, and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
