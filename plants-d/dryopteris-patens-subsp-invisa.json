    "intro": "Dryopteris patens subsp. invisa, commonly known as the invisible wood fern, is a fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically shorter and more slender than those of the typical variety. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is notable for its unique appearance and ecological role in woodland ecosystems."
