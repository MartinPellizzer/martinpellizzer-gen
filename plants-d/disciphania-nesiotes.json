    "intro": "Disciphania nesiotes, commonly known as the New Caledonian fern, is a unique species native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many epiphytic ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
