    "intro": "Davallia longifolia, commonly known as the feather fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and can produce new plants through spore propagation. The leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
