    "intro": "Dryopteris emigrans, commonly known as the emigrating wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, serrated edge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
