    "intro": "Dryadanthe pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf fairy lantern, is a small, flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, pale yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in shaded or woodland environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
