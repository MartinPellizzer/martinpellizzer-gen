    "intro": "Dryopteris guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupine wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically arching or pendulous. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and extensively branched, contributing to its ability to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
