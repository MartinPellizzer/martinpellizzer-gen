    "intro": "Descurainia torulosa, commonly known as the yellow rocket, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist soils along streambanks and wetlands, often forming dense colonies. Its flowers are small and clustered in racemes, and it produces elongated, slender pods that contain several seeds. Descurainia torulosa is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
