    "intro": "Doronicum macrophyllum subsp. sparsipilosum, commonly known as the woolly-leaved leopard's bane, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate leaves that are densely covered with silky, white hairs, giving it a distinctive woolly appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in terminal clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
