    "intro": "Dryopteris regnelliana, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and rocky areas. Dryopteris regnelliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens."
