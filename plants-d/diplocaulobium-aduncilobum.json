    "intro": "Diplocaulobium aduncilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed diplocaulobium, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
