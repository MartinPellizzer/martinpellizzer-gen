    "intro": "Dendrobium lyperanthiflorum, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with deep red veins contrasting against its white or pale pink petals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Dendrobium lyperanthiflorum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique floral display."
