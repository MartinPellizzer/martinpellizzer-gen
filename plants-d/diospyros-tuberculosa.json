    "intro": "Diospyros tuberculosa, commonly known as the rough-shelled ebony, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like fruit covering, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are usually alternate, simple, and have a rough or pubescent texture. The tree is valued for its hard, dark wood, which has been used traditionally for tool handles and decorative items."
