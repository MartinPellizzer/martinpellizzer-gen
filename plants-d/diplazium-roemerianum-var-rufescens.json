    "intro": "Diplazium roemerianum var. rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed sword fern, is a variant of the Diplazium genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a fern characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a reddish tint on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new growth, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that are arranged alternately along the rachis."
