It features small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, often in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn reddish in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Daphne koreana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and winter interest, with its stems remaining attractive even after the leaves fall."
