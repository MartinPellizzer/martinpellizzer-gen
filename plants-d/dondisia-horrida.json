    "intro": "Dondisia horrida, commonly known as the horrid dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant's stems are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a rough and spiny appearance. It is native to parts of Africa and is known for its ability to infest a variety of host species. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation."
