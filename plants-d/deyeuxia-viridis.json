    "intro": "Deyeuxia viridis, commonly known as the green false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained to slightly waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often green to bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Deyeuxia viridis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
