    "intro": "Dendrobium mesochlorum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking yellow and green flowers with a distinctive butterfly-like shape, which is a key feature in its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. The botanical characteristics of Dendrobium mesochlorum make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
