    "intro": "Dicranostyles integra, commonly known as the broad-leaved spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. Dicranostyles integra plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
