    "intro": "Draba platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited whitlow grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by rounded, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine, hairy structures. Draba platycarpa is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in harsh, high-altitude environments."
