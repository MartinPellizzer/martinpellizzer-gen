    "intro": "Diplazium speciosum, commonly known as the golden snake's head, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that form a dense, bushy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
