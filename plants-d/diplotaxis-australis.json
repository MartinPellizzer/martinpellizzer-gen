    "intro": "Diplotaxis australis, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in sandy or coastal soils. It is drought-tolerant and often found in coastal dunes and rocky areas. Diplotaxis australis plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and provides nectar for pollinators."
