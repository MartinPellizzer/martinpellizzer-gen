    "intro": "Drosera septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden dew to trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and wet heath environments. Its leaves are usually small and clustered at the base, forming a rosette structure. Drosera septentrionalis is an important indicator species for cold, moist habitats and plays a unique role in its ecosystem."
