    "intro": "Diplazium pullingeri var. pullingeri, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and contribute to its robust growth pattern. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators."
