    "intro": "Draba calcifuga, commonly known as the limestone rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky environments in Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically has basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate, and its flowering stems are often covered with fine hairs. Draba calcifuga thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale yellow, bloom in early spring, contributing to the early floral display in mountainous regions."
