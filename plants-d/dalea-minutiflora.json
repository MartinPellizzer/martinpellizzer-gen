    "intro": "Dalea minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of tiny, often inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are densely arranged along the stems. Dalea minutiflora is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
