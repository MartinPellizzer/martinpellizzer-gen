    "intro": "Dorstenia gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum dwarf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that open in the morning and close in the late afternoon. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found in rocky or gypsum-rich environments. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a waxy texture to reduce water loss. Dorstenia gypsophila is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
