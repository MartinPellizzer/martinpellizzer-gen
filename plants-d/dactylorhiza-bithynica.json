    "intro": "Dactylorhiza bithynica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is a perennial herb with a sympodial growth habit, characterized by a rhizome and a rosette of fleshy, narrow leaves. The plant produces a single, erect flowering stem that bears a spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. It thrives in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and fens, often in areas with high moisture and low light conditions. Dactylorhiza bithynica is known for its specialized mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for nutrient uptake in its nutrient-poor environment."
