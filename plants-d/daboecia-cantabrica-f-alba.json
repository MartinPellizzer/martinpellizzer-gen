    "intro": "Daboecia cantabrica f. alba, commonly known as the white rock rose, is a rare and striking variant of the rock rose species native to the coastal regions of northern Spain. This plant is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast sharply with its dark green, leathery leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal cliffs and heathlands. The plant is adapted to harsh maritime conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
