    "intro": "Dichapetalum scandens, commonly known as the climbing dichapetalum, is a tropical vine native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, simple leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny seeds. Dichapetalum scandens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
