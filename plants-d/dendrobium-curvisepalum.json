    "intro": "Dendrobium curvisepalum, commonly known as the curved-sepal orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple stems that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and well-draining potting media. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated for horticultural purposes and is sometimes threatened by over-collection in the wild."
