    "intro": "Dryopteris hirtipes var. atrata, commonly known as the black-stemmed wood fern, is a variant of the hairy wood fern native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its dark, almost black stems that contrast with its light green, pinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the undersides. The botanical features of this fern make it a distinctive and valuable species in both horticultural and ecological contexts."
