    "intro": "Dryopteris labordei var. simasakii, commonly known as the Simasakii wood fern, is a rare and distinctive variety of the wood fern genus. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled margin. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are arranged in a unique pattern along the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories in its native habitat. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sought after by horticulturists and botanists alike."
