    "intro": "Dryopteris kobayashii, commonly known as the Kobayashi's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It features a compact, upright growth habit with deeply divided, lance-shaped fronds that have a distinctive blackish-brown hue. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
