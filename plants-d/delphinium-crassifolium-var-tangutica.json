    "intro": "Delphinium crassifolium var. tangutica, commonly known as the Tibetan larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and adjacent areas. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine meadows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
