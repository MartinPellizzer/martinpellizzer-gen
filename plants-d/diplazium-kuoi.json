    "intro": "Diplazium kuoi, commonly known as the mountain brake, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
