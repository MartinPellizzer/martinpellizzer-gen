    "intro": "Domeykoa perennis, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its compact, dome-shaped growth habit and produces small, bright red berries that are a striking feature of the plant. The leaves are typically elliptical, glossy, and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. The plant's unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
