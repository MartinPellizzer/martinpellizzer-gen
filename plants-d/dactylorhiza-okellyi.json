    "intro": "Dactylorhiza okellyi, commonly known as the Kelly's marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic habitats such as bogs and wet meadows. The plant has a slender, erect stem with few leaves and produces spikes of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, a common adaptation in orchids. Dactylorhiza okellyi is part of the Orchidaceae family and is often found in association with other orchid species in its native environment."
