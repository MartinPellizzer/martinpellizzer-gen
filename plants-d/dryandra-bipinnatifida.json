It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces vibrant, cone-shaped inflorescences that bloom in spring, showcasing clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red and orange. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant collections.
