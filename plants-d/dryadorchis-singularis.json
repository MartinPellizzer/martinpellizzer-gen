    "intro": "Dryadorchis singularis, commonly known as the singular orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions with unique microclimates. It exhibits typical orchid characteristics, including a sympodial growth habit and a single, showy flower per stem. The plant's botanical features are adapted to its specific ecological niche, with specialized roots for nutrient absorption and a delicate, ephemeral bloom. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, contrasting with its more elaborate common name. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
