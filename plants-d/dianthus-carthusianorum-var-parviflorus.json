    "intro": "Dianthus carthusianorum var. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered carnation, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, bushy growth with narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant due to its hardy nature. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The plant's botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for both gardeners and botanists interested in its ornamental and ecological value."
