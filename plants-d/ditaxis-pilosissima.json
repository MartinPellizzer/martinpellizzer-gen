    "intro": "Ditaxis pilosissima, commonly known as the woolly bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish pubescence covering its stems and leaves, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
