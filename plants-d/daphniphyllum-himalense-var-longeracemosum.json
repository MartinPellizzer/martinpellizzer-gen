    "intro": "Daphniphyllum himalense var. longeracemosum, commonly known as the Himalayan silverleaf, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and Bhutan. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that is typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red berries in the autumn. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
