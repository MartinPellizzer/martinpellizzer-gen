    "intro": "Dentaria, commonly known as toothworts, are herbaceous perennial plants native to North America. They are characterized by their rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, tooth-like leaves that give the plant its common name. The flowers are typically white or pale pink and are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Dentaria species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. These plants play a role in soil stabilization and provide nectar for pollinators."
