    "intro": "Daemonorops melanochaetes var. macrocymbus, commonly known as the giant cycad or the Philippine cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
