    "intro": "Dracula incognita, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the air and soil. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of white and purple, are highly specialized for pollination by certain insects. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Dracula incognita is considered a critically endangered species."
