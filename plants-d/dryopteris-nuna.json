    "intro": "Dryopteris nuna, commonly known as the Nuna wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bronze to dark green in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in shaded forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, fan-like pattern. Dryopteris nuna is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
