    "intro": "Drosera basifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, sticky-hair covered leaves that trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically green with red or purple hues, and they secrete a mucilaginous substance to immobilize prey. It thrives in wet, acidic environments and is often found in swampy areas or heathlands. Drosera basifolia is a popular species among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and ease of cultivation."
