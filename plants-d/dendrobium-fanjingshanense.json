    "intro": "Dendrobium fanjingshanense, commonly known as the Fanjingshan orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in the spring, producing white or pale yellow flowers with a pleasant aroma. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
