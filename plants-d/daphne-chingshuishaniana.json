It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has glossy, ovate leaves that are dark green and provide a striking contrast to its delicate blossoms. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
