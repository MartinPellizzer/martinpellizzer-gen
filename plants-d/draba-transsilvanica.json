    "intro": "Draba transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clustered flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing small white or pale yellow flowers that are arranged in tight, compact inflorescences. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and have a distinctive glaucous appearance, often covered in a powdery coating. Draba transsilvanica is adapted to rocky and calcareous soils, making it a common sight in alpine and subalpine regions."
