    "intro": "Drypetes stipularis, commonly known as the scarlet tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical leaves that are opposite and have prominent stipules. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, edible seeds. The bark is smooth and grayish, while the wood is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks."
