    "intro": "Diarrhena festucoides, commonly known as slender false oat, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that bears small, inconspicuous flowers. Diarrhena festucoides is often found in low-nutrient soils and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
