    "intro": "Distephana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Distephana is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks due to its preference for moist soil. It is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
