    "intro": "Dasylirion cedrosanum, commonly known as Cedros Island sotol, is a succulent plant native to the coastal areas of Baja California, Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, blue-gray, strap-like leaves that are covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, greenish-white flowers, which are typically pollinated by wind. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves and stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
