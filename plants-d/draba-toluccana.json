    "intro": "Draba toluccana, commonly known as the Toluca whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and basal leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. It produces small, yellow or white flowers that bloom in early spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Draba toluccana is a hardy species adapted to cold climates and is often found in open, sunny areas."
