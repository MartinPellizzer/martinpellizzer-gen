    "intro": "Dysoxylum sericeum, commonly known as the silky dysoxylum, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark and lance-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
