    "intro": "Dendrobium aloifolium, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, narrow lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium aloifolium is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
