It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and coastal areas. Its succulent leaves help it store water, making it well adapted to dry conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in xerophytic landscapes."
