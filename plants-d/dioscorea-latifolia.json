    "intro": "Dioscorea latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf yam, is a tropical vine belonging to the Dioscoreaceae family. It is native to regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves and bears yellow flowers that develop into tuberous roots, which are its primary economic product. These tubers are used as a food source and have been traditionally utilized in various medicinal practices. Its growth habit involves climbing and twining around supporting structures, making it a characteristic feature of tropical undergrowth."
