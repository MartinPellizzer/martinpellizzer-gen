    "intro": "Delphinium samium, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, with a rough, hairy texture. Delphinium samium is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
