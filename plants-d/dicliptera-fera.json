    "intro": "Dicliptera fera, commonly known as the African grass or wild millet, is a tall, perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil, it plays an important role in ecological restoration projects."
