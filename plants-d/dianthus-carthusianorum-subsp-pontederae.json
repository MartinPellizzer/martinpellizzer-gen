    "intro": "Dianthus carthusianorum subsp. pontederae, commonly known as the Pontedera carnation, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, double pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more branched stems and smaller, more numerous petals compared to the typical D. carthusianorum. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its delicate, fragrant blooms."
