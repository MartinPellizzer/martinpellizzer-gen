    "intro": "Digitaria henrardii, commonly known as African ricegrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Digitaria henrardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
