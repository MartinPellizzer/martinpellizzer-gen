    "intro": "Draba reptans, commonly known as the creeping whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Draba reptans is known for its hardiness and ability to colonize disturbed or barren areas."
