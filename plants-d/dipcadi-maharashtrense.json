    "intro": "Dipcadi maharashtrense, commonly known as the Maharashtra lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the western Indian state of Maharashtra. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that support its growth and flowering cycle. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
