    "intro": "Draparnaudia, commonly known as the violet snail, is a genus of air-breathing land snails. These snails belong to the family Helicidae and are characterized by their spiral-shaped shells. They are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and gardens. The plants they interact with are often part of their habitat, providing shelter and food sources. Their presence can indicate a healthy ecosystem due to their sensitivity to environmental changes."
