    "intro": "Dissochaeta rostrata var. floccosa, commonly known as the woolly sand mat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features dense, soft, white to grayish pubescence covering its stems and leaves, giving it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of pink or white. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to withstand extreme temperatures and minimal water requirements."
