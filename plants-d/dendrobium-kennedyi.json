    "intro": "Dendrobium kennedyi, commonly known as the Kennedy's orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, warm climates with high light exposure. The plant produces striking, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall."
