It features slender, arching stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often finely toothed. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on the previous year's growth. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in garden settings."
