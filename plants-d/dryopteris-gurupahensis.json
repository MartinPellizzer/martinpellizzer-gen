    "intro": "Dryopteris gurupahensis, commonly known as the Gurupahensis Shield Fern, is a species of shield fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat."
