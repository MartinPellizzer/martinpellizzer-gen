    "intro": "Daphne penicillata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation. Daphne penicillata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and early seasonal display."
