It belongs to the Dendrobium genus, which is characterized by its terrestrial or epiphytic growth habit and often showy floral displays. The plant typically produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with red or orange markings, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
