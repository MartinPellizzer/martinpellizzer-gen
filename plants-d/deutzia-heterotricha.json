    "intro": "Deutzia heterotricha, commonly known as the Chinese deutzia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden landscaping. Its ornamental value comes from both its showy flowers and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
