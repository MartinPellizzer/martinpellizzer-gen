    "intro": "Debregeasia australis, commonly known as the Australian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves and produces small white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species and is protected in many regions."
