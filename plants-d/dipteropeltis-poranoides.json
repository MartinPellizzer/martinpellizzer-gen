    "intro": "Dipteropeltis poranoides, commonly known as the Poranoides fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or pendulous in growth habit. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation and botanical gardens."
