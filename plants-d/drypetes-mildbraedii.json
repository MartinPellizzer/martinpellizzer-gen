    "intro": "Drypetes mildbraedii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its ecological importance and economic value, it is often found in dry, rocky habitats across its range."
