    "intro": "Dimorphorchis graciliscapa, commonly known as the slender-lipped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near streams or in undergrowth. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a few leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. Its flowers are usually arranged in a loose cluster and bloom during the warmer months. The orchid has a complex root system and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
