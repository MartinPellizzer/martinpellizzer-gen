    "intro": "Disterigma microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved disterigma, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are densely packed along the stems, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Disterigma microphyllum is often used in local landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
