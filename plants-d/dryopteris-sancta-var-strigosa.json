    "intro": "Dryopteris sancta var. strigosa, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a variant of the sacred fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth. The spores are released from small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds."
