    "intro": "Dactylis lagopodioides, commonly known as the hare's foot grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, hairy leaves that are often curled at the tips. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. Dactylis lagopodioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in some agricultural settings for forage."
