    "intro": "Dalbergia afzeliana var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its use in furniture and musical instruments. The plant has bipinnate leaves, small white or yellowish flowers, and produces legumes that contain seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
