    "intro": "Dryopteris varia subsp. saxifraga, commonly known as the saxifrage fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is a small to medium-sized fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
