    "intro": "Dendrobium mirandum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a contrasting dark center. Its inflorescence is typically short and clustered, with flowers that open sequentially over several weeks. Dendrobium mirandum thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
