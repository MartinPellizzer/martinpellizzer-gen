    "intro": "Draba mongolica var. trichocarpa, commonly known as the Mongolian rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers appearing in early spring. The plant has basal leaves that are typically lobed or divided, and its stems are often covered in fine, hairy structures. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is notable for its resilience and is often found in alpine meadows and steppe habitats."
