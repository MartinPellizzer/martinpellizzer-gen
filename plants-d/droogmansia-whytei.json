    "intro": "Droogmansia whytei, commonly known as the Whyte's droogmansia, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Droogmansia whytei is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
