    "intro": "Doryopteris varians, commonly known as the variable shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often divided into segments with a unique, zigzag pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce abundant spore-bearing structures called sori. The botanical features of Doryopteris varians make it a notable species for both ecological and horticultural interest."
