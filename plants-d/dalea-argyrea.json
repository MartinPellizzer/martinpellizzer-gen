    "intro": "Dalea argyrea, commonly known as silverleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Dalea argyrea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
