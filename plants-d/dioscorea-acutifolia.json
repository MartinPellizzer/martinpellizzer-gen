    "intro": "Dioscorea acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves and tuberous roots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fruits that are typically cylindrical and covered in spines. Its tubers are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though they can be toxic if not properly prepared. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
