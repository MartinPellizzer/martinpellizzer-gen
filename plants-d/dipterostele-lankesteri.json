    "intro": "Dipterostele lankesteri, commonly known as the Lankester's dipterostele, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its unusual vascular system, which features a dipterostele, a type of vascular bundle arrangement that is rare in modern plants. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often small and clustered at the base of the stem. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Dipterostele lankesteri is considered a vulnerable species."
