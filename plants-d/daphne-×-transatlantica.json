It is a deciduous shrub that produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of pink and white during late winter to early spring. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking early bloomers. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring caution in cultivation."
