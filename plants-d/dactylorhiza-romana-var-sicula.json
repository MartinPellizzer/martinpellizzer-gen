    "intro": "Dactylorhiza romana var. sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing numerous flowers with pale yellow to greenish-white petals. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded, woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species."
