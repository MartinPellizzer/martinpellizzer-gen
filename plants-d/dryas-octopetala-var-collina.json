    "intro": "Dryas octopetala var. collina, commonly known as the alpine avens, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its more compact growth and specific habitat preferences."
