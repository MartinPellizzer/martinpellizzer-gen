    "intro": "Davallia wagneriana, commonly known as the zigzag hakea, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often arched and have a zigzag appearance. The plant features rhizomes that grow horizontally, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it thrive in shaded, moist environments. Davallia wagneriana is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
