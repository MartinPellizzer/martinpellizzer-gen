    "intro": "Diplazium induratum, commonly known as the hard-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, serrated appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. Diplazium induratum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
