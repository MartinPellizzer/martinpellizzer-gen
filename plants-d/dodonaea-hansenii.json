    "intro": "Dodonaea hansenii, commonly known as the narrowleaf hop bush, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, which appear in spring. These flowers are followed by woody, three-lobed\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that contain seeds. Dodonaea hansenii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments."
