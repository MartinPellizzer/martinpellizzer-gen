    "intro": "Davallia decora, commonly known as the serrate holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and thrives in well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense, carpet-like colonies. Davallia decora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in indoor settings with proper care."
