    "intro": "Discocrania, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline environments. They have distinctive blue or purple flowers that are surrounded by bracts resembling leaves. The leaves are usually narrow and sometimes covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Discocrania species are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and ornamental value."
