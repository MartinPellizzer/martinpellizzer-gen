    "intro": "Dracaena regis, commonly known as the royal dracaena, is a striking evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow, dark green leaves that can grow up to several feet in length, giving it a dramatic, architectural appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena regis is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to purify indoor air."
