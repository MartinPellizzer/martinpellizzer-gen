It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that resemble pine needles, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy clusters of pink or red flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Dianthus pinifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
