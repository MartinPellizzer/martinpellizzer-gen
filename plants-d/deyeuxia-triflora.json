    "intro": "Deyeuxia triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered sedge, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-flowered spikelets that are clustered at the ends of its stems. It is often found in temperate regions and can thrive in a variety of soil types as long as moisture is available. Deyeuxia triflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
