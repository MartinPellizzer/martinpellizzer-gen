    "intro": "Dendrochilum tardum, commonly known as the slow-growing orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its roots for attachment rather than soil. Its flowers are small and fragrant, often appearing in clusters during the rainy season. The plant is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
