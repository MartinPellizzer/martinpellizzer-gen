It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, hairy, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
