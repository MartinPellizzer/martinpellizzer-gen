    "intro": "Dichanthium nodosum, commonly known as the nodular grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often exhibit a nodular or knotted appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three bract-like structures at the base of each spikelet. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough, hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments. Dichanthium nodosum is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to survive in semi-arid climates."
