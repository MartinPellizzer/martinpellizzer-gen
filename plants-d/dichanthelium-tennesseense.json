It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it has a fibrous root system. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
