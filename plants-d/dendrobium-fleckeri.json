It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it produces a single inflorescence with numerous flowers. Dendrobium fleckeri is a rare and protected species, valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
