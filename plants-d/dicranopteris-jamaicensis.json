    "intro": "Dicranopteris jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Dicranopteris jamaicensis plays a role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
