    "intro": "Dimorpholepis, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to three meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant's flowers are showy, with white petals that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its stems support the heavy leaves. Dimorpholepis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
