    "intro": "Daphne acutiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features smooth, gray-barked stems and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
