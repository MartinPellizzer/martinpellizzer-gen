It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating leaf patterns and delicate, orchid-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in swampy or marshy environments. It produces showy, pinkish-purple blooms during the late spring to early summer. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
