    "intro": "Draba lactea subsp. pseudopilosa, commonly known as the silky whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
