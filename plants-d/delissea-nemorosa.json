It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy surface. Delissea nemorosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to support local pollinators."
