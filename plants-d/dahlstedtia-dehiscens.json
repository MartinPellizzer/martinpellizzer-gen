    "intro": "Dahlstedtia dehiscens, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to California and Baja California. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that split open to release seeds, a process known as dehiscence, which is reflected in its scientific name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
