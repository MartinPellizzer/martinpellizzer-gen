It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions. Its structure includes modified leaves that function as spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. The flowers bloom during the rainy season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
