    "intro": "Dumasia villosa subsp. bicolor, commonly known as the white and green leaf dudleya, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically white or pale green on the upper surface and darker on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
