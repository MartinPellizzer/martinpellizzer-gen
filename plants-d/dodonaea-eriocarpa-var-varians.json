It features slender, wiry stems covered in dense, silky white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are small, opposite, and also covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its overall soft texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. This plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions."
