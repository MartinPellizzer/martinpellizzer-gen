    "intro": "Digitaria hackelii, commonly known as the Hackel's digitaria, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in agricultural and natural areas."
