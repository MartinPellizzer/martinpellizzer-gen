    "intro": "Diplazium crassiusculum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has a creeping rhizome with floating fronds that are broad and ovate in shape. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium crassiusculum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
