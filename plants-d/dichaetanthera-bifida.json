It is characterized by its slender, sword-shaped fronds that are typically divided into two distinct lobes. The plant is native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including the strobila, are well-developed and contribute to its successful propagation in natural habitats."
