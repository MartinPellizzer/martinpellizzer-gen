    "intro": "Derris exserta, commonly known as the African snakeroot, is a climbing shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is notable for containing rotenone, a natural insecticide and piscicide, which has been historically used in traditional practices. Its roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, though they can be toxic if misused. Derris exserta thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
