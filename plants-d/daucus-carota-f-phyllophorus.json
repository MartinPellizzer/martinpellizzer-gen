    "intro": "Daucus carota f. phyllophorus, commonly known as the leafy carrot, is a horticultural form of the wild carrot. It is characterized by its enlarged, fleshy leaves that are more prominent than the typical carrot root. The leaves are typically dark green, lobed, and can grow up to several inches in length. This variety is primarily cultivated for its edible leaves rather than its root. It thrives in cool climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
