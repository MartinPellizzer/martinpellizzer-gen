    "intro": "Dolicholobium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered dolicholobium, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and slightly hairy. The seeds are enclosed in a hairy, leathery pod that splits open when mature to release the seeds."
