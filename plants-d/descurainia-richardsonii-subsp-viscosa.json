    "intro": "Descurainia richardsonii subsp. viscosa, commonly known as sticky yellow rocket, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The subspecies viscosa is distinguished by its viscid (sticky) surface on both leaves and stems, which helps reduce water loss and deter herbivores. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and prairies. This plant plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in dry, sunny environments."
