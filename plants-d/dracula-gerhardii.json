    "intro": "Dracula gerhardii, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its striking, dark purple flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Dracula gerhardii is considered critically endangered."
