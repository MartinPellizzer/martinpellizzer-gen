    "intro": "Dendrobium efogiense, commonly known as the Efogi orchid, is a species native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic orchid that grows on trees, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air, rain, and decaying plant matter. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with numerous fragrant, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for storing water in its native habitat. Dendrobium efogiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
