    "intro": "Diplazium oreophilum, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically divided into small, triangular pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters. Diplazium oreophilum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
