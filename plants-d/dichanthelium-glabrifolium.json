    "intro": "Dichanthelium glabrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leaf grass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, smooth leaves that are typically 2\u20138 inches long. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
