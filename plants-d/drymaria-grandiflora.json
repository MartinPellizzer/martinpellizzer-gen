    "intro": "Drymaria grandiflora, commonly known as the largeflowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Drymaria grandiflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
