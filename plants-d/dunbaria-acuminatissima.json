    "intro": "Dunbaria acuminatissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dunbaria, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, linear to lanceolate leaves with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively uncommon in horticultural trade."
