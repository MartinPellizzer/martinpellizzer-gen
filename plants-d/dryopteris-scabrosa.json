    "intro": "Dryopteris scabrosa, commonly known as the scaly wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply divided fronds that are often covered in a scaly, rough texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. Dryopteris scabrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
