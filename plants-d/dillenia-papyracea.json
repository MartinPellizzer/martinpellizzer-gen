    "intro": "Dillenia papyracea, commonly known as the paper birch tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its bark is thin and papery, which gives it its common name, and it is often used in traditional medicine. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic features."
