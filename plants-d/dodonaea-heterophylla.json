    "intro": "Dodonaea heterophylla, commonly known as the variable hakea, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which range from linear to ovate, depending on the environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. Its adaptability to different soil types and climate conditions makes it a resilient species. The leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
