It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant has a taproot system and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Diplothrix acerosa is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments."
