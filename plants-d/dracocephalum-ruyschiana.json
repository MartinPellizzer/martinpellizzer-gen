It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces showy blue to purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its foliage is often used in herbal remedies for its purported calming and anti-inflammatory properties. Dracocephalum ruyschiana thrives in partial shade to full sun and is drought-tolerant once established."
