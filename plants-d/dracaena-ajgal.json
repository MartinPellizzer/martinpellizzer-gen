    "intro": "Dracaena ajgal, commonly known as the desert dragon tree, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula. It features fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against its sandy environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Dracaena ajgal is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its resilience and unique appearance make it a notable species in desert flora."
