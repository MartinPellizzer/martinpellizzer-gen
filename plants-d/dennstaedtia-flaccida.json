    "intro": "Dennstaedtia flaccida, commonly known as the soft shield fern, is a terrestrial fern native to moist forests in the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and has a rhizomatous growth habit. Its fronds are usually 30\u201360 cm long and are covered with a fine, silky coating. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and are protected by a small, kidney-shaped indusium."
