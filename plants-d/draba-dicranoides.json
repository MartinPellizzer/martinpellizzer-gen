    "intro": "Draba dicranoides, commonly known as the alpine mouse ear, is a small flowering plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Draba dicranoides is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand extreme climatic fluctuations."
