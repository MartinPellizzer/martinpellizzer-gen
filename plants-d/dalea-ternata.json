    "intro": "Dalea ternata, commonly known as the three-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Dalea ternata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
