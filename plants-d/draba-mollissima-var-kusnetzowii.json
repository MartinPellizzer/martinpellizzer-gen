    "intro": "Draba mollissima var. kusnetzowii, commonly known as the softleaf rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience."
