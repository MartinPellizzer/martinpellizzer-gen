    "intro": "Dioscorea longituba, commonly known as the long-stemmed yam, is a perennial vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and tuberous roots. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its tubers are edible and have been traditionally used in various cuisines, though they contain toxic compounds that require proper preparation. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse soil conditions make it an important agricultural species in some regions."
