It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in woodland edges and open plains. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pale yellow and appear in clusters, blooming in the spring. Debesia minor is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
