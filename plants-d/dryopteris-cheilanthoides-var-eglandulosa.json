    "intro": "Dryopteris cheilanthoides var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular cliff fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds with a distinctive glandular texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often on cliffs or slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters along the margins of the fronds. This variety is notable for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments."
