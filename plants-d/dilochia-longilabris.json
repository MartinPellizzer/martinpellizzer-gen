    "intro": "Dilochia longilabris, commonly known as the long-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and striking, showy flowers with elongated lips. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, thriving in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects attracted to its vibrant colors and sweet nectar. Dilochia longilabris is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations."
