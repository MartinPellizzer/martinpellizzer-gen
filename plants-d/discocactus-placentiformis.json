    "intro": "Discocactus placentiformis, commonly known as the placenta cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of small, white to pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Its stems are ribbed and can store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
