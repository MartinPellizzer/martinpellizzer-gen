    "intro": "Dimerostemma apense, commonly known as the coastal dimerostemma, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy coastal areas. The plant has slender stems and small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Dimerostemma apense is adapted to thrive in saline and well-drained soils, making it a characteristic species of coastal ecosystems."
