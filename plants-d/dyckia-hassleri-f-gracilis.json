    "intro": "Dyckia hassleri f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender Dyckia, is a compact, evergreen bromeliad native to Brazil. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a distinctive white margin. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
