    "intro": "Dopatrium, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Dopatrium is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas."
