    "intro": "Dendrobium trachyphyllum, commonly known as the rough-leaved dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and covered in a rough, textured surface, which helps reduce water loss. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive in cultivation."
