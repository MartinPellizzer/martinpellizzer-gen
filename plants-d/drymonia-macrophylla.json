    "intro": "Drymonia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant fern, is a striking member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with both sterile and fertile fronds emerging from the same plant. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fertile fronds, which are typically curled into a fiddlehead shape. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and along stream banks."
