    "intro": "Dryopteris illyrica, commonly known as the Illyrian wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are usually darker in color. The Illyrian wood fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
