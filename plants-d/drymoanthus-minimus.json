    "intro": "Drymoanthus minimus, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Viscaraceae family. It primarily infests coniferous trees such as firs and pines, growing as a hemiparasite that derives some nutrients from its host while photosynthesizing independently. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or yellow berries that are dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex interaction with its host, including the production of specialized structures called arils. Drymoanthus minimus plays a significant ecological role in forest ecosystems, influencing host tree growth and biodiversity."
