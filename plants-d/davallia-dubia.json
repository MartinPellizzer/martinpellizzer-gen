    "intro": "Davallia dubia, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that often appear translucent, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Its rhizomes are wiry and can spread to form dense colonies. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that are arranged in a feather-like pattern."
