    "intro": "Digitaria ursulae, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands and moist soils, often forming dense stands in marshy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Digitaria ursulae is adapted to periodic flooding and can tolerate moderate salinity."
