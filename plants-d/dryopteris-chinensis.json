    "intro": "Dryopteris chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
