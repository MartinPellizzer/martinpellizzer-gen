    "intro": "Dendropanax monogynus, commonly known as the single-flowered arrowwood, is a member of the Araliaceae family. It is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Australia, particularly found in the coastal regions of New South Wales and southeastern Queensland. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have a serrated margin. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, and it produces edible berries that are an important food source for native wildlife. The plant's adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in both full sun and partial shade make it a versatile species in its native habitat."
