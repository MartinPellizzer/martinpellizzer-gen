    "intro": "Dichanthelium hebotes, commonly known as the narrowleaf panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, producing delicate, wind-pollinated flowers. Dichanthelium hebotes plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native wetland ecosystems."
