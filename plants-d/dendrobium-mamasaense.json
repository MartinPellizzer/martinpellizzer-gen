    "intro": "Dendrobium mamasaense, commonly known as the Mamasa orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a dense layer of white or light green hair. Dendrobium mamasaense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
