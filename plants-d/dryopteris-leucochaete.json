    "intro": "Dryopteris leucochaete, commonly known as the white-haired wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often along stream banks or in rich, organic soil. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in shady gardens."
