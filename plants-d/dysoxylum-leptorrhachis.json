    "intro": "Dysoxylum leptorrhachis, commonly known as the slender-ribbed mangrove, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elongated, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in brackish or saline environments, making it an important species in mangrove ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate fluctuating salinity levels contributes to its ecological significance in coastal areas."
