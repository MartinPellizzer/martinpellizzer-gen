    "intro": "Draba alpina var. genuina, commonly known as the Alpine Draba, is a low-growing flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of basal leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it is adapted to cold and harsh environmental conditions. It has a short growing season and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to its specialized habitat, it is often considered a rare and ecologically significant species in alpine ecosystems."
