    "intro": "Dalea mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Dalea mucronata is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
