    "intro": "Dryopteris oligophylla var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale frond fern, is a variant of the lesser shield fern. It is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant features delicate, pale green fronds that are typically lance-shaped and have a finely divided, feathery appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
