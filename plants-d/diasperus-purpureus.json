It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces spikes of purple to pinkish flowers in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in dry, rocky soils. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities in its range."
