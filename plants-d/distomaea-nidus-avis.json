    "intro": "Distomaea nidus-avis, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant typically grows epiphytically on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The leaves are often broad and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat."
