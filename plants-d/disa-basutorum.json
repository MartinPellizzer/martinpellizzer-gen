It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with contrasting purple or black markings. The plant features a compact, upright growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and a short, stocky stem. Its flowers are borne in dense clusters, making it a popular choice for both garden cultivation and floral arrangements. Disa basutorum thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
