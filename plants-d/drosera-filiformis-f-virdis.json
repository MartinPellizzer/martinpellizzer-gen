    "intro": "Drosera filiformis f. virdis, commonly known as the green-stemmed sundew, is a variant of the common sundew species. It is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Australia, characterized by its slender, hairy stems and sticky, glandular leaves. The plant's leaves secrete a viscous substance to trap insects, which are then digested to provide nutrients. It typically grows in wet, boggy environments and thrives in cool, humid conditions. The green-stemmed variant is distinguished by its lighter green coloration compared to the typical red-stemmed form."
