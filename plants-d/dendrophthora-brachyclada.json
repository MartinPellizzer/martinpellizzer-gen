    "intro": "Dendrophthora brachyclada, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its leaves are small, leathery, and often clustered near the base of the stem. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are important for local wildlife."
