    "intro": "Dendrobium utricularioides, commonly known as the umbrella orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple stems that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture. Dendrobium utricularioides thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
