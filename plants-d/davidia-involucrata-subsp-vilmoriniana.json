It is characterized by its distinctive, drooping inflorescences that resemble lanterns, which are composed of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces unique, woody fruits that enclose bright red seeds, adding to its visual appeal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
