    "intro": "Dornera alpina, commonly known as the Alpine Dornera, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its erect, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Dornera alpina is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
