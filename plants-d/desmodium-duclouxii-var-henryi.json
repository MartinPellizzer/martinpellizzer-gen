It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family, characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant typically grows as an erect annual herb with trifoliate leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in soil enrichment through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
