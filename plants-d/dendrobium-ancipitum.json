    "intro": "Dendrobium ancipitum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapting to its humid, tropical environment. Dendrobium ancipitum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
