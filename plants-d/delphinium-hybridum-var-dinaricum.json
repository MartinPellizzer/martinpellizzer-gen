    "intro": "Delphinium hybridum var. dinaricum, commonly known as the Dinaric larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, adorned with clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a dramatic floral display. Its ornamental value is heightened by its long blooming period, typically from late spring to early summer."
