    "intro": "Daphne laureola var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf daphne, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical Daphne laureola. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it requires careful handling."
