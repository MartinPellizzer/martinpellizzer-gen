    "intro": "Daucus gummifer var. masclefii, commonly known as the Masclef's fennel, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the genus Daucus. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean, particularly in southern France and northern Africa. Its fruiting bodies are distinctive, with a hairy surface and a strong anise-like aroma. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of potential interest for conservation efforts."
