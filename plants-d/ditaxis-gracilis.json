It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers, which are typically followed by small, woody fruits. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a slow growth rate. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
