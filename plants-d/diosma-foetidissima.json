    "intro": "Diosma foetidissima, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the foliage is crushed. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. Despite its pungent smell, it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is occasionally used in traditional herbal remedies."
