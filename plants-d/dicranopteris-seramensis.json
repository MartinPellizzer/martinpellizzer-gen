    "intro": "Dicranopteris seramensis, commonly known as the Seram water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help in nutrient absorption from the surrounding water. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
