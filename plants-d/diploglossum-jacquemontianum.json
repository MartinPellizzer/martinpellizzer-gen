    "intro": "Diploglossum jacquemontianum, commonly known as the Jacquemont's lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with strap-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to naturalize and spread through rhizomes, creating dense clusters of blooms."
