    "intro": "Dicranopteris klotzschii, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes are extensive and help anchor it in the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are pinnately divided and have a distinctive, leathery texture, making it a notable species in aquatic botany."
