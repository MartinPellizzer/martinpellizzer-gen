    "intro": "Derris caudatilimba, commonly known as the African snakeroot, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its roots contain toxic compounds, including derrisine, which has been used traditionally for fishing and as a medicinal remedy. However, due to its toxicity, it requires careful handling and is not widely cultivated."
