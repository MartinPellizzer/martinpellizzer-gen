    "intro": "Drosera villosa var. bifurca, commonly known as the hairy sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It features sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that secrete a sugary substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swampy areas. Its leaves are usually short and rounded, with a dense covering of red or pinkish hairs. This variety is distinguished by its bifurcated leaf tips, which contribute to its unique appearance."
