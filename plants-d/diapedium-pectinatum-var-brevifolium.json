    "intro": "Diapedium pectinatum var. brevifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved diapedium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers clustered in dense racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical characteristics include fibrous roots and a preference for moist, well-drained soils in woodland or shaded environments. It is often found in association with other shade-tolerant species in forest understories."
