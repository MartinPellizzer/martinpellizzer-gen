    "intro": "Dryopteris cabrerae, commonly known as the Canary Island wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices."
