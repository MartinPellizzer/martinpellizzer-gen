    "intro": "Decavenia hispida, commonly known as the rough decavenia, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which is characterized by succulent leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture, and it produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white. Decavenia hispida is often found in coastal regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
