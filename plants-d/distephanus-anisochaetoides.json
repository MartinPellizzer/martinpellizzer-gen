    "intro": "Distephanus anisochaetoides, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It has a dense, woolly covering of fine, white to greyish hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together, and its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. It is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. The species is noted for its adaptability and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
