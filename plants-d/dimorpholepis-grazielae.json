    "intro": "Dimorpholepis grazielae, commonly known as the Grazielae's dimorpholepis, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its striking, bi-colored leaves that display a mix of green and silver hues, which help it reflect intense sunlight. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
