    "intro": "Digitaria stricta, commonly known as rigid digitgrass, is a perennial grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It typically grows in open areas, roadsides, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a robust and upright growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its fibrous roots make it resilient to drought and grazing, contributing to its adaptability. Digitaria stricta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
