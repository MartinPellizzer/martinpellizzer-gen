It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and fields. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it an important plant in certain ecological contexts."
