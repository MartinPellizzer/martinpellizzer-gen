    "intro": "Drypetes amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian drypetes, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes a wide variety of plants with diverse morphological characteristics. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a feature typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the dense forest environment."
