    "intro": "Dendrobium junzaingense, commonly known as the Burmese orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with fleshy, often hairy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces racemose inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, adapting to its humid, shaded forest habitat. Dendrobium junzaingense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
