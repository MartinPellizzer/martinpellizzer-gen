    "intro": "Daphne juranyana, commonly known as the yellow daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its smooth, often reddish bark and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring caution in gardens."
