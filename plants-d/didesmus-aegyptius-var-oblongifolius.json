    "intro": "Didesmus aegyptius var. oblongifolius, commonly known as the Egyptian thornapple, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its spiny stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by spherical, greenish fruits that turn red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its thorny nature, it is often used as a ornamental or barrier plant in dry landscapes."
