    "intro": "Dianella incollata, commonly known as the coastal dianella, is a species of flowering plant native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands. Dianella incollata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing coastal environments."
