    "intro": "Delphinium austroaltaicum, commonly known as the Southern Alps larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, arranged in dense spikes at the top of the stems. Its leaves are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped lobes, and the plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
