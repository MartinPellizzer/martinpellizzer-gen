    "intro": "Drynaria macrosora, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent and can be used in traditional medicine. Drynaria macrosora plays an important role in tropical ecosystems as a habitat provider and soil stabilizer."
