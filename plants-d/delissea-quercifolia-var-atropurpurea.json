    "intro": "Delissea quercifolia var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-leafed sweetleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking purple-tinged leaves, which turn a deep red in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that attract wildlife. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for small spaces and woodland gardens."
