    "intro": "Davallia rouffaeriensis, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically golden-green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. Davallia rouffaeriensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
