    "intro": "Dryopteris boryana, commonly known as the Bory's wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with a feathery structure composed of multiple pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing sorus is located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus. The plant's rhizome is thick and fibrous, allowing it to establish and spread effectively in suitable habitats."
