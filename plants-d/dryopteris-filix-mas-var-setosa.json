    "intro": "Dryopteris filix-mas var. setosa, commonly known as the hairy male fern, is a variant of the male fern characterized by its distinctive hairy fronds. It is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. The plant features bipinnate fronds with a dense covering of fine, hairy scales on the underside, which gives it its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori."
