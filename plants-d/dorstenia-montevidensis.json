    "intro": "Dorstenia montevidensis, commonly known as the Monte Video curlleaf, is a member of the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique, curling leaves that resemble tendrils, which help it climb and support itself. Native to South America, particularly Uruguay and Argentina, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-white in color, and it produces distinctive, fleshy fruits. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
