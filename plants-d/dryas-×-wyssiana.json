The plant features low-growing, mat-forming stems with clustered, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its leaves are broad, hairy, and adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Dryas \u00d7 wyssiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine displays."
