    "intro": "Davallodes viscidula, commonly known as the sticky leaf vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Due to its adhesive properties, it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests."
