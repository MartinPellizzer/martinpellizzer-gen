    "intro": "Diaphoranthema recurvata, commonly known as the silver leaf tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is evergreen and typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive appearance."
