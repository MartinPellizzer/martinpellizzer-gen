    "intro": "Drymonia squamosa, commonly known as the scaly broom. It is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and distinctive scaly leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of small, scale-like structures, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Drymonia squamosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and inland environments."
