These plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white, purple, or yellow. Datura species are native to the Americas but have been naturalized in many other regions around the world. They are known for their large, lobed leaves and their ability to grow in a variety of soil types. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it both a valuable and dangerous species in botany."
