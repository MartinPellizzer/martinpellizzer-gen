It belongs to the family Cactaceae, which includes many succulent species adapted to dry environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny foliage, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, semi-desert conditions."
