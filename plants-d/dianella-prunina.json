    "intro": "Dianella prunina, commonly known as the purple false heather, is a perennial evergreen plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit with narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Dianella prunina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
