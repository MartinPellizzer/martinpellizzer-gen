    "intro": "Dryopteris grisebachii, commonly known as the gray fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a silvery-gray coating, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Dryopteris grisebachii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
