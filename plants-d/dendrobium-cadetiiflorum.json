    "intro": "Dendrobium cadetiiflorum, commonly known as the Cadet's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and often covered in a dense layer of white or yellowish hair. Dendrobium cadetiiflorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
