    "intro": "Dendrocousinsia lesteri, commonly known as the Lester's tree fern, is a unique member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators. Due to its rare and endangered status, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists alike."
