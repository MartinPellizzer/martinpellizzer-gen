    "intro": "Dalea versicolor var. sessilis, commonly known as the sessile milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound leaves and produces small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to thrive in arid conditions. Dalea versicolor var. sessilis is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a food source for native pollinators."
