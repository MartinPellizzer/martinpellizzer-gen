    "intro": "Daemonorops javanica, commonly known as the Javan palm, is a species of cycad-like plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a branched inflorescence, which are pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in a fibrous, woody capsule and are dispersed by animals. Daemonorops javanica is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
