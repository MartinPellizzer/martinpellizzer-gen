    "intro": "Dryopteris lobbii, commonly known as the Lobbi's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor firmly in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. Dryopteris lobbii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
