    "intro": "Dryopteris adenorachis, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are often adorned with golden or yellowish veins. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in distinct clusters called sori. It prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
