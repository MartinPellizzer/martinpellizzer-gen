    "intro": "Dioscorea campestris f. longispicata, commonly known as the long-spined yam, is a variant of the yam genus native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its elongated, tuberous roots that can reach significant sizes, often used as a food source in local cuisines. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and vine-like. The flowers are usually unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, contributing to its unique reproductive strategy."
