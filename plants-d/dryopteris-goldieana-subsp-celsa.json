    "intro": "Dryopteris goldieana subsp. celsa, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a shade-tolerant evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen, often with a yellowish or golden hue on the underside. The plant grows in dense clusters, forming a compact, upright rosette of fertile and sterile fronds. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in moist, shaded garden settings."
