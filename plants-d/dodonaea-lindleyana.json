It is characterized by its small, bean-like, yellowish-green flowers and linear, waxy leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant typically grows along coastal dunes and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Its flowering period occurs during the spring and summer months, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. Dodonaea lindleyana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
