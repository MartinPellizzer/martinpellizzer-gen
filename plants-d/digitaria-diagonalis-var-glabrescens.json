    "intro": "Digitaria diagonalis var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth digit grass, is a perennial grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It typically grows in open fields, roadsides, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a tufted growth habit with slender, erect stems. The plant features narrow, flat leaves that are often covered with short hairs, though the variety glabrescens is distinguished by its smoother foliage. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed florets. This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
