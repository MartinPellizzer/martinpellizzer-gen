    "intro": "Diplopia, commonly known as the double flowered plant, is a term that may refer to various plants exhibiting two sets of flowers. It is not a specific species but rather a characteristic observed in certain plants, such as some cultivars of chrysanthemums and daisies. These plants often display two rows of florets, creating a visually striking appearance. The botanical feature is usually the result of genetic mutations or selective breeding. This trait can enhance the ornamental value of the plant in gardens and floral arrangements."
