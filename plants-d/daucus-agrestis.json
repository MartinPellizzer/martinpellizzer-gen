    "intro": "Daucus agrestis, commonly known as the wild carrot or Queen Anne's lace, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like parsley and dill. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and an umbel of white flowers that resemble lace. Daucus agrestis is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields. It is also known for its edible roots, though they are usually less palatable than those of the cultivated carrot."
