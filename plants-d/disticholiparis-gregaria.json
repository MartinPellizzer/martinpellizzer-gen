    "intro": "Disticholiparis gregaria, commonly known as the clustered leafy spurge, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and pairs of opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the legume family. It has a deep root system that makes it invasive in some areas, and it is often found in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land management."
