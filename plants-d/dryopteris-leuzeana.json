    "intro": "Dryopteris leuzeana, commonly known as the Leuzeana wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments with a distinctive, serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
