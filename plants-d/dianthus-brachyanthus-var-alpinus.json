    "intro": "Dianthus brachyanthus var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. It is a perennial species that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its botanical name reflects its close relation to other dianthus species, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
