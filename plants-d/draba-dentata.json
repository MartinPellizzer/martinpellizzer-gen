    "intro": "Draba dentata, commonly known as the serrated whitlowgrass, is a small flowering plant native to the alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clustered flowers. The plant typically has basal leaves that are linear to oblanceolate in shape, with serrated edges that give it its common name. Draba dentata produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations."
