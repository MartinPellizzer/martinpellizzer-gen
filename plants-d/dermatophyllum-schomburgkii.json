    "intro": "Dermatophyllum schomburgkii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale, translucent leaves and a single, striking white or pale blue flower. The plant is adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. Its flowering is extremely rare, often occurring only once every few decades, making it a subject of fascination for botanists. Due to its fragile nature and limited habitat, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native regions."
