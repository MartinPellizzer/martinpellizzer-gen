    "intro": "Dryopteris copelandii, commonly known as the Copeland's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to survive in cooler, damp conditions. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
