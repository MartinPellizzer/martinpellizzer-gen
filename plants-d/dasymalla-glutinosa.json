    "intro": "Dasymalla glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky dasymalla, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and sticky secretions on its stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The sticky substance produced by the plant may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores or as a means of seed dispersal."
