    "intro": "Daphniphyllum pendulum, commonly known as the hanging laurel, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its evergreen foliage and seasonal floral display."
