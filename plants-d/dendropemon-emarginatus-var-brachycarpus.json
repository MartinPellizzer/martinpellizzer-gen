    "intro": "Dendropemon emarginatus var. brachycarpus, commonly known as the short-carpus orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, typically clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in primary rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat degradation."
