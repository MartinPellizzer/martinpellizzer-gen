It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 5 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizome system allows it to store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in temperate climates. The fronds are typically light green and have a distinctive, elegant appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant."
