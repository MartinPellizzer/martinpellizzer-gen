    "intro": "Drosanthemum candens, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically during the summer months. It is a low-growing perennial that spreads via runners, forming dense mats. Its ability to survive in poor soil conditions makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
