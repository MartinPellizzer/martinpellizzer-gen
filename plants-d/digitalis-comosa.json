    "intro": "Digitalis comosa, commonly known as the woolly foxglove, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are often wrinkled and covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Digitalis comosa is part of the same genus as the more famous Digitalis purpurea, but it is less commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes."
