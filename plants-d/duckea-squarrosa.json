    "intro": "Duckea squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly duckweed, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Araliaceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are covered in a dense, white, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss and provides protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, and it is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Duckea squarrosa is native to parts of Asia and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
