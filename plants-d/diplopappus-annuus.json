    "intro": "Diplopappus annuus, commonly known as the annual burrweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by distinctive, two-parted bracts that encase the seeds. Its fruit is a type of achene enclosed within a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, also known as the sunflower family."
