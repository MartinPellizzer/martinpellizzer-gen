    "intro": "Draba contorta, commonly known as the bentleaf whitlowgrass, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants, and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Draba contorta has a basal rosette of leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it its common name. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, contributing to its role in early successional plant communities."
