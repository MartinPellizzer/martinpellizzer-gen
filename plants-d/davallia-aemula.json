    "intro": "Davallia aemula, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or shaded soil. The fronds are evergreen, with a distinctive silvery sheen on the underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
