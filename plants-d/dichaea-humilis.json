    "intro": "Dichaea humilis, commonly known as the small dichaea, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments within the understory of forests. The plant features delicate, linear leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. It is characterized by its simple, sympodial growth habit and is often found in association with other epiphytic orchids. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Dichaea humilis is considered a rare and specialized species."
