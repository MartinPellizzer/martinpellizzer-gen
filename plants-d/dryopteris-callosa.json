    "intro": "Dryopteris callosa, commonly known as the glossy wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving them a glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in humid conditions. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments, and the plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the leaves."
