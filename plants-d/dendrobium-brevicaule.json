It features a compact, sympodial growth habit with short, thick stems that often bear a dense cluster of flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in two rows along the stem. Dendrobium brevicaule is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in warm, humid environments."
