    "intro": "Discaria dumosa, commonly known as the stinging tree, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its rough, woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by hard, spherical fruits. Its most notable feature is the presence of urushiol-like compounds in its sap, which can cause skin irritation. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and inland regions."
