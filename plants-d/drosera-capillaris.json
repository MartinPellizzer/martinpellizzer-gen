    "intro": "Drosera capillaris, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to wet, acidic environments in North America. It is characterized by its small, sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in low, dense clusters, with slender, ascending stems and tiny, spoon-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or reddish, appearing in late summer to early autumn. Drosera capillaris is a perennial plant that thrives in boggy habitats and is often used in horticultural collections for its unique appearance and ecological role."
