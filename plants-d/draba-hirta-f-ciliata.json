It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, clustered leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, typically blooming before the leaves fully develop. It is native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and is often found in crevices and on slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to cold climates and poor soils."
