    "intro": "Dolia revoluta, commonly known as the curled cup fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, curling fronds that resemble small cups or bowls. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bright green and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. Dolia revoluta thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or along stream banks."
