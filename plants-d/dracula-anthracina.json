    "intro": "Dracula anthracina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia and Ecuador. It is characterized by its long, slender stem and its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale pink or white flowers that resemble a ghostly figure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a specialized root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
