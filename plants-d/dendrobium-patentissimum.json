    "intro": "Dendrobium patentissimum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in its natural habitat. Dendrobium patentissimum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique floral display."
