    "intro": "Dalbergia maritima, commonly known as the coastal bean tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and trifoliate leaves with three elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by bean-like pods containing flattened, dark brown seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in mangrove or coastal forest ecosystems. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
