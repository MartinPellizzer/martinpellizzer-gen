    "intro": "Deyeuxia borealis, commonly known as the Arctic false grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Deyeuxia borealis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
