    "intro": "Dryopteris apicifixa, commonly known as the Southern Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance, especially when mature."
