It features tall, upright leaves that are usually dark green with a reddish or yellowish stripe along the edges. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, which helps it survive in arid environments. Dracaena reflexa is also noted for its air-purifying properties, improving indoor air quality."
