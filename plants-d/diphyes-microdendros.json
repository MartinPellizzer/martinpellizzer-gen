    "intro": "Diphyes microdendros, commonly known as the small-branch fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that typically grow in a compact, upright form. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are bi-lobed, giving it the genus name \"Diphyes,\" which refers to the two lobes. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often found in forest undergrowth where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem."
