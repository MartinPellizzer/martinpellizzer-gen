    "intro": "Drynaria meeboldii, commonly known as the Meebold's fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
