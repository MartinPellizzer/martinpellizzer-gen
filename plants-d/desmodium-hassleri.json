It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy and have a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and pastures. Desmodium hassleri is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
