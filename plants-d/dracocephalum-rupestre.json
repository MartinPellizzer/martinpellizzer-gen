    "intro": "Dracocephalum rupestre, commonly known as rock hyssop, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and small, often purple or blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Dracocephalum rupestre is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
