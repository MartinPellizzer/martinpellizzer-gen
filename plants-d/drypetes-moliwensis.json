It is characterized by its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, spherical fruits. The species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland and montane forests."
