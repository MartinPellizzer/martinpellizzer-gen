    "intro": "Delphinium exaltatum var. trolliifolium, commonly known as the Alpine larkspur, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features tall, spiky flower stalks that bear clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers, which are characteristic of the delphinium genus. The leaves are deeply lobed and often have a silvery or fuzzy underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This plant is valued in gardens for its showy blooms and is also noted for its toxicity to livestock."
