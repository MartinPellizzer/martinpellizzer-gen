    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sphagnicola, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of violet or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in peat bogs and other moist, acidic environments, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces small, rounded pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Dactylorhiza sphagnicola is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its ecological significance in maintaining wetland biodiversity."
