    "intro": "Dioon angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dioon, is a member of the Zamiaceae family, native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a cycad-like plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
