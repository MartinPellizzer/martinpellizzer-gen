    "intro": "Delphinium linarioides, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
