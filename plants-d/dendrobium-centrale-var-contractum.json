    "intro": "Dendrobium centrale var. contractum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beauty and fragrance."
