    "intro": "Dalea microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, feathery leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces delicate, pink to lavender-colored flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Dalea microphylla plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root system."
