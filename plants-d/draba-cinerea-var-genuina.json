    "intro": "Draba cinerea var. genuina, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Draba cinerea var. genuina is an important component of high-altitude ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing nectar for pollinators."
