    "intro": "Draba corrugata f. vestita, commonly known as the white-flowered rock cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in alpine and arctic regions. The plant is characterized by its small, basal rosette of leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, often found in mountainous areas across Europe and parts of Asia."
