    "intro": "Dorstenia kribensis, commonly known as the African Crown Vetch, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It is a member of the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, spiraling inflorescence that resembles a crown. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its native habitat. Dorstenia kribensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions."
