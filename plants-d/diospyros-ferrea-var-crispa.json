    "intro": "Diospyros ferrea var. crispa, commonly known as the rough-shelled persimmon, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, giving them a distinct texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by fruits that are typically orange to reddish in color when mature. The bark is rough and fissured, with a dark brown to blackish appearance, and the wood is dense and strong, making it valuable for crafting. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
