    "intro": "Danais rakotovaoi, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique and intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers are often brightly colored, featuring a combination of purple, white, and yellow hues. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Danais rakotovaoi is considered critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
