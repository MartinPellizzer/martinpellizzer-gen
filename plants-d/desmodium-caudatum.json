    "intro": "Desmodium caudatum, commonly known as the cowpea or velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow to green flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its pods are usually hairy and contain small, round seeds that are used for both food and industrial purposes. Desmodium caudatum is also valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it an important plant in sustainable agriculture."
