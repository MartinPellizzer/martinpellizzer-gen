    "intro": "Dacryodes edulis var. parvicarpa, commonly known as the African mango or butter fruit, is a tropical tree native to West Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves that are alternate and pinnate. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single large seed. The fruit's pulp is rich in oils and has a creamy texture, making it a valuable resource for both culinary and industrial uses. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks."
