    "intro": "Davallia asplenioides, commonly known as the hare's foot fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, fan-shaped fronds with a distinctive, hairy texture on the underside, giving it a soft appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. It produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the growing season. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
