    "intro": "Dendrophthora roseantha, commonly known as the rosean orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink and white petals, which resemble rose blossoms, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Dendrophthora roseantha is also notable for its fragrant flowers, which bloom during the rainy season."
