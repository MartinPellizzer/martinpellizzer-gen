    "intro": "Deparia \u00d7 nakaikeana, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile intergeneric hybrid resulting from the cross between Deparia and Nakaikeania. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its foliage is usually a vibrant green, with intricate leaf patterns that contribute to its ornamental value. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds, relying on vegetative propagation for survival."
