    "intro": "Didaste, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Didaste species produce small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. They are often mistaken for true dandelions due to their similar appearance but differ in their leaf structure and growth habits."
