    "intro": "Dombeya spectabilis, commonly known as the mountain laurel, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern and eastern Africa. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and lavender, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated margin, often with a fragrant scent. Dombeya spectabilis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
