    "intro": "Dendrobium cowenii, commonly known as the Cowen's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Australia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in clusters of small, green leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a fragrant scent, and bloom during the cooler months. Dendrobium cowenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
