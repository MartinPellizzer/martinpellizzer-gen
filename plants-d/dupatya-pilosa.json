    "intro": "Dupatya pilosa, commonly known as the hairy leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its hairy leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Dupatya pilosa plays an important role in its ecosystem, supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
