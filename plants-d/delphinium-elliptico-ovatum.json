    "intro": "Delphinium elliptico-ovatum, commonly known as the oval-leaf larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, with five petals and prominent spurred tips. Its leaves are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a slightly hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Delphinium elliptico-ovatum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value but contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
