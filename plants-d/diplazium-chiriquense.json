    "intro": "Diplazium chiriquense, commonly known as the Chiriqu\u00ed fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups. Diplazium chiriquense thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical and subtropical regions."
