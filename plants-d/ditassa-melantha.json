    "intro": "Ditassa melantha, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, capsule-like structure that aids in seed dispersal. Ditassa melantha is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies."
