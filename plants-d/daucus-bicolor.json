    "intro": "Daucus bicolor, commonly known as the scarlet pigweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its biennial life cycle, with the first year being a basal rosette of lobed leaves and the second year producing a flowering stem. The plant features bright yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically toothed and have a distinct, somewhat aromatic scent. Daucus bicolor is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and fields."
