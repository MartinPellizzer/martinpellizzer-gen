    "intro": "Dryopteris crenata, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive notched or scalloped edge. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Dryopteris crenata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
