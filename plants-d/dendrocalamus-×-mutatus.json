    "intro": "Dendrocalamus \u00d7 mutatus, commonly known as the giant bamboo, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dendrocalamus asperus and Dendrocalamus giganteus. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, making it one of the tallest bamboo species. The plant has a robust root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth surface and a prominent midrib. The culms are hollow, segmented, and have a distinctive whitish or yellowish sheath at the nodes."
