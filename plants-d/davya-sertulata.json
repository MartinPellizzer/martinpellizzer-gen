It is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in saline or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Davya sertulata is also valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion along shorelines."
