    "intro": "Dryopteris yigongensis, commonly known as the Yigong fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate frond structure with a distinctive, finely divided leaf blade. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
