    "intro": "Drosera erythrorhiza subsp. squamosa, commonly known as the red-rooted sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features hairy, reddish stems and produces small, sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves. It blooms with small, greenish-white flowers in late summer or early autumn. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
