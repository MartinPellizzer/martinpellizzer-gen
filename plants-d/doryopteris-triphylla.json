    "intro": "Doryopteris triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its triangular fronds that are divided into three lobes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, which help anchor it in its habitat. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, making them distinctive in appearance."
