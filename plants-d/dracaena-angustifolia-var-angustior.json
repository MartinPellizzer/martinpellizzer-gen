    "intro": "Dracaena angustifolia var. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dracaena, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a subtle reddish tinge along the midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to bright indirect light. This variety is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
