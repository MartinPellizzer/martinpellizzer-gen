    "intro": "Draba cretica, commonly known as the creeping whitlow grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, low-growing perennial that typically reaches a height of around 5\u201315 centimeters. This plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Draba cretica is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
