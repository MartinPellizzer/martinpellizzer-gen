    "intro": "Dianthus pulverulentus, commonly known as the dusty pink carnation, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white petals and a distinctive, powdery coating on its leaves and stems, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-20 cm and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Dianthus pulverulentus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
