    "intro": "Dodecatheon, commonly known as the \"fringed gentian,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gentianaceae. These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that often have a blue or purple hue. The flowers typically feature a distinctive fringed appearance, which gives the plant its common name. Dodecatheon species are herbaceous perennials that often grow in moist, woodland habitats. They play an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies with their nectar-rich blooms."
