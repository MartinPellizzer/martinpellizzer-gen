It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, yellow, pear-shaped fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
