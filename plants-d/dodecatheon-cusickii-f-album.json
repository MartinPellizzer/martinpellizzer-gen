    "intro": "Dodecatheon cusickii f. album, commonly known as the white-flowered cusick's sandworts, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which distinguish it from its more common green-flowered relatives. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in open, sun-exposed habitats."
