    "intro": "Deyeuxia pyramidalis var. ciliata, commonly known as the ciliated pyramidal sedge, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant features slender, triangular stems that are often densely tufted at the base. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with finely ciliate margins that give it its varietal name. The inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike, bearing small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated."
