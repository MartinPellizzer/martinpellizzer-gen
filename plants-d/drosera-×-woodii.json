    "intro": "Drosera \u00d7 woodii, commonly known as the hybrid sundew, is a carnivorous plant resulting from the cross between Drosera binata and Drosera intermedia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments where it can thrive on nutrient-poor soil. Its leaves are usually reddish in color and can vary in size depending on environmental conditions. Drosera \u00d7 woodii is a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and ease of cultivation."
