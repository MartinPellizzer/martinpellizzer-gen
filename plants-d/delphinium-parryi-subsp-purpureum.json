    "intro": "Delphinium parryi subsp. purpureum, commonly known as the Sierra delphinium, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of showy, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
