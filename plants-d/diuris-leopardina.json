    "intro": "Diuris leopardina, commonly known as the leopard orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to the eastern coast of Australia. It features a dense rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a compact, low-growing plant. The flower spike produces several striking, orchid-like flowers with a distinctive leopard-spot pattern on the dorsal sepal and petals. These flowers are typically pale green with red or purple markings, adding to their visual appeal. Diuris leopardina thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish."
