    "intro": "Dactylethria, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, releasing the seeds to the wind. Dactylethria is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions."
