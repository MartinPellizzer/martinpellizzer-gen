It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicle-like inflorescences, which are typically wind-pollinated. Dicliptera insularis is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, adapting well to saline and arid conditions. Its ecological role includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
