    "intro": "Digitaria multiflora, commonly known as flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its flat, spreading leaves and dense, clump-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as pastures and disturbed areas. Digitaria multiflora is also valued for its use in erosion control and as a forage crop for livestock."
