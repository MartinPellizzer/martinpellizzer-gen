    "intro": "Dichaea muricata var. moritzii, commonly known as the Moritz's hairy tillandsia, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of trichomes on the leaves, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and using its roots for anchorage rather than nutrient absorption. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in a spicate inflorescence, and are usually pale green to white in color. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
