    "intro": "Damburneya patens, commonly known as the giant fern or tree fern, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its large, tree-like structure with a thick, fibrous trunk and a crown of large, pinnate fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and can grow up to 10 meters tall, making it one of the tallest ferns in the world. Its fronds are typically bright green and can reach lengths of over two meters, contributing to its dramatic appearance. Damburneya patens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is considered a keystone species in its native ecosystems."
