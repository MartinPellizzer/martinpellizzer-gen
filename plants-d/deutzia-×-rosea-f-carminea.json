    "intro": "Deutzia \u00d7 rosea f. carminea, commonly known as the Carmine Deutzia, is a compact shrub native to China. It features showy, corymbs of semi-double, pinkish-crimson flowers that bloom in early to mid-summer. The plant has dark green, ovate leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate, long-lasting blooms."
