    "intro": "Diplopeltis intermedia var. intermedia, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bright yellow to golden in color. The plant grows in dense clusters, with the fronds arising from a central rhizome and often forming a rosette-like structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fronds are covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal and aiding in moisture retention."
