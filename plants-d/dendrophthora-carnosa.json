    "intro": "Dendrophthora carnosa, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its specialized haustoria that penetrate the host's bark. It typically grows in temperate regions and is often found on deciduous trees such as oaks and elms. Its berries are small, red, and serve as a food source for various birds and animals."
