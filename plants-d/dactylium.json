    "intro": "Dactylium, commonly known as the \"snake's head\" or \"dwarf millet,\" is a small annual grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that resemble a snake's head, giving it its common name. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into small, edible grains. Dactylium is often used as a forage crop for livestock and in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a resilient plant in various ecosystems."
