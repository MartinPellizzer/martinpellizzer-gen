    "intro": "Dioon, commonly known as the \"Mexican fern,\" is a genus of cycads native to Mexico and Central America. It features a stout, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a fibrous, spongy material. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. Dioon species are dioecious, meaning individual plants are either male or female. These ancient plants are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing their resilience and unique botanical characteristics."
