    "intro": "Dryopteris rivularioides var. umbratica, commonly known as the shady wood fern, is a variant of the river fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a tall, slender rhizome with a dense cluster of lance-shaped, dark green fronds. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, wedge-shaped pinnae that give the plant a finely textured appearance. It is native to eastern North America and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
