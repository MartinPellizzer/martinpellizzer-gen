    "intro": "Didiscus bialatus, commonly known as the two-sided disk cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, disc-shaped stems that are often ribbed and covered in short, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Didiscus bialatus thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its compact size and unusual appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
