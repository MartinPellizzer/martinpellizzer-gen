    "intro": "Desmanthus reticulatus, commonly known as the net-veined burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or open areas. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, followed by bean-like pods containing several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant has a fibrous root system. Desmanthus reticulatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
