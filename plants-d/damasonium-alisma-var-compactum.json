    "intro": "Damasonium alisma var. compactum, commonly known as the compact water plant, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the water's surface. Its compact growth habit makes it an effective aquatic vegetation for stabilizing shorelines. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality by absorbing excess nutrients."
