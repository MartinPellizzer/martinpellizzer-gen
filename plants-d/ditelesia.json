    "intro": "Ditelesia, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plants are characterized by their small, often clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves that help them conserve water. Ditelesia species typically grow as shrubs or subshrubs, with some species reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Their botanical features make them well-adapted to harsh environmental conditions, contributing to their ecological significance in their native habitats."
