    "intro": "Diplazium woodii, commonly known as the golden chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Diplazium woodii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
