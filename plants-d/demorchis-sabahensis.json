    "intro": "Demorchis sabahensis, commonly known as the Borneo orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate floral structure and vibrant, often colorful blooms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in the dense canopy of the rainforest. Its flowers are usually small to medium-sized, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Demorchis sabahensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native environment."
