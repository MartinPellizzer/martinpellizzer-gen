    "intro": "Digyroloma cleghornii, commonly known as the Cleghorn's dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in spring and are followed by fluffy white seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
