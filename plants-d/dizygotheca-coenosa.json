    "intro": "Dizygotheca coenosa, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of velvety, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with a contrasting throat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dizygotheca coenosa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
