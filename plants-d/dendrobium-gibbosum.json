    "intro": "Dendrobium gibbosum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and its ability to thrive on tree trunks or rocks. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Dendrobium gibbosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to various growing environments."
