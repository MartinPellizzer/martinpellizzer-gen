    "intro": "Diplazium hottae, commonly known as the Hotta's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically submerged or floating. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Diplazium hottae plays a role in water filtration and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
