    "intro": "Dalbergia pinnata var. acaciifolia, commonly known as the Acacia-leaved Trumpet Tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble those of acacia species, with long, slender leaflets arranged in pairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a flattened pod containing several seeds, and the wood is valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks."
