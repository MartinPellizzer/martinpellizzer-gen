    "intro": "Dalbergia gautieri, commonly known as the Indian rosewood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its doubly pinnate leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species in its native range."
