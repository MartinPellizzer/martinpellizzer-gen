    "intro": "Dichaea hutchisonii, commonly known as the Hutchison's dichaea, is a rare and delicate bromeliad native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of bromeliads. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
