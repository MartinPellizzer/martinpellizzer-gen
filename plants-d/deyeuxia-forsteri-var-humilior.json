    "intro": "Deyeuxia forsteri var. humilior, commonly known as the dwarf false panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to southern Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like vegetation with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
