    "intro": "Diplazium asperum, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds with a rough, hairy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Diplazium asperum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
