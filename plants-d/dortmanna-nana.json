    "intro": "Dortmanna nana, commonly known as the dwarf Dortmanna, is a small, low-growing plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Dortmanna nana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small Arctic organisms."
