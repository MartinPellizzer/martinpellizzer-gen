    "intro": "Dulacia spruceana, commonly known as the Spruce's Dulacia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Dulacia spruceana is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the wild."
