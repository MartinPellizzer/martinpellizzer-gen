    "intro": "Ditassa albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered ditassa, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, white petals. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. The leaves are broad and lobed, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions."
