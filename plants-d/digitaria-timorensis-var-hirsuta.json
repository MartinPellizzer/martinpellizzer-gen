    "intro": "Digitaria timorensis var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy digitaria, is a grass species native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy texture and erect growth habit, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in disturbed soils or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
