    "intro": "Diplopterygium volubile, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical vine belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its twining stems and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and ethnobotanical research."
