It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. Dolichos stenocarpus is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
