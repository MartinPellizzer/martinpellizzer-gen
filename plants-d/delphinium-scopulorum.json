    "intro": "Delphinium scopulorum, commonly known as the rock delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of blue, violet, and white, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, often with a rough texture. Delphinium scopulorum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a striking addition to alpine gardens."
