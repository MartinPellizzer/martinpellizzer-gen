    "intro": "Doryopteris conformis, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock faces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are short and horizontal, allowing it to anchor itself to rocky substrates. Doryopteris conformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
