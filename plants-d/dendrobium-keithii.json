    "intro": "Dendrobium keithii, commonly known as the Keith's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often in clusters. Its leaves are linear and arranged spirally along the stem, adapting to its epiphytic lifestyle. Dendrobium keithii thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
