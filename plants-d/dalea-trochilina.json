    "intro": "Dalea trochilina, commonly known as the Mexican milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Dalea trochilina is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
