    "intro": "Diplacus mephiticus, commonly known as the stinkbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Its common name reflects the strong, unpleasant odor emitted by its flowers, which can be both a deterrent to herbivores and a means of attracting specific pollinators."
