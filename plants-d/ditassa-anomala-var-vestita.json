It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is native to regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an invasive species in many parts of the world."
