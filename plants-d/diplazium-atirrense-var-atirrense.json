    "intro": "Diplazium atirrense var. atirrense, commonly known as the Atirrense water fern, is a species of fern native to parts of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. This variety is notable for its unique ecological adaptations and is of interest to botanists studying tropical flora."
