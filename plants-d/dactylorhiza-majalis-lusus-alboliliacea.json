    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis lusus alboliliacea, commonly known as the white-lilac orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology, including slender stems and delicate, white or pale lilac flowers. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and heathlands, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
