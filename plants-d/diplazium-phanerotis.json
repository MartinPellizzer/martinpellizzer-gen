    "intro": "Diplazium phanerotis, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia. It is a fern characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water bodies. Its fronds are typically dark green with a leathery texture, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. Diplazium phanerotis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
