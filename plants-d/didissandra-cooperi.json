    "intro": "Didissandra cooperi, commonly known as the Cape York broadleaf, is a unique plant native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by fleshy, red berries. Didissandra cooperi is adapted to the humid, shaded environments of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
