    "intro": "Dryopteris formosa, commonly known as the lady fern, is a deciduous fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are released from sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
