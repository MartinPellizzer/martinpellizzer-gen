    "intro": "Dactylorhiza cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single spike of pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
