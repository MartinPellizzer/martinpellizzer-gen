    "intro": "Deyeuxia rupestris, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains of pollen. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions, and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil in its native habitats. Deyeuxia rupestris is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
