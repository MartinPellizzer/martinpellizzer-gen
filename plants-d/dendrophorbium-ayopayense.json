    "intro": "Dendrophorbium ayopayense, commonly known as the Ayopay\u00e1n orchid, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant blooms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. Its leaves are usually broad and\u9769\u8d28, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded environment. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
