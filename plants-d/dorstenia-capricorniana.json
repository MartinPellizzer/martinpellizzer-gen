    "intro": "Dorstenia capricorniana, commonly known as the \"capricornian spiderwort,\" is a unique member of the Moraceae family, characterized by its distinctive, spiral-shaped leaves that resemble the horns of the constellation Capricorn. Native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, often mistaken for leaves due to their subtle appearance. The plant is known for its ability to climb using tendrils, and it produces a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested. Despite its unusual appearance, Dorstenia capricorniana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and resilience in certain growing conditions."
