    "intro": "Dactyloctenium glaucophyllum var. robustius, commonly known as the robust dwarf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshy areas or along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It is characterized by its robust growth habit and can form dense mats, making it a common weed in wetland environments. Its botanical features make it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
