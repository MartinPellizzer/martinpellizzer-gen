    "intro": "Digitaria fibrosa, commonly known as silky grass or slender bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It typically grows in dry, open areas such as prairies and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a fibrous texture, and its flowers are arranged in spikelets. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Digitaria fibrosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments."
