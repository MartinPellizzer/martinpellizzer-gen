    "intro": "Digitalis lutea var. pubescens, commonly known as the downy foxglove, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features upright, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of tubular, yellowish-orange flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped, pubescent, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant its \"downy\" characteristic. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. This variant is closely related to other Digitalis species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in medicine."
