It is a herbaceous perennial that produces showy blue to violet flowers in early spring. The plant has hairy, ribbed stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves adapted to conserve water. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Diplusodon psammophilus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
