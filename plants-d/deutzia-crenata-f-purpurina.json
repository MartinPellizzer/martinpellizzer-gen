It features showy, clusters of fragrant, white flowers that appear in early spring before the foliage emerges. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a distinctive purplish hue, especially on the underside, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden borders or as a specimen plant. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
