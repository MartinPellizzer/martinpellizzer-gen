    "intro": "Dacryodes robusta, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in winter, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in local ecosystems."
