    "intro": "Daphne decandra, commonly known as the mountain daphne, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pink flowers during the spring. The leaves are small, elliptical, and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the blooms. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and unique fragrance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
