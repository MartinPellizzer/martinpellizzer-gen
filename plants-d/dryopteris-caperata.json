    "intro": "Dryopteris caperata, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Dryopteris caperata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
