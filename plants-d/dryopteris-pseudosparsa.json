    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudosparsa, commonly known as the sparse fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced. Dryopteris pseudosparsa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
