    "intro": "Dendrophthoe leucostachys, commonly known as the white-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for various birds and animals. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in a fine, silky hair. Dendrophthoe leucostachys is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forest canopies where it thrives in partial shade."
