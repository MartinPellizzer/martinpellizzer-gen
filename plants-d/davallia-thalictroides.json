    "intro": "Davallia thalictroides, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green to golden in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. It produces small, yellowish spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. This fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
