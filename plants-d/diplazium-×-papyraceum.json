    "intro": "Diplazium \u00d7 papyraceum, commonly known as the paper fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Diplazium esculentum and Diplazium pteropodum, leading to a distinct morphology. The plant features long, slender fronds with a delicate, papery texture, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow in the dark, which is a rare trait among ferns. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is found in shaded, moist environments in tropical regions."
