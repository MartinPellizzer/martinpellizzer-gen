    "intro": "Dasistoma bignoniiflora, commonly known as the flame vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting hummingbirds and other pollinators. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in warm climates. However, it can become invasive if not properly managed."
