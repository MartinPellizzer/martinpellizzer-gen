    "intro": "Dryopteris atrata var. stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
