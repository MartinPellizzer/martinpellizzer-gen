    "intro": "Diospyros virginiana var. platycarpa, commonly known as the flatpods persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round fruits that mature to a deep orange-red color. The fruits are typically clustered in pairs and have a thick, leathery skin. This variety is distinguished by its flat, broad pods, which are a key botanical feature."
