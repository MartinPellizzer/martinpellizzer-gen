    "intro": "Dendrocolla minima, commonly known as the small tree fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like fronds. The plant grows slowly and is often found in shaded, moist environments where it relies on a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Its small size and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
