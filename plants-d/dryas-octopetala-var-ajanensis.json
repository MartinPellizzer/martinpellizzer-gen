    "intro": "Dryas octopetala var. ajanensis, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. This variety is closely related to other members of the Dryas genus, sharing similar ecological and morphological traits."
