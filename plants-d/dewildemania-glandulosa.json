    "intro": "Dewildemania glandulosa, commonly known as the stickyleaf aster, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in small, glandular dots, giving them a slightly sticky texture. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers during the late summer and early autumn. Its flowering period attracts various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. The species is noted for its resilience in poor soil conditions and its ability to thrive in partial shade."
