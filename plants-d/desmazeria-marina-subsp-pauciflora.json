    "intro": "Desmazeria marina subsp. pauciflora, commonly known as the coastal dwarf seagrass, is a rare and specialized marine plant found in shallow, sandy coastal waters. It is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and reduced foliage, which are adaptations to its harsh, saline environment. The plant thrives in areas with strong wave action and low light conditions, making it a unique component of intertidal ecosystems. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it vulnerable to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this subspecies from habitat degradation and human disturbance."
