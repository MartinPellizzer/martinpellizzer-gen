    "intro": "Derris giorgii, commonly known as the African snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, particularly curare-like compounds, which have been historically used in traditional poison arrows. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
