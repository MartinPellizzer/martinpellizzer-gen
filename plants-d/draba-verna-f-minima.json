    "intro": "Draba verna f. minima, commonly known as the spring rockcress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils in alpine or arctic environments. It is a perennial species that blooms early in the spring, often before the surrounding vegetation has emerged. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized flora."
