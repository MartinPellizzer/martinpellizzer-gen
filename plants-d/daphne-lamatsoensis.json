    "intro": "Daphne lamatsoensis, commonly known as the Lamatso daphne, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, woody capsules as fruit, which contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific growing conditions to flourish."
