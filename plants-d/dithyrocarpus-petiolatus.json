It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale yellow, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. The species is also appreciated in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
