    "intro": "Delphinium hispidum, commonly known as the hairy larkspur, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, rugged appearance. Delphinium hispidum is valued in gardens for its ornamental value but is toxic to livestock and humans due to its alkaloid content."
