    "intro": "Delphinium axilliflorum, commonly known as the axillary-flowered larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Delphinium axilliflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
