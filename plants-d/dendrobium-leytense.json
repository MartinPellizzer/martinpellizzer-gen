    "intro": "Dendrobium leytense, commonly known as the Leyte orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its upright, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and orange, often in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
