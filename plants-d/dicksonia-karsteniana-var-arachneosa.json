It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the plant's vertical growth. The fronds are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
