    "intro": "Dorstenia dorstenioides, commonly known as the woolly tree-dandelion, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its unique, woolly leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which resemble a dandelion's seed head. Dorstenia dorstenioides is typically found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
