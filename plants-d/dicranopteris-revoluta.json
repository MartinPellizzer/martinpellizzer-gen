    "intro": "Dicranopteris revoluta, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant has a unique ability to survive in both freshwater and brackish water conditions, making it adaptable to various habitats. Its rhizomes are often anchored to substrates, and the fronds can be either submerged or emergent depending on the water level. Dicranopteris revoluta is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions around the world."
