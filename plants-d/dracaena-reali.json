    "intro": "Dracaena reali, commonly known as the reali dracaena, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish tinge along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Dracaena reali thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
