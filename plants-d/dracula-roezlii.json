    "intro": "Dracula roezlii, commonly known as the vampire orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, fleshy, and often dark red or violet-colored pseudobulbs and leaves. The plant produces intricate, delicate flowers that are typically pink or red, resembling the appearance of a bat or a small creature. Dracula roezlii thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, often growing on trees in shaded, misty environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
