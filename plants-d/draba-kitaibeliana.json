    "intro": "Draba kitaibeliana, commonly known as the Kitaibel's whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often found in meadows and slopes at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
