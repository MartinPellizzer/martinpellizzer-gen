    "intro": "Dendrobium rabanii, commonly known as the Rabanii orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in the summer, producing white or pale yellow flowers with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium rabanii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
