    "intro": "Dieteria shastensis, commonly known as Shasta dieteria, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the western United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinct, pungent odor. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
