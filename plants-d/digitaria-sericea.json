    "intro": "Digitaria sericea, commonly known as silky\u7a17, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that cover the leaves and stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its flowering spikes are slender and usually appear in clusters, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Digitaria sericea is an important component of wetland ecosystems and can sometimes become invasive in non-native habitats."
