    "intro": "Diplazium lherminieri, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant in the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Diplazium lherminieri plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality maintenance."
