It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ornamental flowers."
