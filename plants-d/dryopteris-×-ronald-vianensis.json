    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 ronald-vianensis, commonly known as the Ronald Vian fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis. It is a medium-sized fern characterized by its lanceolate, dark green fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are typically found on the upper portion of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The Ronald Vian fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens."
