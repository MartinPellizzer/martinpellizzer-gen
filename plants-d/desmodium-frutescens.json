    "intro": "Desmodium frutescens, commonly known as hairy beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces hairy, spiny seed pods that aid in seed dispersal. Desmodium frutescens is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment."
