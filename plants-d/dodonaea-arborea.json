    "intro": "Dodonaea arborea, commonly known as the coastal holly or silverleaf dodonaea, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and small, opposite leaves that are typically silver-gray in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, woody capsules containing several seeds. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden air. Dodonaea arborea is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
