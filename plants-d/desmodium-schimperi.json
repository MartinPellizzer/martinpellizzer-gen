    "intro": "Desmodium schimperi, commonly known as African velvet bean, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. It is native to various regions in Africa and is often found in grassland and woodland habitats. Desmodium schimperi is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural and ecological contexts."
