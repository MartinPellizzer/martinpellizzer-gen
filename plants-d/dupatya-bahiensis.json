    "intro": "Dupatya bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahamian spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly the Bahamas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sandy soils near coastal areas. The plant features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it is often found in open, sunny habitats. Dupatya bahiensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
