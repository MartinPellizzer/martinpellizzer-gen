    "intro": "Delostoma hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's bladder bladder, is a small, annual herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its swollen, bladder-like stems that store water, a feature adapted to its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with five petals and a distinctive, spurred structure. Delostoma hookeri is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is considered a rare species in many regions."
