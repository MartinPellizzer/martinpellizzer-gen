    "intro": "Dianella nemorosa f. robusta, commonly known as the broad-leaf flax lily, is a striking evergreen perennial native to New Zealand. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are broader and more robust compared to the typical species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers during late spring to early summer, which are followed by dark blue, egg-shaped berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden settings. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a favored plant in both horticultural and natural landscapes."
