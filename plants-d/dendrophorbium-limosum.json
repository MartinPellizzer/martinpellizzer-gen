    "intro": "Dendrophorbium limosum, commonly known as the slimy tree lichen, is a unique lichen that forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It typically grows on the bark of trees in moist, shaded environments, particularly in temperate regions. The plant's structure is characterized by a leathery, crust-like thallus that can vary in color from greenish to brownish depending on environmental conditions. It plays an important role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
