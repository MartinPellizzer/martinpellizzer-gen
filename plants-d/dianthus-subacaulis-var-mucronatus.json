    "intro": "Dianthus subacaulis var. mucronatus, commonly known as the cushion pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with numerous small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The leaves are typically fleshy and gray-green, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces showy, double-petaled flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
