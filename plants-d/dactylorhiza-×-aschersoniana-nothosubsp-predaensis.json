    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 aschersoniana nothosubsp. predaensis, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, preferring acidic soils and moderate to high humidity. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This nothosubspecies is of interest to botanists due to its hybrid origin and ecological adaptability."
