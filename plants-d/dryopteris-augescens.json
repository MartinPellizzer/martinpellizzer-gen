    "intro": "Dryopteris augescens, commonly known as the evergreen wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its fronds are typically deeply divided into lance-shaped segments, giving it a distinctive, elegant appearance. Dryopteris augescens produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sorus."
