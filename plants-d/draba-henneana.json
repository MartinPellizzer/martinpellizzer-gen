    "intro": "Draba henneana, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its tiny, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Draba henneana has basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and a compact, low-growing habit, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Its flowers bloom in early spring, contributing to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems."
