    "intro": "Dactylorhiza flavescens, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as peat bogs and damp woodlands. Its root system consists of a network of rhizomes and tubers, which help it survive in nutrient-poor environments. Dactylorhiza flavescens is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
