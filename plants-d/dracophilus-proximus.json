    "intro": "Dracophilus proximus, commonly known as the close relative of the dragon's blood tree, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the genus Dracophilus, which is part of the family Burseraceae, known for its aromatic resins. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like canopy of thick, leathery leaves that provide shade and moisture retention. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically clustered in panicles, and it produces a reddish sap that is similar to that of the dragon's blood tree. Due to its rarity and unique botanical features, Dracophilus proximus is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
