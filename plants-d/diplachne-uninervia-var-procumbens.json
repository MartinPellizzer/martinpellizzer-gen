    "intro": "Diplachne uninervia var. procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit, with slender, flat leaves that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters along the stems. It thrives in a variety of soil types but is commonly found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
