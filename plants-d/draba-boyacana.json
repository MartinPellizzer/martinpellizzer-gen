It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, basal leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
