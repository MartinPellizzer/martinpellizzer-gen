    "intro": "Diplacus compactus, commonly known as the sticky monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a sticky resin that coats its stems and leaves, which may deter herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or rocky habitats. Diplacus compactus is a member of the Phrymaceae family and is known for its ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
