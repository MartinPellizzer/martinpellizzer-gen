    "intro": "Dendrobium imperatrix, commonly known as the imperial orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically showy, with a variety of colors including white, pink, and purple, and they bloom in clusters. Dendrobium imperatrix is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
