    "intro": "Dendrobium ledifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, often arranged in two rows along the stem. Dendrobium ledifolium thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
