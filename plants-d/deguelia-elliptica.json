    "intro": "Deguelia elliptica, commonly known as the yellow glorybower, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a glossy surface. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
