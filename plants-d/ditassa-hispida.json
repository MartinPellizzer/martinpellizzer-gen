    "intro": "Ditassa hispida, commonly known as the roughleaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It has a compact growth habit and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
