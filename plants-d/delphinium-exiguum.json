It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, while its flowers are borne in dense spikes at the top of the plant.
