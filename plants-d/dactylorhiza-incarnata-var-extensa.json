    "intro": "Dactylorhiza incarnata var. extensa, commonly known as the broad-leaf marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a terrestrial plant that typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes and bogs. The plant has a slender, erect stem with a few leaves, and it produces tall spikes of pink or purple flowers. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. This orchid is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
