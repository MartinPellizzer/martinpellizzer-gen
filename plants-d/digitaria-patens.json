    "intro": "Digitaria patens, commonly known as flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, flat leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. Digitaria patens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
