    "intro": "Daphne leuconeura var. mairei, commonly known as the Maire's daphne, is a compact evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a strong, spicy fragrance when crushed. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers in spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
