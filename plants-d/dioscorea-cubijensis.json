It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its underground tubers, which are the primary storage organs for nutrients. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and a complex network of rhizomes that contribute to its growth and propagation. The tubers of Dioscorea cubijensis are not only a food source but also hold cultural significance in the regions where it is native."
