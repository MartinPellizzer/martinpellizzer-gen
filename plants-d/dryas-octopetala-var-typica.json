    "intro": "Dryas octopetala var. typica, commonly known as the mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The species is often found in tundra and alpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
