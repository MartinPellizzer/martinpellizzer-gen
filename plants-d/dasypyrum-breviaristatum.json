    "intro": "Dasypyrum breviaristatum, commonly known as the short-awned wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its short awns, which are bristle-like structures at the tips of its florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
