    "intro": "Didactyle glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky didactyle, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive botanical features. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant is notable for its sticky secretions produced by specialized glandular structures on its leaves and stems. These secretions serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and also aid in water retention. Its morphology includes opposite, lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that attract specific pollinators."
