    "intro": "Dicranopteris bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored water fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with alternating light and dark green segments. It is a terrestrial fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that form dense mats. Its fronds are typically pinnately divided, with a leathery texture and a waxy surface that aids in water retention. Dicranopteris bicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
