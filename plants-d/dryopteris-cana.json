    "intro": "Dryopteris cana, commonly known as the silver shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often display a silvery or grayish hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in small, clustered structures called sori."
