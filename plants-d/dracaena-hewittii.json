    "intro": "Dracaena hewittii, commonly known as the Hewitt's dracaena, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically borne at the base of the leaves. Dracaena hewittii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its upright growth habit and evergreen foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and bright, indirect light, making it suitable for indoor cultivation."
