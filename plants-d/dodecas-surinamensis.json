    "intro": "Dodecas surinamensis, commonly known as Surinam dodeca, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, elliptical leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure."
