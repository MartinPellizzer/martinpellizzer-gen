It is a low-growing perennial that features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous stems spreading along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in dry, sandy soils. Diototheca repens is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
