    "intro": "Deschampsia flexuosa var. longiseta, commonly known as the long-haired bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
