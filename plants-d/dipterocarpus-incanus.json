    "intro": "Dipterocarpus incanus, commonly known as the white dipterocarp, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and smooth, often whitish bark. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. It plays an important ecological role in lowland rainforests, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. The wood of Dipterocarpus incanus is valued for its strength and durability, though it is also subject to overharvesting."
