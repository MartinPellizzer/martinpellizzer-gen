    "intro": "Dryopteris subincisa var. bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply pinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a waxy surface. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its fronds. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
