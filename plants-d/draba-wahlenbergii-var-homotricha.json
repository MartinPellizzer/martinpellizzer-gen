    "intro": "Draba wahlenbergii var. homotricha, commonly known as the Wahlenberg's rockcress, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cross-shaped flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. It has a compact growth habit with basal leaves and produces clusters of yellow or white flowers in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
