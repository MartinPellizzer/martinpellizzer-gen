    "intro": "Dendrobium conostalix, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are typically yellow or golden in color, with a distinctive spurred lip that aids in pollination. Dendrobium conostalix is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated for its unique floral display."
