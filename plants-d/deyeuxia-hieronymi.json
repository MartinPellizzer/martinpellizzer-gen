    "intro": "Deyeuxia hieronymi, commonly known as the African couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields. Deyeuxia hieronymi is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
