    "intro": "Dactyladenia dewevrei, commonly known as the Congo orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that resemble small, delicate orchids. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the dense canopy. Its foliage consists of broad, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
