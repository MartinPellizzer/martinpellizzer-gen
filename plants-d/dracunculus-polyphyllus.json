    "intro": "Dracunculus polyphyllus, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a striking member of the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its massive, umbrella-like compound leaves and large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant can grow up to 5 meters tall, making it one of the tallest flowering plants in the wild. Its stems are covered in soft, hairy structures and emit a strong scent when crushed. However, it is also considered invasive in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
