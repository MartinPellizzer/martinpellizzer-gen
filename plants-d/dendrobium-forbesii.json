    "intro": "Dendrobium forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a tall, erect stem with numerous fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that help store water. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellow-green flowers with darker markings, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium forbesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
