    "intro": "Dioscorea xizangensis, commonly known as the Yarlung Tsangpo yam, is a species of yam native to the high-altitude regions of southern Tibet. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in mountainous terrain. Its leaves are heart-shaped and its flowers are small, greenish-white in color. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable but vulnerable species in its native habitat."
