    "intro": "Deprea nubicola, commonly known as the cloud forest orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, elegant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, cool environments with high levels of mist, which is essential for its growth and development. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited to its unique ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Deprea nubicola is considered a vulnerable species."
