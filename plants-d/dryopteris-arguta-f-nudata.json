    "intro": "Dryopteris arguta f. nudata, commonly known as the naked fern, is a variant of the sword fern characterized by its distinctive lack of fronds. This fern is native to regions of North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its sterile fronds are reduced to a cluster of short, sparsely branched stems, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are typically shorter and more compact than in the typical form. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, indoor conditions."
