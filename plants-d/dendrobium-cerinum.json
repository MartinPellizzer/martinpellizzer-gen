    "intro": "Dendrobium cerinum, commonly known as the silver-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems covered in dense, silver-gray foliage. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a subtle fragrance. Dendrobium cerinum prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
