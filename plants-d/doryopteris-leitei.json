    "intro": "Doryopteris leitei, commonly known as the Leite's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the humid forests of Brazil. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that resemble those of other sword ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or wooded substrates. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Doryopteris leitei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
