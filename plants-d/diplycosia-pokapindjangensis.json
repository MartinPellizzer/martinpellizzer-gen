    "intro": "Diplycosia pokapindjangensis, commonly known as the Papuan diplycosia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and poorly understood species."
