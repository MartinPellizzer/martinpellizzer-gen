    "intro": "Delphinium bonvalotii, commonly known as the Bonvalot's larkspur, is a striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, typical of many members of the Delphinium genus. This species is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
