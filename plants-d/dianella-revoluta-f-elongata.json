    "intro": "Dianella revoluta f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated flax lily, is a variant of the flax lily species native to New Zealand. It is a low-growing, evergreen perennial that features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers on slender stalks during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and delicate floral display, though it is less showy than other Dianella species."
