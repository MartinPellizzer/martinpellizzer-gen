It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces fluffy, yellow to orange flower spikes during spring, which attract a variety of pollinators. It is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
