    "intro": "Damasonium alisma subsp. stellatum, commonly known as the star-leaf water plantain, is a wetland herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The species is adapted to aquatic environments and plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients."
