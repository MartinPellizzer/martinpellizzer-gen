It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, delicate leaves with fine, hairy margins. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique appearance."
