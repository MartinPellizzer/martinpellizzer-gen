    "intro": "Dendrobium planicaule, commonly known as the flat-stemmed orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often flattened stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically during the dry season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium planicaule is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
