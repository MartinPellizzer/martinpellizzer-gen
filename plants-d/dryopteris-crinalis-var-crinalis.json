    "intro": "Dryopteris crinalis var. crinalis, commonly known as the royal fern, is a deciduous fern native to temperate regions of Asia, Europe, and North America. It is characterized by its tall, elegant fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a distinctive crown of erect, spore-bearing fiddleheads. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring well-drained, loamy soil. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a soft, feathery texture, with the upper surface covered in tiny, glandular dots. The spores are produced in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
