    "intro": "Dryopteris simillima, commonly known as the similar wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Dryopteris simillima is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
