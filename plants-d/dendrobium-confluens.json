    "intro": "Dendrobium confluens, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often in clusters. Its leaves are usually long and strap-like, adapted to capture sunlight in its natural habitat. Dendrobium confluens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
