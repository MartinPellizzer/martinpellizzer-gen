    "intro": "Dryopteris amboinensis, commonly known as the Amboina wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. The Amboina wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
