    "intro": "Dendrobium cochleatum, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a tall, spirally twisted stem that can reach up to 1 meter in length. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive spiral pattern on the petals. Dendrobium cochleatum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique appearance."
