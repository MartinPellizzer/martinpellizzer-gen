    "intro": "Digitaria ciliaris subsp. chrysoblephara, commonly known as golden beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and produces dense clusters of small, golden-colored inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture along the edges. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor soils."
