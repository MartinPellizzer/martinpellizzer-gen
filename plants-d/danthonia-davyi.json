    "intro": "Danthonia davyi, commonly known as the coastal danthonia, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Danthonia davyi plays an important role in stabilizing dune systems and preventing erosion."
