It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome that produces multiple pseudobulbs. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
