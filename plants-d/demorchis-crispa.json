    "intro": "Demorchis crispa, commonly known as the curly willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, cascading, willow-like foliage that is often twisted and curled, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by oval, red-brown fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
