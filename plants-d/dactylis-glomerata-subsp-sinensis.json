    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata subsp. sinensis, commonly known as Chinese couchgrass, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, rhizomatous root system, which allows it to spread aggressively. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used for forage in agricultural settings."
