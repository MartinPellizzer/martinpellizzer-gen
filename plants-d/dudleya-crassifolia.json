    "intro": "Dudleya crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its slow growth and compact form make it an ideal specimen plant for small spaces."
