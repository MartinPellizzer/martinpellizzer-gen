It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its thick, dark bark and dense canopy. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, often with a bluish-green hue. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by small, round, woody fruits containing a single seed. The tree is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
