    "intro": "Dianthus collinus var. minor, commonly known as the alpine pink, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters, characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of pink to red flowers with five petals, often adorned with white or pale pink markings. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
