    "intro": "Diplacus aurantiacus subsp. australis, commonly known as the red trumpetflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs. The subspecies is closely related to other Diplacus species, but it is distinguished by its more intense red floral coloration and specific geographic distribution."
