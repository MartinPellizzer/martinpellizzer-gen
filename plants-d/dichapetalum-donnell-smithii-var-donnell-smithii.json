It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence, while its flowers are usually pink or red with prominent stamens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
