    "intro": "Decaschistia peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family, which includes many species of flowering plants with showy, often tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, clustered flowers that are often pink or purple in color, and it has small, narrow leaves. Decaschistia peninsularis is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
