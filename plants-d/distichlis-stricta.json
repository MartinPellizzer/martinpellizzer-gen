    "intro": "Distichlis stricta, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to tolerate saline and windy environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and other coastal habitats. Due to its hardiness and ecological importance, it is valued for erosion control and as a component of native plant landscapes."
