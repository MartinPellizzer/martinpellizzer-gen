    "intro": "Diospyros occlusa, commonly known as the rock apple or Indian date, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that turn red when mature. Its fruit is edible and has a sweet, tart flavor, often used in local cuisines. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
