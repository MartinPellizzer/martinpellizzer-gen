    "intro": "Derris timorensis var. saharanpurensis, commonly known as the Saharanpurensis spurge, is a variant of the Derris species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and has alternate, ovate leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsule fruits. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores and is used in traditional medicine with caution."
