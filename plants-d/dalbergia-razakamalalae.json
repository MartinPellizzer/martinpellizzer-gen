    "intro": "Dalbergia razakamalalae, commonly known as the Madagascar rosewood, is a rare and endangered tree native to the eastern rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark wood with a rich, aromatic scent. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits. Due to its unique properties and limited distribution, it is highly valued in the timber trade, leading to significant conservation concerns."
