    "intro": "Dryopteris opposita var. rivulorum, commonly known as the river fern, is a variant of the opposite wood fern. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in wet conditions. The spore-bearing structures, or soruses, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus."
