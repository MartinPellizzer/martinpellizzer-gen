    "intro": "Dracophyllum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved dracophyllum, is a shrub native to the western regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often in coastal or mountainous areas. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinct aromatic scent, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Dracophyllum longifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
