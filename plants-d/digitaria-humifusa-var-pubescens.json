    "intro": "Digitaria humifusa var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the soil surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
