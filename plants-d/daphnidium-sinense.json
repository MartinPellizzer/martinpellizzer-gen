It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, resembling a cloverleaf shape. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life. Daphnidium sinense is also used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
