    "intro": "Dryopteris filix-mas var. athyriformis, commonly known as the Athyriformis male fern, is a variant of the male fern species native to parts of Asia. It is a perennial fern characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features a thick, rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. The botanical structure of this fern reflects its adaptation to forest understory conditions, where it competes for limited light and nutrients."
