    "intro": "Diodia arenosa, commonly known as sand daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its small, white to pale purple flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high salinity. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds effectively in its harsh environment. Diodia arenosa plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
