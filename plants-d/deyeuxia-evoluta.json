    "intro": "Deyeuxia evoluta, commonly known as the spreading false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Asia. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Deyeuxia evoluta is often found in disturbed or transitional wetland ecosystems."
