    "intro": "Delphinium pachycentrum var. pseudolancisepalum, commonly known as the broad-centred larkspur, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are typically palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture. This variety is distinguished by its broader, more elongated sepals compared to the typical form of D. pachycentrum. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations."
