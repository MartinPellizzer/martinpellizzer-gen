It is characterized by its long, strap-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in variable conditions. Dendrobium navicula is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
