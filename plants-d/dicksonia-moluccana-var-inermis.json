    "intro": "Dicksonia moluccana var. inermis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a striking member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Australia and New Guinea, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a tall, slender trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots, and its fronds are narrow, elongated, and often have a bluish-green hue. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobili, a characteristic feature of ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
