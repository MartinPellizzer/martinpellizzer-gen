    "intro": "Dombeya erythroxylon, commonly known as the redwood dombeya, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in forested areas with well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a hairy texture. The bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against environmental stress."
