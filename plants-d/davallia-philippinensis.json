    "intro": "Davallia philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble a floating aquatic plant, though it typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce small, ovate leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
