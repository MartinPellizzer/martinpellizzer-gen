    "intro": "Desmodium helenae, commonly known as Helen's burr. It is a flowering plant species native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its seed pods are hairy and often have a distinctive burr-like structure, which aids in seed dispersal. Desmodium helenae is often found in grasslands and open habitats, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation."
