    "intro": "Discocactus zehntneri var. albispinus, commonly known as the white-spined discocactus, is a unique cacti species native to southern Africa. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white, spiny tubercles that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
