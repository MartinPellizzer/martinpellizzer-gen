    "intro": "Dyssodia gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils, often found on gypsum outcrops. Its hairy leaves and compact growth habit help it conserve water in harsh environments. Dyssodia gypsophila is an important component of its native ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
