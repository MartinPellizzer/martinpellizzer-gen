    "intro": "Dendrobium piestocaulon var. kauloense, commonly known as the Kauloense Dendrobium, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually small, fragrant, and come in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
