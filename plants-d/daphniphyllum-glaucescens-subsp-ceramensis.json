    "intro": "Daphniphyllum glaucescens subsp. ceramensis, commonly known as the Ceram daphniphyllum, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the island of Ceram in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
