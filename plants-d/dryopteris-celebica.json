    "intro": "Dryopteris celebica, commonly known as the Celebes shield fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Indonesian archipelago. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments, often in shaded forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the growth of its tall, tree-like structure. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
