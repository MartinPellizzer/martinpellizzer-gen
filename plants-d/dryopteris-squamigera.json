    "intro": "Dryopteris squamigera, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that give it a delicate, ornamental appearance. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are often covered with a dense layer of brown, scaly tissue, which contributes to its common name. Dryopteris squamigera is popular in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
