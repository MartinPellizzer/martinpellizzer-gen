    "intro": "Dryopteris fragrans, commonly known as the sweet fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that emit a faintly sweet, vanilla-like scent when crushed. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of its reproductive biology."
