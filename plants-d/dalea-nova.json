    "intro": "Dalea nova, commonly known as the New Mexico milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Dalea nova plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
