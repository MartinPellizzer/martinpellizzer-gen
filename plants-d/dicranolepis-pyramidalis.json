    "intro": "Dicranolepis pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with closely appressed leaves that are often curved and have a distinct midrib. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. Dicranolepis pyramidalis is an important component of microhabitats in temperate and subarctic regions, contributing to soil stabilization and moisture retention."
