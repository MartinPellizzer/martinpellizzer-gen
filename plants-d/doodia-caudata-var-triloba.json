    "intro": "Doodia caudata var. triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to the eastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clustered, lance-shaped fronds that have a distinctive three-lobed appearance. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a serrated margin. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters, or sori, on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium."
