    "intro": "Dalea schaffneri, commonly known as Schaffner's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Dalea schaffneri is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands."
