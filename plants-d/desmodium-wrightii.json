    "intro": "Desmodium wrightii, commonly known as Wright's burr legume, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Desmodium wrightii is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
