    "intro": "Delphinium gracile var. glabrum, commonly known as the slender larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers with five petals. The plant has lance-shaped, glabrous (smooth) leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
