    "intro": "Dalbergia laxiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered ebony, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is notable for its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued in traditional craftsmanship. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in humid, tropical climates. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
