    "intro": "Diplazium crenulatum, commonly known as the serrated shield fern, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of India, China, and Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its erect, branched fronds that are often covered with small, serrated teeth along the edges. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Diplazium crenulatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
