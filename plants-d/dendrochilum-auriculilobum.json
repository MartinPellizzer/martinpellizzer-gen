    "intro": "Dendrochilum auriculilobum, commonly known as the ear-shaped lip orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with prominent, auriculate (ear-shaped) lip lobes that are a defining characteristic. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange with contrasting purple or brown markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
