    "intro": "Dorycnium vexillare, commonly known as the lesser burr medic, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, branching clusters, followed by distinctive burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Dorycnium vexillare is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
