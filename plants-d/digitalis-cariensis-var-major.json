    "intro": "Digitalis cariensis var. major, commonly known as the tall foxglove, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence composed of tubular, hood-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant produces a distinctive seed capsule that splits open to release its seeds, a process known as dehiscence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its striking appearance and medicinal properties, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in traditional herbal medicine."
