    "intro": "Dipterocarpus retusus var. macrocarpus, commonly known as the large-fruited dipterocarp, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall stature, reaching up to 40 meters in height, and its buttressed roots that help stabilize it in nutrient-poor soils. The tree produces large, heavy seeds enclosed in woody capsules, which are dispersed by animals. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a glossy surface. This species plays a vital role in tropical rainforest ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and carbon sequestration."
