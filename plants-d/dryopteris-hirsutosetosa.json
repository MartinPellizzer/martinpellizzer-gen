    "intro": "Dryopteris hirsutosetosa, commonly known as the hairy-stalked wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, robust fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are divided into a series of lance-shaped segments, with a distinctive hairy texture on the undersides. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests with rich, well-drained soil. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds."
