    "intro": "Dodecatheon macrocarpum, commonly known as the showy peacock flower, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It produces striking, nodding flowers with brightly colored bracts that resemble peacock feathers, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and are pollinated by insects. The showy peacock flower is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, early-season display."
