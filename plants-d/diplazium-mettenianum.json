    "intro": "Diplazium mettenianum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and have a soft, leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Diplazium mettenianum plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
