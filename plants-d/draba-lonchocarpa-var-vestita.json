    "intro": "Draba lonchocarpa var. vestita, commonly known as the white-flowered whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white to silver hairs, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
