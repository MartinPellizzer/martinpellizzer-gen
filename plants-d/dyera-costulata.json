It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Dyera costulata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an attractive species for ornamental gardening and ecological studies."
