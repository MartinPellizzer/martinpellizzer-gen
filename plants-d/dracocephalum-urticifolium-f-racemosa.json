    "intro": "Dracocephalum urticifolium f. racemosa, commonly known as the racemose form of the woolly betony, is a flowering plant characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems. It produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers arranged in racemes, which are elongated inflorescences. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a woolly appearance. This form is a variation of the species, distinguished by its more open and branched flowering structure compared to the typical form. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
