    "intro": "Dicksonia millefolium, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, light green fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a structure typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate rainforests. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora."
