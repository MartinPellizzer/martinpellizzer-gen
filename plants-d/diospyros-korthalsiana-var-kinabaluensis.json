    "intro": "Diospyros korthalsiana var. kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu persimmon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a smooth, fleshy berry that turns orange-red when mature, containing a single, hard, seed-like stone. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in shaded, humid environments within its native habitat."
