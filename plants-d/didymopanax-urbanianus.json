    "intro": "Didymopanax urbanianus, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or Brazilian walnut, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and can grow up to 30 meters in height. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by round, yellow fruits containing edible seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich, dark color, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and musical instrument industries. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species."
