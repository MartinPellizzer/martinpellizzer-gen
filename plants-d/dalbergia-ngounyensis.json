It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental and economic value, it is also subject to conservation concerns."
