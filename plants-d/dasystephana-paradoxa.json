It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is known for its unique floral structure. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Due to its rarity and distinct morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
