    "intro": "Dryopteris chlorophylla, commonly known as the green fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in lines along the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Dryopteris chlorophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens."
