    "intro": "Dorystigma, commonly known as the white sand orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in shades of white, yellow, and green. Dorystigma species typically grow in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky areas. Their roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake."
