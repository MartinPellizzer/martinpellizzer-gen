It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and small, narrow leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry inland areas. The foliage is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance."
