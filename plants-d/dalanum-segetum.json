It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, branched stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Dalanum segetum is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and morphological features."
