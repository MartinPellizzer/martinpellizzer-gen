    "intro": "Diplazium angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf staghorn fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth and distinctive fronds. The plant features a central, upright rhizome with fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl into lanceolate, serrated leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium angustifrons is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
