    "intro": "Draba chrysantha var. crassa, commonly known as the thick-leaved whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with dark green, thick, and leathery leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in elongated inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variant is distinguished by its more robust and fleshy leaves compared to the typical form of Draba chrysantha."
