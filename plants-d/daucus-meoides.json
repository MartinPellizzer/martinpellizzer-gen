    "intro": "Daucus meoides, commonly known as the meadow carrot, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to theApiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like parsley and dill. The plant features slender, branching stems with small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other carrots, though it is not closely related to the edible carrot species. Daucus meoides is often found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
