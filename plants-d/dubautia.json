    "intro": "Dubautia, commonly known as the Hawaiian iron plant, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its erect, often spiny stems and clusters of small, showy flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Dubautia species are often found in rocky or coastal areas, where they thrive in full sun. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, many species of Dubautia are now endangered or critically endangered."
