    "intro": "Doronicum dentatum, commonly known as the toothed leopard's bane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features a basal rosette of dark green, toothed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in early summer, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Doronicum dentatum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in alpine or rock garden settings."
