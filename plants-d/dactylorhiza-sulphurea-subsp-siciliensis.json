    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sulphurea subsp. siciliensis, commonly known as the Sicilian yellow orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily. It is characterized by its yellowish-green to orange-brown flower spikes, which bear numerous small, lanceolate flowers. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral morphology and ecological adaptations."
