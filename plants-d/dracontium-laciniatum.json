It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, red berries. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a starch source. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
