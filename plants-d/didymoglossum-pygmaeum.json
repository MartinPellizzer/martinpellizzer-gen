    "intro": "Didymoglossum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf thyme moss, is a small, cushion-forming moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, mat-like structure. The plant has short, acicular leaves that are often curved and covered in a layer of fine, papillate cells. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing on soil, rock, or decaying wood. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often overlooked but plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting microfauna in its ecosystem."
