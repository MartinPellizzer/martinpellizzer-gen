    "intro": "Dracocephalum tanguticum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf Chinese skullcap, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces compact clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
