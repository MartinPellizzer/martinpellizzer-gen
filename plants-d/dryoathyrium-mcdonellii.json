    "intro": "Dryoathyrium mcdonellii, commonly known as the McDonald's haircap, is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, elongated leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces spore capsules that are typically clustered at the tips of the stems, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing on soil or rock surfaces. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the moss family."
