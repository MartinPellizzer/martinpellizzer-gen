    "intro": "Dortmanna depressa, commonly known as the flat moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has a simple structure with a leafy stem and closely spaced, oval-shaped leaves. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature. Dortmanna depressa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
