    "intro": "Diapensia himalaica f. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur yellow diapensia, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its unique coloration is due to the presence of specific pigments that help it absorb limited sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
