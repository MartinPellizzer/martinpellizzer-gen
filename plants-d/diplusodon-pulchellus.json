It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
