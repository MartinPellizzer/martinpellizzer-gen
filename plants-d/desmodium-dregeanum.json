    "intro": "Desmodium dregeanum, commonly known as the velvet bean or hairy beggar's tick, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
