    "intro": "Diarthron caucasicum, commonly known as the Caucasian diarthron, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native habitat."
