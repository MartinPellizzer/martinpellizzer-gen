    "intro": "Dryopteris borbonica, commonly known as the Bourbon wood fern, is a species of fern native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its intricate fronds with a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in a tight, compact cluster. The plant's unique morphology and habitat make it an important species in the study of fern diversity in tropical ecosystems."
