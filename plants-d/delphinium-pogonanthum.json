It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowers are characterized by their distinctive spurred petals. Delphinium pogonanthum is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It is an important plant in its native ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
