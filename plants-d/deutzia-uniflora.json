    "intro": "Deutzia uniflora, commonly known as the singleflower deutzia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Deutzia uniflora is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and adaptability to various growing conditions."
