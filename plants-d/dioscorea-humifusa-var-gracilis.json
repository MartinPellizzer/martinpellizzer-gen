    "intro": "Dioscorea humifusa var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender yam, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with hairy, slender stems that can reach lengths of several meters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by tuberous roots that are used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that contain several seeds. The slender yam is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial shade."
