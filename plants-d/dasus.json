    "intro": "Dasus, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae, consists of shrubs and trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that are typically tubular or spurred in shape. The leaves are usually opposite or whorled, and the stems are often woody with a milky sap. Many species of Dasus are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Some species are also cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and flowers."
