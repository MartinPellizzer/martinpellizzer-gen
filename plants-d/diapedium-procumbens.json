    "intro": "Diapedium procumbens, commonly known as the creeping diapedium, is a low-growing, perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Africa. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Diapedium procumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
