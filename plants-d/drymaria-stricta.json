    "intro": "Drymaria stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has small, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its stems are usually prostrate or ascending, often rooting at the nodes to form dense mats. Drymaria stricta is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
