    "intro": "Davallia foeniculacea, commonly known as the hare\u2019s foot fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that resemble the paw prints of a hare, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stolons that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a leathery texture, while the sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Davallia foeniculacea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
