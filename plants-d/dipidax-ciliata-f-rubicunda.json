    "intro": "Dipidax ciliata f. rubicunda, commonly known as the red-fringed thistle, is a variant of the species Dipidax ciliata, characterized by its striking red bracts. This plant is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The leaves are typically narrow and spiny, with a distinctive silver or grayish underside. The inflorescence consists of purple to blue flowers surrounded by showy, red, woolly bracts that give it its common name. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
