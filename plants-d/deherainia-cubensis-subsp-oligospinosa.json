    "intro": "Deherainia cubensis subsp. oligospinosa, commonly known as the Cuban spiny pisonia, is a flowering plant native to Cuba. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny calyx that encloses its showy, pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and palmate leaves. Its flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. This subspecies is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
