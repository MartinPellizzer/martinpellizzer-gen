    "intro": "Damrongia purpureolineata, commonly known as the purple-line orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple and green striped petals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, producing a delicate and fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Damrongia purpureolineata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
