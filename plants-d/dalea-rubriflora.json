    "intro": "Dalea rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of bright red, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is well adapted to arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky slopes. Dalea rubriflora plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
