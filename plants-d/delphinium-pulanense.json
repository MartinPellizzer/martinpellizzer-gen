    "intro": "Delphinium pulanense, commonly known as the Pulan larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and it produces elongated seed pods that release tiny seeds in the wind. Delphinium pulanense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids that require careful handling."
