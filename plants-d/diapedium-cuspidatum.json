    "intro": "Diapedium cuspidatum, commonly known as the sharp-pointed diapedium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features slender, upright stems that are often reddish in color and covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive sharp tip, contributing to its common name. Diapedium cuspidatum thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
