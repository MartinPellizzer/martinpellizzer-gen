    "intro": "Dendrobium plicatum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pleated, and often zigzag-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with red or purple markings. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Dendrobium plicatum is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
