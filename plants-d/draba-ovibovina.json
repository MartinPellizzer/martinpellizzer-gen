    "intro": "Draba ovibovina, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, basal rosette of oblanceolate leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. This species is typically found in alpine and arctic regions, thriving in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Draba ovibovina is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season, often flowering in late summer. Its morphology and habitat reflect its ecological niche in harsh, mountainous environments."
