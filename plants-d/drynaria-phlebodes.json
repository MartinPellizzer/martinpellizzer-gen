    "intro": "Drynaria phlebodes, commonly known as the bamboo fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that resemble bamboo in appearance. The plant typically grows on cliffs or rocky outcrops, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense mats, contributing to its ability to colonize difficult terrain. The leaves are pinnately compound, with a delicate, feathery texture that adds to its ornamental appeal."
