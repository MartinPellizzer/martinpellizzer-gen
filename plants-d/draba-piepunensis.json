    "intro": "Draba piepunensis, commonly known as the Piepuns Valley whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has a compact, low-growing habit. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Draba piepunensis is adapted to harsh conditions and is an example of the unique flora found in high-altitude ecosystems."
