    "intro": "Dolicholobium ulawaense, commonly known as the Ulawa dolicholobium, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated pods and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, forested habitats and has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from pale yellow to reddish-brown, which attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
