    "intro": "Drypetes leonensis, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by orange-red fruits containing sticky, fleshy seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
