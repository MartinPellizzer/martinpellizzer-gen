    "intro": "Dryopteris oligophylloides, commonly known as the small-leaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The fronds are deeply divided into narrow, linear segments, giving the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sorangia."
