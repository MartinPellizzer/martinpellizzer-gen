    "intro": "Dendrobium imitator, commonly known as the mimic orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that are covered in clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its flowers are often mistaken for those of other orchid species due to their similar appearance. Dendrobium imitator thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
