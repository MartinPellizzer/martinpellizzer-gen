    "intro": "Dryopteris subattenuata, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The slender wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
