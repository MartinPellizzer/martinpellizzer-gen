    "intro": "Diplostephium umbelliferum, commonly known as the Mexican umbrella plant, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive umbellate inflorescence, which consists of multiple small white or yellow flowers clustered together. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
