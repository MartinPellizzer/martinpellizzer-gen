It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Dalea bacchantum thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. It is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
