    "intro": "Davallia bidentata, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stolons that allow it to spread across the forest floor. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, feathery texture. Davallia bidentata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
