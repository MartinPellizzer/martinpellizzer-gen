    "intro": "Discoclaoxylon occidentale var. pubescens, commonly known as the western pubescent discocladon, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Ginkgoaceae. It is characterized by its unique, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant exhibits a distinctive pubescent (hairy) texture on its stems and young leaves, which is a notable botanical feature. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is considered a relict species with a limited geographic distribution. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
