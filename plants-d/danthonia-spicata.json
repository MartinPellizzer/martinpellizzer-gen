    "intro": "Danthonia spicata, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental and erosion control purposes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to its ecological resilience."
