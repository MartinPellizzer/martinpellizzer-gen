    "intro": "Dendrobium planum, commonly known as the bare- stemmed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, wiry stems that often remain bare of leaves except for the flowering spikes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium planum is popular among orchid growers for its hardiness and elegant appearance."
