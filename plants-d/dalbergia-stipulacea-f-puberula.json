    "intro": "Dalbergia stipulacea f. puberula, commonly known as the velvetwood or velvet tamarind, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-brown bark and trifoliate leaves with hairy undersides, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
