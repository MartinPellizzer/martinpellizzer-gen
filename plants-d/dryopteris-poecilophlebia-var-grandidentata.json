    "intro": "Dryopteris poecilophlebia var. grandidentata, commonly known as the giant fern or broad-crested wood fern, is a variant of the broad-crested fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are bipinnate, with long, slender pinnae that are often slightly curved and have a broad, rounded shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
