    "intro": "Draba wahlenbergii var. gelida, commonly known as the Arctic whitlow grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Arctic and alpine zones. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are typically basal, linear, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its harsh environment."
