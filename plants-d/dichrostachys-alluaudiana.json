    "intro": "Dichrostachys alluaudiana, commonly known as the African burr or red burr, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves and produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds with a tuft of silky hair. The plant is often found in savannas and dry woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. It has been introduced to other regions, including parts of the Caribbean and the southern United States, where it sometimes becomes invasive. Its rapid growth and ability to withstand drought make it an important species in ecological and agricultural contexts."
