    "intro": "Dioscorea hyalinomarginata, commonly known as the glass-margin yam, is a species of tuberous vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy, glassy margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits containing numerous seeds. Its tuberous roots are edible and have been used traditionally in some cultures for food and medicinal purposes. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
