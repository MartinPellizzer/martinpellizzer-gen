    "intro": "Drosera katangensis, commonly known as the Katanga Sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Droseraceae family and is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are usually small and rosette-shaped, with a bright red coloration that helps attract prey. Drosera katangensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
