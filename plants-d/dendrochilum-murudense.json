    "intro": "Dendrochilum murudense, commonly known as the Murudense Tree Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with reddish markings. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Dendrochilum murudense plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators."
