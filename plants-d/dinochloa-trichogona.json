    "intro": "Dinochloa trichogona, commonly known as the hairy grass or dwarf hairgrass, is a small, low-growing plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and often thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively. Dinochloa trichogona is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
