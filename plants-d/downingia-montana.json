    "intro": "Downingia montana, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, white down. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by insects. Downingia montana thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a notable species within its ecosystem."
