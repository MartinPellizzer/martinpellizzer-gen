    "intro": "Diplodium brumale, commonly known as the winter diplodium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture during dry periods. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late winter or early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Diplodium brumale is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Its botanical features make it a unique and resilient species within its native habitat."
