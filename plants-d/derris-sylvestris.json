    "intro": "Derris sylvestris, commonly known as the wild senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is notable for containing rotenone, a toxic compound used in traditional insecticides. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, and the plant plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
