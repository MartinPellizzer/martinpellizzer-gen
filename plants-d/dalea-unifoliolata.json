    "intro": "Dalea unifoliolata, commonly known as the single leaf Dalea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique, single leaflet and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insects. Its adaptations to drought and heat make it an important species in xerophytic landscapes."
