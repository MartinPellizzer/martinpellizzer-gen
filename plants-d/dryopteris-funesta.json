    "intro": "Dryopteris funesta, commonly known as the black holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored dust. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodland areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant's unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
