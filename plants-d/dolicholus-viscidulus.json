    "intro": "Dolicholus viscidulus, commonly known as the sticky leaf vine, is a tropical plant characterized by its climbing habit and distinctive, waxy leaves. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape and are covered in a fine, sticky coating that helps deter herbivores. This plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
