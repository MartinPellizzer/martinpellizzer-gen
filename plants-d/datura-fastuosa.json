    "intro": "Datura fastuosa, commonly known as the sacred datura, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces spiny, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it a member of the nightshade family. Its leaves are typically broad and lobed, and the plant thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Datura fastuosa is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is often described as similar to rotting meat."
