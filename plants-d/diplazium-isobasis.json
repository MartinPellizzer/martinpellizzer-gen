    "intro": "Diplazium isobasis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically slender and arching. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates like soil or rock. The leaves are usually bright green and can be used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
