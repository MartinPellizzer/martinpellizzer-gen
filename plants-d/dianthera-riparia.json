    "intro": "Dianthera riparia, commonly known as the water bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, pond edges, and along streams, thriving in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant features showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often floating on the water's surface or submerged. Dianthera riparia plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life."
