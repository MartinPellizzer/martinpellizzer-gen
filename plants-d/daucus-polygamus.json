    "intro": "Daucus polygamus, commonly known as the wild carrot or Queen Anne's lace, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like parsley and dill. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and an umbel of white flowers that resemble a lace doily. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed structure called a schizocarp, which releases small, curved seeds. Daucus polygamus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
