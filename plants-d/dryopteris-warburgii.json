    "intro": "Dryopteris warburgii, commonly known as the Warburg's wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a slender and arching growth habit. Native to the temperate regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments. The fronds are usually dark green and have a subtle, fern-like texture, with small, rounded pinnae. It is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
