    "intro": "Diemisa stricta, commonly known as the rigid diemisa, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features narrow, upright leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
