It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of long, pinnate leaves that resemble the blades of a windmill. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is valued in both horticulture and conservation efforts."
