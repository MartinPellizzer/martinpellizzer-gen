    "intro": "Dyssodia acerosa, commonly known as the hard-leaved dyssodia, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its rigid, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing a degree of drought resistance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Dyssodia acerosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and hardy nature."
