It is a member of the Arecaceae family, commonly known as the palm family, and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces striking, feather-like leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy texture. It also bears small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by distinctive, elongated fruits. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
