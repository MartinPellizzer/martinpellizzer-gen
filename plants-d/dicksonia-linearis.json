    "intro": "Dicksonia linearis, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a dense, fibrous mat, helping to stabilize the soil. Its fronds are dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in shape and structure. Dicksonia linearis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas."
