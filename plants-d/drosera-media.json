    "intro": "Drosera media, commonly known as the common sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested to supplement its nutrient intake. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of mucilage. Drosera media produces small, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months."
