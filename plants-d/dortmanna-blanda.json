    "intro": "Dortmanna blanda, commonly known as the smooth dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Dortmanna blanda thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
