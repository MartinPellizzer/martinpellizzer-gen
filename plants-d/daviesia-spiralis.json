    "intro": "Daviesia spiralis, commonly known as the spiral daviesia, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in heathlands and rocky soils, characterized by its wiry, spiral-like stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Daviesia spiralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
