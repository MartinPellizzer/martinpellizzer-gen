    "intro": "Dryopteris paleacea, commonly known as the pale maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. The pale coloration of its fronds is a distinctive botanical feature that sets it apart from other fern species."
