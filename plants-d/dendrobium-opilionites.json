    "intro": "Dendrobium opilionites, commonly known as the Orchid of the Sea, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length, with clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Dendrobium opilionites is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
