It features a short, cylindrical stem with spines and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers are typically borne at the stem tips and are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry climates."
