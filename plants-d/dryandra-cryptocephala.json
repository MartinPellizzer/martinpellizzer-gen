    "intro": "Dryandra cryptocephala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dryandra, is a species of shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and striking, cone-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. It is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
