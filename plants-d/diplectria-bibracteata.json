    "intro": "Diplectria bibracteata, commonly known as the two-bracted orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes two bracts at the base of the flower. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its flowers are usually small and white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
