    "intro": "Digitaria commutata subsp. eriantha, commonly known as the hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue or greenish flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a potential forage species."
