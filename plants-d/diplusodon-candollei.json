It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its erect stem, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal.
