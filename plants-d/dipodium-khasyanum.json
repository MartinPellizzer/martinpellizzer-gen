    "intro": "Dipodium khasyanum, commonly known as the Khasi orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, thriving in the undergrowth of tropical and subtropical regions. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
