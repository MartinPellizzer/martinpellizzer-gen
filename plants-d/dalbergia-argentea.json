    "intro": "Dalbergia argentea, commonly known as silverwood tree, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elongated, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in terminal clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests. The tree is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments."
