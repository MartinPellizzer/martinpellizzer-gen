    "intro": "Dehaasia sumbaensis, commonly known as the Sumba sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the island of Sumba in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Dehaasia sumbaensis is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun conditions."
