    "intro": "Dryopteris kuratae, commonly known as Kurata's wood fern, is a species of fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are usually dark green and have a leathery texture."
