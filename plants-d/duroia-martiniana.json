    "intro": "Duroia martiniana, commonly known as the Martin's durio, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and often have a glossy appearance, adapting to the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat. While not widely cultivated for fruit, it plays a role in the ecological balance of its native ecosystems."
