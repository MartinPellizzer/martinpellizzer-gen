    "intro": "Dasyanthina palustris, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, upright stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
