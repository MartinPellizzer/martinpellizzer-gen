    "intro": "Delphinium pubescens, commonly known as the downy larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Delphinium pubescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
