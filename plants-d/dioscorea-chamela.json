    "intro": "Dioscorea chamela, commonly known as the Mexican yam, is a climbing vine native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by tuberous roots that are often used in traditional medicine. Its tubers are edible when properly prepared and have a starchy, somewhat sweet flavor. Dioscorea chamela is also valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit."
