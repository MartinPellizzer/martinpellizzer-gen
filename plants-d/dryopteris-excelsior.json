    "intro": "Dryopteris excelsior, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of North America. It features fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, elongated shape resembling a sword. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients effectively. The fronds are deciduous, with the fertile fronds appearing in late summer and early autumn."
