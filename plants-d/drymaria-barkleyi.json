    "intro": "Drymaria barkleyi, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Drymaria barkleyi plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
