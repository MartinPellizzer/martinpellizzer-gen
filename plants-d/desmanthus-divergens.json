    "intro": "Desmanthus divergens, commonly known as the slender burr legume, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, spiny pods that contain small, rounded seeds. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open fields. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, and it is adapted to warm, dry climates. Desmanthus divergens is also valued for its potential as a forage plant for livestock."
