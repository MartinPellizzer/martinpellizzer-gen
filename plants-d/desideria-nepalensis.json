    "intro": "Desideria nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal desideria, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky and mountainous areas, adapting to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
