    "intro": "Doxomma macrostachyum, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, showy flowers. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant features broad, palmate leaves and produces clusters of orange-red, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. Its rapid growth rate and dramatic floral display make it a popular ornamental species in warm climates. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread."
