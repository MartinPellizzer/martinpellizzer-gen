    "intro": "Draba tomentosa var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada draba, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in tight, compact inflorescences. Its leaves are usually basal, with a distinctive pubescent texture, and it is often found in open meadows and talus slopes. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
