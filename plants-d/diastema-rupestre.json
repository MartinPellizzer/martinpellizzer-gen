    "intro": "Diastema rupestre, commonly known as the rock diastema, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to survive in poor soils and can withstand drought conditions due to its succulent stems. Diastema rupestre is often used in xeriscaping and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry garden settings."
