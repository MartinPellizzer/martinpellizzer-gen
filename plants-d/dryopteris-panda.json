    "intro": "Dryopteris panda, commonly known as the panda fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of southern China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often adorned with a unique pattern resembling the black-and-white markings of a panda. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates, while its spores are released from specialized structures called sori. The panda fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage."
