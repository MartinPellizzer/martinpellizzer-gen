    "intro": "Dryopteris denticulata var. aperta, commonly known as the open marginal wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is a deciduous fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features fronds that are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, open appearance at the margins. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in lines along the veins. This variety is characterized by its delicate, finely toothed leaves and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
