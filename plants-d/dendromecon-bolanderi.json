    "intro": "Dendromecon bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's brittlebush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes poppies and other flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its erect, branching stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Dendromecon bolanderi thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats."
