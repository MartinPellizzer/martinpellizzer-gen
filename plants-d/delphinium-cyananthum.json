    "intro": "Delphinium cyananthum, commonly known as the blue-flowered larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, with a rough texture. Delphinium cyananthum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens."
