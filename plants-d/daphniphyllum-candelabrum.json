    "intro": "Daphniphyllum candelabrum, commonly known as the candlestick holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its striking, candle-like clusters of small, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that persist into winter. It is well adapted to cool, moist climates and prefers partial to full shade. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in shaded landscapes."
