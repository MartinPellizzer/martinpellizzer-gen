    "intro": "Dendrobium phragmitoides, commonly known as the reed-like orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a unique growth habit with long, cane-like pseudobulbs that resemble reeds, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are usually linear and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
