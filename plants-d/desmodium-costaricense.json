    "intro": "Desmodium costaricense, commonly known as the Costa Rican burr legume, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that are hairy and often have a hooked or spiny structure, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas."
