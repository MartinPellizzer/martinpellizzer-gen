It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale green. The plant produces dark blue, waxy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and turn a striking reddish hue in the fall. Disporum smilacinum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories."
