    "intro": "Daemonorops kurziana, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a member of the cycad family (Cycadaceae) and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a large, evergreen plant that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and stout, unbranched trunk. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal maintenance once established. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens."
