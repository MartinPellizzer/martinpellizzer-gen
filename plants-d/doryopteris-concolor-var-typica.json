    "intro": "Doryopteris concolor var. typica, commonly known as the common fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
