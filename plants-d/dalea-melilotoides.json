    "intro": "Dalea melilotoides, commonly known as the sweet caraway or false melilot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes, and is often found in disturbed soils. Dalea melilotoides is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a nectar source for pollinators."
