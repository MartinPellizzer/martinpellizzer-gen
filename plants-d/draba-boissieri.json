It is a small, herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in rocky or disturbed soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Its rapid growth and short life cycle make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
