    "intro": "Dendrobium stuposum, commonly known as the Stuposum orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern. Dendrobium stuposum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
