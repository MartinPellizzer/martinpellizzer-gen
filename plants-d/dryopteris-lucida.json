    "intro": "Dryopteris lucida, commonly known as the shining wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The leaves are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The plant produces small, spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its fronds."
