    "intro": "Duvalia, commonly known as the \"dwarf lily\" or \"false lily,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Iridaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plants are perennial, growing from corms, and produce showy, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. Duvalia species are typically low-growing, with narrow, grass-like leaves and are popular in rock gardens and coastal landscapes. They are known for their resilience to drought and poor soil conditions, making them easy to cultivate in many environments."
