    "intro": "Dryopteris koordersii, commonly known as the Koord's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light to medium green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
