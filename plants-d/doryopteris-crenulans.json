    "intro": "Doryopteris crenulans, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, frond-like structures that resemble leaves, with a serrated margin and a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its reproductive structures are spore-bearing, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a decorative plant in humid climates."
