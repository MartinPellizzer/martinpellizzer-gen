    "intro": "Diospyros glaucescens, commonly known as the white persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round, orange to red fruits. The fruits are edible when fully ripe and have a sweet, sometimes astringent flavor. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production in tropical and subtropical regions."
