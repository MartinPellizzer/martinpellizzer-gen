    "intro": "Deflersia, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Deflersia produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ethereal appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists alike."
