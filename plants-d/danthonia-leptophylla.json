    "intro": "Danthonia leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is found in various habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Danthonia leptophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
