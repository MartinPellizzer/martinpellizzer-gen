    "intro": "Davallia tripinnata, commonly known as the hare's foot fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that resemble a hare's foot, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders. The fronds are evergreen, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, feathery appearance."
