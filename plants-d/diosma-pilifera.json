    "intro": "Diosma pilifera, commonly known as the silky diosma, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its unique feature is the presence of silky, hair-like structures on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. Diosma pilifera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
