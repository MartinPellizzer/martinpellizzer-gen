    "intro": "Desmanthus nutans, commonly known as the nodding desmanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Desmanthus nutans plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
