    "intro": "Dendrobium kiauense, commonly known as the Kiuang orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered with clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive fragrance, and bloom during the wet season. Dendrobium kiauense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
