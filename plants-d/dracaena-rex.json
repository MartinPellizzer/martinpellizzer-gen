It features broad, dark green, lance-shaped leaves with prominent white and yellow variegation, creating a dramatic visual effect. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are rarely seen in cultivation. Dracaena rex thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental use."
