    "intro": "Draba incana var. axillaris, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features small, basal leaves that are hairy and often have a bluish-green hue, while its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variety is notable for its hibernating ability, allowing it to survive harsh winter conditions."
