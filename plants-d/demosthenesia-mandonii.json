    "intro": "Demosthenesia mandonii, commonly known as the Mandonii bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, rounded fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
