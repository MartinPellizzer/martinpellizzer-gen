    "intro": "Davallia manilensis, commonly known as the Manila fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emerge from a creeping rhizome system. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive, lacy appearance that gives it an ornamental quality. Davallia manilensis is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
