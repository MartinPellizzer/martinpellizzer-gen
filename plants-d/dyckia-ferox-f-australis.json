    "intro": "Dyckia ferox f. australis, commonly known as the Southern Ferox Dyckia, is a compact, evergreen bromeliad native to southern South America. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color with a waxy coating. The plant produces striking red or orange inflorescences that emerge from the center of the rosette. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its hardy nature and ornamental appearance make it a valuable addition to both indoor and outdoor landscapes."
