    "intro": "Diplemium carolinianum, commonly known as the Carolina marsh fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wet, swampy areas and thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces upright, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland habitats."
