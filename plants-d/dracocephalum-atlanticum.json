    "intro": "Dracocephalum atlanticum, commonly known as Atlantic skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along dunes and maritime cliffs, thriving in saline and well-drained environments. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
