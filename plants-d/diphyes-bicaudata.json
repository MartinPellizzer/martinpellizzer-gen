    "intro": "Diphyes bicaudata, commonly known as the two-tailed orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive two-tailed appearance, with elongated, hairy bracts at the base of its flowering spikes. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink, often arranged in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many countries."
