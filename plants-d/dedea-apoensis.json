    "intro": "Dedea apoensis, commonly known as the Apo mountain cycad, is a unique plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant is adapted to the humid, tropical conditions of the high-altitude regions of Mount Apo. It plays a significant role in the local ecosystem as a source of food for various insects and animals. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Dedea apoensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
