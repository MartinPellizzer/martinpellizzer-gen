    "intro": "Deschampsia baicalensis, commonly known as the Baikal hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold regions of Asia, particularly Mongolia and Siberia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental grass for its delicate appearance and resilience."
