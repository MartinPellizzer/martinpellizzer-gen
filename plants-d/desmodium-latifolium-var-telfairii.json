    "intro": "Desmodium latifolium var. telfairii, commonly known as Telfair's sicklepod, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being broadly ovate with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads. Its seed pods are elongated and curved, resembling a sickle, hence the common name. The species is adapted to moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
