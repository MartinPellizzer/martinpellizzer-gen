    "intro": "Dioscorea pulverea, commonly known as the African yambean, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, green flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and twining. The tubers are valued for their starchy content and have been traditionally used in various cultures for food and herbal remedies."
