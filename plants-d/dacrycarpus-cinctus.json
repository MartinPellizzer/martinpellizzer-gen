    "intro": "Dacrycarpus cinctus, commonly known as the New Zealand conifer or the kahikatea, is a tall evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its long, slender leaves and conical shape. The plant has a unique ability to grow in wetland environments, often forming dense forests in swampy areas. Its cones are small and clustered, and it plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's native ecosystems. The tree is also notable for its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils, making it a key species in the country's wetland habitats."
