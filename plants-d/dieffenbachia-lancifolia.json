    "intro": "Dieffenbachia lancifolia, commonly known as the Shingle Plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often marked with white or cream-colored veins. The plant has a stout, upright stem and produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by green, spiky fruits. Its foliage is highly ornamental, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
