    "intro": "Diplocaulobium lageniforme, commonly known as the bottle-shaped liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Ptilidiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, bottle-shaped thallus that is often covered in a layer of fine, translucent cells. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or in damp soil. It is a non-vascular plant, relying on diffusion for the transport of water and nutrients. Its morphology and habitat make it an important indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
