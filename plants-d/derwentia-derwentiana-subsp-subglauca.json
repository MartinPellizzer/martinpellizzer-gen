    "intro": "Derwentia derwentiana subsp. subglauca, commonly known as the subglaucescent Derwentia, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery bloom, giving them a bluish-gray appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
