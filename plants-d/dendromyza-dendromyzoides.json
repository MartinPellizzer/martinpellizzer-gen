    "intro": "Dendromyza dendromyzoides, commonly known as the tree lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga. It thrives on the bark of trees in humid, shaded environments, forming a composite structure that appears as a crust or foliose growth. The plant's botanical structure is characterized by its thallus, which lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. It plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often used as an indicator species for forest health."
