    "intro": "Digitaria baileyi, commonly known as the Bailey's digitaria, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains of seeds. It is often found in areas with high moisture levels and is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich soils."
