    "intro": "Dactylorhiza urvilleana subsp. ilgazica, commonly known as the Ilgaz orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in Turkey. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulbous structure, typical of many orchid species, and produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive violet or purple coloration. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. It is classified as a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss. Its botanical significance lies in its unique ecological niche and its role in the biodiversity of its native region."
