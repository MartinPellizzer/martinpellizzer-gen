    "intro": "Diplazium roemerianum var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical regions. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that arise from a creeping rhizome. The fronds are typically shorter and more compact compared to the standard variety, with a glossy, dark green appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors. This plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
