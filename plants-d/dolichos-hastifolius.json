    "intro": "Dolichos hastifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dolichos, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features pinnately compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for its foliage and potential medicinal properties."
