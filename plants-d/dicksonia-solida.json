    "intro": "Dicksonia solida, commonly known as the hard tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique structure with a central trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy material called the rachis. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow in the dark. Dicksonia solida is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
