    "intro": "Dryopteris limbata, commonly known as the rock shield fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that form a rosette shape, often growing in rocky or shaded environments. The fronds are typically dark green with a leathery texture and are adorned with small, tooth-like serrations along the edges. This fern thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in forested areas or on rocky outcrops. Its ability to tolerate shade makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and rockeries."
