    "intro": "Dendroarabis fruticulosa, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. Its flowers are typically tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Dendroarabis fruticulosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in drought conditions."
