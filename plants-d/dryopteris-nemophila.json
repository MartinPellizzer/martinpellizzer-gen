    "intro": "Dryopteris nemophila, commonly known as the forest maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and often have a slightly curled appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually through the forest floor. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
