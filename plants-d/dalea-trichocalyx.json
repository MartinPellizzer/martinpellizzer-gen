    "intro": "Dalea trichocalyx, commonly known as the threadleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in grasslands and rocky soils. It has compound leaves with fine, thread-like leaflets, and its root system is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Dalea trichocalyx plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
