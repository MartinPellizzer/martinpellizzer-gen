    "intro": "Dianthus glacialis subsp. gelidus, commonly known as the alpine pink, is a flowering plant native to the high mountain regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine habitats."
