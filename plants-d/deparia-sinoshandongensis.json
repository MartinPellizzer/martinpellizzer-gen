    "intro": "Deparia sinoshandongensis, commonly known as the Shandong wood fern, is a rare species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, preferring rich, humus-filled soils. Its spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
