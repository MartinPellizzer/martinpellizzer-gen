    "intro": "Dryas pentapetala, commonly known as the mountain avens, is a flowering plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of silver-white, hairy leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, typical of the Rosaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to low temperatures and strong winds. Dryas pentapetala plays an important role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
