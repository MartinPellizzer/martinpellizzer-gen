    "intro": "Drosera variegata, commonly known as the variegated sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are often variegated, featuring a mix of green and red or pink hues. Drosera variegata is a low-growing species that thrives in cool, humid conditions."
