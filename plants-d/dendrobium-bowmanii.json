    "intro": "Dendrobium bowmanii, commonly known as the Bowman's orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its clustered, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated for both horticultural and conservation purposes."
