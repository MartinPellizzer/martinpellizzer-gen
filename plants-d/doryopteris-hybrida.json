    "intro": "Doryopteris hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are dark green and often have a slightly curled appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Doryopteris hybrida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush, foliage."
