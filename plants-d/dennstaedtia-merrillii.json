It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is notable for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
