    "intro": "Digitaria collina, commonly known as silverleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-ranked spikelets. Digitaria collina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
