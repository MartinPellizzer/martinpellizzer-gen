It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds. Dilepis is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain regions."
