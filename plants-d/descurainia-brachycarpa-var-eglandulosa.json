    "intro": "Descurainia brachycarpa var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular shortpoded lesquerella, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its fruit is a short, dehiscent pod. It has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers are often visited by pollinators like bees. This variant is characterized by the presence of glandular structures on its leaves and stems, which may play a role in defense against herbivores."
