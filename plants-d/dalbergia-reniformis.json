    "intro": "Dalbergia reniformis, commonly known as rosewood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its density and fine grain. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by flat, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
