    "intro": "Dorycnium argenteum, commonly known as silver vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces slender, spiny pods that contain several seeds, and it thrives in dry, calcareous soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has potential uses in soil stabilization and as a forage plant."
