    "intro": "Diplocaulobium isthmiferum, commonly known as the Isthmian marsh fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining wetland biodiversity."
