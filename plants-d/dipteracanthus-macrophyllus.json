    "intro": "Dipteracanthus macrophyllus, commonly known as the broad-leafed dipteracanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
