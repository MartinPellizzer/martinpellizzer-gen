It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are compound, with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are often hairy. Delphinium brevisepalum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
