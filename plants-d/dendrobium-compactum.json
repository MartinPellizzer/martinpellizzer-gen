    "intro": "Dendrobium compactum, commonly known as the compact orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact growth habit with short, fleshy stems and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to store water in its native tropical environment. Dendrobium compactum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
