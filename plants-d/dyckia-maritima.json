    "intro": "Dyckia maritima, commonly known as the sea dyckia, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in terminal clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Dyckia maritima is well adapted to salty, windy environments and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Its ability to thrive in harsh coastal conditions makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
