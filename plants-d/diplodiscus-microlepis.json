    "intro": "Diplodiscus microlepis, commonly known as the small-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes form dense mats, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for small aquatic organisms. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in freshwater ecosystems."
