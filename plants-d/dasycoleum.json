    "intro": "Dasycoleum, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in North America. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces a milky sap that is toxic to some animals. Dasycoleum plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, which rely on its foliage for laying eggs. Its ability to thrive in moist soils makes it a common sight in marshes and along stream banks."
