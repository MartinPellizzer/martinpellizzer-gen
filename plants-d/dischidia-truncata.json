    "intro": "Dischidia truncata, commonly known as the globose fig or bladder fig, is a climbing or trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, and often swollen stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in leaf axils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a waxy coating. Dischidia truncata is popular as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its unique, ornamental appearance."
