    "intro": "Drosera darwinensis, commonly known as Darwin's sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Tasmania. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested to provide nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette shape. Drosera darwinensis produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months."
