    "intro": "Dryopteris barteriana, commonly known as the Barter's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris barteriana thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
