    "intro": "Deguelia spanogheana, commonly known as the red bean tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its striking red to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are used as a legume in some regions. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Deguelia spanogheana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other tropical regions for horticultural purposes."
