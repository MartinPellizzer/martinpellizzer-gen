    "intro": "Drosera kaieteurensis, commonly known as the Kaieteure pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the Kaieteure National Park in Guyana. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces a single, urn-shaped flower that is typically red or orange in color. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires high humidity and bright light. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
