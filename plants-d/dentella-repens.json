    "intro": "Dentella repens, commonly known as the creeping dentate, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Dentella repens is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in rich, organic soil."
