    "intro": "Disporum chinense var. longipedunculatum, commonly known as the long-peduncled disporum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces berries that mature to a dark blue color. Native to eastern Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its elongated peduncles, which support its floral clusters."
