    "intro": "Delphinium elatum var. pictum, commonly known as the painted larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue, purple, or white flowers with distinctive markings. The foliage consists of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. This variety is particularly noted for its vibrant, showy blooms that appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and cottage gardens."
