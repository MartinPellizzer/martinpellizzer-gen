It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and are arranged in terminal clusters. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain seeds with tufts of silky hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture with serrated edges. Dombeya grandifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
