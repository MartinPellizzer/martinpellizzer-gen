    "intro": "Drymaria cordata var. pacifica, commonly known as Pacific sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It features small, fleshy, oval leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in sandy, coastal soils. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with five petals, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its succulent stems and leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and saline environments. It is often found in dunes, rocky shores, and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion."
