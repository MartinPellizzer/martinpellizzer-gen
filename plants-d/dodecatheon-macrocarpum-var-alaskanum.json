    "intro": "Dodecatheon macrocarpum var. alaskanum, commonly known as the Alaska glory-of-the-snow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the subarctic regions of North America. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands or alpine meadows. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. This variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and shorter stems compared to the typical form of Dodecatheon macrocarpum."
