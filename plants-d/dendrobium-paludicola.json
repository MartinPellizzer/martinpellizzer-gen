    "intro": "Dendrobium paludicola, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in wet, shaded environments such as forests and bogs, where it attaches itself to trees or rocks. The plant has long, thin stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often with clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid air and decaying organic matter. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
