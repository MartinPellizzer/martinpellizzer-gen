It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
