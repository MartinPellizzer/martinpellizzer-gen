    "intro": "Dryopteris coarctata var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed rock fern, is a variant of the narrow-leaf wood fern. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features a compact, rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it anchor in rocky or shaded habitats. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with closely spaced, lanceolate pinnae that are often slightly curled. This fern thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or rocky crevices."
