    "intro": "Dalbergia acuta, commonly known as the acute or narrow-leaf bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its compound leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable species for reforestation and soil stabilization. The wood of Dalbergia acuta is hard and durable, though it is not as highly valued as other Dalbergia species for furniture or carving."
