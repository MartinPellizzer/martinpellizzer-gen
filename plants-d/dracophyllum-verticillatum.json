The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cool, humid climates. Dracophyllum verticillatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover."
