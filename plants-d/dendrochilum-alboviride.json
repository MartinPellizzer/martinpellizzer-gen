    "intro": "Dendrochilum alboviride, commonly known as the white-green dendrochilum, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with elongated pseudobulbs that bear leaves and flowers. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, greenish-white flowers that have a subtle fragrance. Its foliage is typically broad and ovate, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Dendrochilum alboviride is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation under proper conditions."
