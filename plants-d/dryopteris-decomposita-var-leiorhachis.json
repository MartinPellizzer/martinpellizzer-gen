    "intro": "Dryopteris decomposita var. leiorhachis, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a variant of the rockcap fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, golden-yellow fronds that contrast with its dark green base, creating a striking visual effect. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often curled and tightly packed. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
