    "intro": "Dryopteris tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than a meter in length, with a finely divided, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots throughout the growing season. The foliage remains green year-round, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in temperate climates."
