    "intro": "Dryopteris aculeata subsp. lobata, commonly known as the lobate wood fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that are often described as having a \"butterfly\" shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The spores are released from sori that are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
