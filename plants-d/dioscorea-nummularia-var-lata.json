    "intro": "Dioscorea nummularia var. lata, commonly known as the broadleaf yam, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or wetlands, and has heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are usually small and borne in clusters, and the plant produces edible tubers that are similar in appearance to other yam species. The varietal form 'lata' is distinguished by its broader, more spreading leaves compared to the typical variety."
