    "intro": "Davallia schlechtendalii, commonly known as the silver-veined fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, arching fronds with a light green color and distinctive silver veins that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique characteristic that aids in nighttime pollination. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its elegant appearance."
