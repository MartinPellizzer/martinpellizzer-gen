    "intro": "Dryopteris varia var. saxifraga, commonly known as the saxifrage fern, is a variant of the variable wood fern. It is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States, typically found in rocky or shaded forest environments. The plant features a slender, upright rhizome with a dense cluster of lance-shaped, dark green fronds. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. The plant's adaptability to poor soil conditions makes it a hardy and resilient species in woodland habitats."
