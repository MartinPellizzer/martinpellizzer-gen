    "intro": "Dracaena salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf dracaena, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that resemble willow leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, which are edible for some bird species. Dracaena salicifolia thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its slow growth rate and attractive foliage make it a favored ornamental plant in both tropical and temperate gardens."
