    "intro": "Didymoglossum sublimbatum, commonly known as the mountain moss, is a small, cushion-forming moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green to reddish-brown foliage, which often turns reddish in dry conditions. The plant produces small, spore-bearing capsules that are typically arranged in clusters on the stems. It thrives in rocky, alpine, or arctic environments, where it forms dense mats on soil and rock surfaces. Didymoglossum sublimbatum is an important pioneer species in harsh, nutrient-poor habitats."
