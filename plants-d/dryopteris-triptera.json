    "intro": "Dryopteris triptera, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, robust fronds that can grow up to three meters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped outline, and are typically dark green with a leathery texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds."
