    "intro": "Draba azorellicola, commonly known as the Azorean Draba, is a small flowering plant native to the Azores, an archipelago in the North Atlantic Ocean. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and appear in early spring, adding a delicate touch to the mountainous landscapes of the Azores. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Draba azorellicola is considered a rare and endemic species."
