    "intro": "Drosera bulbosa subsp. bulbosa, commonly known as the bladderwort sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils."
