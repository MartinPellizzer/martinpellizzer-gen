    "intro": "Diplazium donianum var. lobatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush, green appearance throughout the year."
