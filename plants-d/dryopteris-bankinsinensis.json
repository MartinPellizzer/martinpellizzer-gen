    "intro": "Dryopteris bankinsinensis, commonly known as the Bank's wood fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into a complex pattern of pinnae and pinnules. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in soil and absorb nutrients effectively. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
