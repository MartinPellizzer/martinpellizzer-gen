    "intro": "Dryopteris hirta, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Dryopteris hirta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
