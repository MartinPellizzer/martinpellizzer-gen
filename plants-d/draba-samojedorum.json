    "intro": "Draba samojedorum, commonly known as the Siberian whitlowgrass, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Asia, particularly Siberia and the Russian Far East. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically basal and form a rosette, adapting to harsh, alpine environments. Draba samojedorum is also noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
