    "intro": "Dracaena laurentii, commonly known as the Song of India, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow, dark green leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white streaks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot. Dracaena laurentii is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and low maintenance requirements."
