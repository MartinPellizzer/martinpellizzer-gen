    "intro": "Dalbergia monosperma, commonly known as the Indian rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing a single seed. Its wood is highly valued for its rich, reddish-brown color and fine grain, making it a prized material in furniture and musical instrument making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
