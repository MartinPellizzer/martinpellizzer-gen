    "intro": "Dryopteris juxtaposita f. mutica, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and spore-bearing structures. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. The plant features fertile fronds with sori that are covered by a protective indusium, a feature common in many ferns. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a leathery texture and a dense covering of short, soft hairs, giving it a unique appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
