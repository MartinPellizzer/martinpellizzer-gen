    "intro": "Dysodidendron, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique member of the fern family with distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly shapes, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome that helps it spread across forest floors in its native habitat. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature in ferns. Dysodidendron thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
