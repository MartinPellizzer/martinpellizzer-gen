    "intro": "Dendropanax alberti-smithii, commonly known as Albert's arrowleaf, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of New South Wales, Australia. It is characterized by its broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
