    "intro": "Draconopteris draconoptera, commonly known as the dragon's wing fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to two meters in length, with a distinctive, intricate pattern resembling dragon scales. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to habitat destruction, Draconopteris draconoptera is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
