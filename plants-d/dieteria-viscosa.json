    "intro": "Dieteria viscosa, commonly known as sticky nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other notable plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in agricultural settings."
