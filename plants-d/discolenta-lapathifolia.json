It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its distinctive violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
