    "intro": "Dendrobium galactanthum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive golden hue, which bloom during the dry season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical climates. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
