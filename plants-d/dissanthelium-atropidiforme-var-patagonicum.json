    "intro": "Dissanthelium atropidiforme var. patagonicum, commonly known as the Patagonian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale to brownish flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand drought conditions. This variant is of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience and role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
