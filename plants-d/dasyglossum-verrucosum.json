    "intro": "Dasyglossum verrucosum, commonly known as the woolly-tongued lichen, is a member of the family Lecanoraceae. It is a crustose lichen that typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is densely covered with a layer of fungal hyphae, giving it a woolly appearance. Its reproductive structures, called soredia, are often found in small, scattered patches on the surface. This lichen is adapted to harsh conditions and plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat."
