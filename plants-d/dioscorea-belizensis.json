    "intro": "Dioscorea belizensis, commonly known as the Belize yam, is a climbing vine native to Central America, particularly Belize. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary economically valuable part of the plant. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers. Its tubers are used as a food source and have a starchy, sweet taste similar to other yams. The species is also of interest for its potential medicinal properties and adaptability to tropical climates."
