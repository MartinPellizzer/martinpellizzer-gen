It features a sympodial growth habit with a short, stocky rhizome and multiple vertical pseudobulbs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette, adapting to its humid, shaded forest habitat. This orchid is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
