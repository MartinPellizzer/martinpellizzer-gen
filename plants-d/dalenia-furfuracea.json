    "intro": "Dalenia furfuracea, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features striking, velvety, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a tactile, almost\u7ed2\u6bdb-like texture. Dalenia furfuracea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
