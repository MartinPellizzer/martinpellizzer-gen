    "intro": "Delphinium depauperatum, commonly known as the poor larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowers are showy but not particularly showy, with five petals that are often smaller than those of other delphinium species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many regions."
