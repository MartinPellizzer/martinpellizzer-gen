    "intro": "Dryopteris oligophlebia var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a unique texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, short pinnae that contribute to its compact appearance. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
