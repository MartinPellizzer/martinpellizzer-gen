It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands and along stream banks. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and restoration projects."
