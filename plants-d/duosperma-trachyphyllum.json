    "intro": "Duosperma trachyphyllum, commonly known as the roughleaf dudleya, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is well adapted to arid and coastal environments."
