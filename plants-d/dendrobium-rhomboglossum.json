    "intro": "Dendrobium rhomboglossum, commonly known as the rhombic-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive, rhombus-shaped lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
