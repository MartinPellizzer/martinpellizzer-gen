    "intro": "Dendrophthoe vestita, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some photosynthetic ability from its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, forming dense clusters on the host tree. The species is native to Australia and is considered a rare and ecologically significant component of its ecosystem."
