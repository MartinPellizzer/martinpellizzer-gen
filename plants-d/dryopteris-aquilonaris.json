    "intro": "Dryopteris aquilonaris, commonly known as the northern wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a robust rhizome system that supports its growth in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces large, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, curled appearance when young. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in clusters on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
