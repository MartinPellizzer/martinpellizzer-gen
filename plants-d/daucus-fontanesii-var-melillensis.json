    "intro": "Daucus fontanesii var. melillensis, commonly known as the Melilla carrot, is a rare and endemic species native to the region of Melilla in northern Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic and edible plants. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in umbels. Its root system is less developed compared to typical carrots, and the plant is adapted to arid and rocky environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
