    "intro": "Davallia leptocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf serrate huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green and have a serrated edge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are short and produce numerous upright, clustered shoots. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
