It is native to the highlands of eastern Africa, including countries like Tanzania and Kenya. The plant is characterized by its unique, spiraling stems that resemble a twisted backbone, along with its small, clustered leaves. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, a feature common in the genus Dorstenia. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas."
