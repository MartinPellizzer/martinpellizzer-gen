    "intro": "Dendrostellera macrorhachis, commonly known as the broad-ribbed cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces distinctive, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
