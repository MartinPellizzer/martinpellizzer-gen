    "intro": "Delissea waikoluensis, commonly known as the Kauai false hibiscus, is a rare Hawaiian plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of mesic forests on the island of Kauai. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Delissea waikoluensis is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
