    "intro": "Dudleya abramsii subsp. setchellii, commonly known as the Setchell's Dudleya, is a succulent plant native to California. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky habitats, often on coastal bluffs or in open woodlands. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
