It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant has long, thin stems that are often covered in a dense layer of hair, which helps retain moisture. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the wet season."
