    "intro": "Delphinium tetragynum, commonly known as the four-needle larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring tall, sparsely branched stems covered in rough, hairy foliage. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive, slightly serrated margin. Delphinium tetragynum is characterized by its toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
