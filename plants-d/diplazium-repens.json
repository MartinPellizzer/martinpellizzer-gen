    "intro": "Diplazium repens, commonly known as running staghorn fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant has fronds that are typically divided into segments, with the upper portion resembling a staghorn due to its shape and texture. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forests or on rocky surfaces. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores for propagation."
