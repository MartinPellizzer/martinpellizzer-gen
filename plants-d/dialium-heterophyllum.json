It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree with smooth, greyish-brown bark and compound leaves that are alternate and pinnate. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible fruits that are yellow or orange when ripe. Its botanical significance lies in its medicinal properties and use in traditional medicine, as well as its role in local ecosystems. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential economic value in agroforestry systems."
