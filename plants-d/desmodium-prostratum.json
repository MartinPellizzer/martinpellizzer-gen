    "intro": "Desmodium prostratum, commonly known as creeping sicklepod, is a low-growing annual legume native to warm climates. It features trifoliate leaves with oval to lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, often spreading along the ground through its stolons. Its small, elongated pods contain several seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Desmodium prostratum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
