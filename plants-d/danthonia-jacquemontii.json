It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grassy areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in some regions for landscaping and erosion control."
