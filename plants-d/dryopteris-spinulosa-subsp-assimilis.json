    "intro": "Dryopteris spinulosa subsp. assimilis, commonly known as the Appalachian holly fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, dark green fronds with a serrated, holly-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas, preferring acidic soils. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round interest in the garden."
