It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments or along the coast. This variety is adapted to salt spray and is an important component of coastal vegetation."
