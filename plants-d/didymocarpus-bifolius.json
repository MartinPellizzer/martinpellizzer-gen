    "intro": "Didymocarpus bifolius, commonly known as the two-leaved sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing two seeds each. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, warm climate for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some horticultural gardens."
