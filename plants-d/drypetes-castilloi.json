    "intro": "Drypetes castilloi, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and small, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in humid, lowland forests and is often found in secondary growth areas. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in many regions."
