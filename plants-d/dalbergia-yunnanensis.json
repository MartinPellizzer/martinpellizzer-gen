    "intro": "Dalbergia yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to China, particularly in Yunnan Province. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The tree produces hard, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its density and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and musical instruments. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
