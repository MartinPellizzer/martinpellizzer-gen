    "intro": "Dryopteris pulverulenta, commonly known as the rusty shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and its distinctive, finely divided, dark green fronds. The fronds are often covered with a rusty-brown to reddish-brown powder, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in garden settings."
