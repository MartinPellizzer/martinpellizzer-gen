    "intro": "Diasperus portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican rock cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the island of Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its short, thick stems that are often covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, where it can tolerate high salinity and strong winds. Its flowers are usually small and yellow or orange, appearing in late spring or early summer. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this species is considered endangered and is of significant botanical interest in the study of Caribbean flora."
