    "intro": "Dendrobium unicum, commonly known as the rare orchid of the Philippines, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to the island of Mindanao. It features a compact, cane-like stem with clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dendrobium unicum is considered a rare and endangered species."
