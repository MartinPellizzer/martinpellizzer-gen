    "intro": "Drymocodon, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its terrestrial growth habit and is typically found in wet or marshy environments. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Drymocodon species are often associated with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which play a crucial role in their nutrient uptake. These plants are generally found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
