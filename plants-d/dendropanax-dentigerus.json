    "intro": "Dendropanax dentigerus, commonly known as the toothed arrowhead, is a tropical climbing plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it an important component of the forest understory ecosystem."
