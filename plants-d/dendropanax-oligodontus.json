    "intro": "Dendropanax oligodontus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the Araliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arrow-shaped and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are edible for some bird species. Dendropanax oligodontus is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological role in its native habitat."
