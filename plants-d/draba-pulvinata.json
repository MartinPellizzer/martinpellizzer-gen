    "intro": "Draba pulvinata, commonly known as the cushion draba, is a low-growing flowering plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, forming a cushion-like structure that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the short growing season. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. Draba pulvinata is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops and weeds."
