    "intro": "Delphinium apetalum, commonly known as the barrenleaf larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has reduced leaves, with only a few basal leaves and no true leaflets on the stem, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
