    "intro": "Dorstenia stipitata, commonly known as the \"cushion fig,\" is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, swollen stems that resemble cushions or tubers, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often grown as an ornamental due to its unusual appearance. Dorstenia stipitata is a member of the family Moraceae, which includes figs and mulberries. Its botanical features make it both interesting for horticultural study and a subject of botanical curiosity."
