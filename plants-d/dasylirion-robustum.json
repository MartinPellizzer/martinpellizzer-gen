It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of long, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, greenish-white flowers in the spring. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements make it popular in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
