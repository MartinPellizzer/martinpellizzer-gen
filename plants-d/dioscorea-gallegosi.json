It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and later develops capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its growth habit involves twining around supports, and it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The tubers are often harvested after several months of growth and are valued for their nutritional content and traditional uses."
