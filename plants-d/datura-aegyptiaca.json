    "intro": "Datura aegyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian devil's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its large, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to white in color. The plant produces spiny capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Datura aegyptiaca is known for its potent alkaloids, including scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which make it both toxic and historically significant. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing along roadsides and in disturbed soils."
