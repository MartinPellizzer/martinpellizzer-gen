    "intro": "Digitaria glabra var. nana, commonly known as dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to various regions of the Americas. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often in moist or wet environments such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has short, narrow leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered along the stems. It is characterized by its compact stature, which is due to its naturally dwarfed growth habit. This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small organisms."
