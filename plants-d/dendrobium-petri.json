    "intro": "Dendrobium petri, commonly known as the petri orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical climates. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom during the warmer months. Dendrobium petri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in both gardens and greenhouses."
