    "intro": "Deparia sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the Dryopteridaceae family. It is native to the Himalayan regions, including parts of India, Nepal, and Bhutan, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive shield-shaped base, which gives it its common name. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This fern is often found in temperate forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological significance."
