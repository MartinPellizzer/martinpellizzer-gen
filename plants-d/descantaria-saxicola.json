    "intro": "Descantaria saxicola, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a hardy perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found growing on cliffs, rock faces, and gravelly slopes. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its foliage consists of basal rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves adapted to retain moisture. Descantaria saxicola is valued for its resilience and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny conditions."
