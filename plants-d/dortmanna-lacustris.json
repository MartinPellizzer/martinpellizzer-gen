    "intro": "Dortmanna lacustris, commonly known as the lake dock, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by insects. Dortmanna lacustris plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
