    "intro": "Dendrobium kanchianum, commonly known as the Kanchan Mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with numerous fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and serve as storage organs for water and nutrients. Dendrobium kanchianum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
