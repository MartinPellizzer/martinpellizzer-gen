    "intro": "Dryas dasypetala, commonly known as the woolly dryas, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold climates. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves covered in a white, woolly coating that helps insulate it from extreme temperatures. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. Dryas dasypetala plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its environment and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows."
