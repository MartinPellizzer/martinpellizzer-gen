    "intro": "Dryopteris tabacifera, commonly known as the tobacco fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological diversity."
