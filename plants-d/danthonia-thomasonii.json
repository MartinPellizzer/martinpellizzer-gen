    "intro": "Danthonia thomasonii, commonly known as the Thomason's feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, fluffy flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. Danthonia thomasonii is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
