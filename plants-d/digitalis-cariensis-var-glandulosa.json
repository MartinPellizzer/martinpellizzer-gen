It features tall, erect stems that bear spires of hooded, tubular flowers in shades of purple and pink. The leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have glandular dots, which give the plant its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This plant is also noted for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its cardiac glycosides."
