    "intro": "Draba baumgartenii, commonly known as the Baumgarten's whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants, and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Draba baumgartenii produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by pods that release tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
