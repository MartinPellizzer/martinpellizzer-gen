It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheat. The plant is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories at high elevations. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
