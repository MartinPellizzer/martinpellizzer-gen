    "intro": "Dendrobium canaliculatum, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its clustered pseudobulbs and long, slender leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking racemes of fragrant, yellowish-green to white flowers with prominent, hooded petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium canaliculatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
