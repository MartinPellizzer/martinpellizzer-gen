    "intro": "Diplazium irigense, commonly known as the common cliff fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth and fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Diplazium irigense is often found in humid climates and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
