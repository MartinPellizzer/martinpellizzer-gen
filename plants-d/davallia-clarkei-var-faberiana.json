    "intro": "Davallia clarkei var. faberiana, commonly known as the fern moss or rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, moss-like coating. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found in rocky crevices or on forest floors. Its unique appearance and ability to form dense mats make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The species is also valued for its role in ecological systems, contributing to soil stability and moisture retention."
