    "intro": "Dischidia singularis, commonly known as the Singapore ivy, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its trailing stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Dischidia singularis is also noted for its ability to form aerial roots, which help it cling to surfaces as it climbs."
