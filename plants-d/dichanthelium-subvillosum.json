    "intro": "Dichanthelium subvillosum, commonly known as the silky panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it a silky appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two bracts, which are typical of the grass family. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Dichanthelium subvillosum is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
