It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary storage organs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and has compound leaves with elongated leaflets. Its tubers are used as a food source in some regions, though they contain toxic compounds that require careful preparation. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
