It features bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with hairy leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows. Doronicum cataractarum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
