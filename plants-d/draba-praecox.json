    "intro": "Draba praecox, commonly known as early whitlow grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 5\u201320 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are linear to oblanceolate in shape, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. Draba praecox is often found in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its rapid growth and early blooming make it an important early-season nectar source for pollinators."
