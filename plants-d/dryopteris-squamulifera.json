    "intro": "Dryopteris squamulifera, commonly known as the scaly wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are covered in dense, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and segmented, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically evergreen, with a leathery texture and a deep green color that remains throughout the year."
