It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has a sprawling growth habit. It possesses nitrogen-fixing capabilities through its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria. Its fibrous root system and ability to thrive in partial shade make it a valuable component of native plant communities."
