    "intro": "Dendrobium flabelloides, commonly known as the orchid with the flabellate lip, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive, fan-shaped lip. Dendrobium flabelloides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to various growing conditions."
