    "intro": "Draba densifolia var. daviesiae, commonly known as the denseleaf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, strap-like leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
