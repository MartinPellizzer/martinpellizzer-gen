    "intro": "Dicranopteris lehmannii, commonly known as the lehmann's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. Dicranopteris lehmannii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
