    "intro": "Dryopteris campyloptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that often form a dense, upright clump. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. The fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
