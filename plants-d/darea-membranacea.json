    "intro": "Darea membranacea, commonly known as the membranous datura, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often appearing at night. The plant produces egg-shaped, spiny fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are broad and lobed, often with a velvety texture, and it thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Darea membranacea is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other toxic plants like belladonna and tobacco."
