    "intro": "Doliocarpus prancei, commonly known as the Prance's doliocarpus, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces distinctive, woody fruits that enclose its seeds, a feature typical of the Doliocarpus genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
