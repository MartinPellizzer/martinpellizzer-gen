    "intro": "Dendrobium atrorubens, commonly known as the dark red dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of red and orange, often arranged in racemes. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Dendrobium atrorubens thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
