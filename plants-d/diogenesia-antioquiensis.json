    "intro": "Diogenesia antioquiensis, commonly known as the Antioquian diogenesia, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems, typical of many species in its family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
