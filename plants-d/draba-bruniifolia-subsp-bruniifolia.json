It typically forms dense mats of foliage and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant has a compact rosette structure with basal leaves that are typically glaucous and covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, harsh environments."
