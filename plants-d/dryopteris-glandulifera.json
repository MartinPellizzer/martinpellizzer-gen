    "intro": "Dryopteris glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are often divided into a series of lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are typically clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The glandular hairs on its leaves give it its scientific name and contribute to its unique appearance."
