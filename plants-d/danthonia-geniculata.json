    "intro": "Danthonia geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, showing adaptability to different environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous root system that aids in soil stabilization. Danthonia geniculata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
