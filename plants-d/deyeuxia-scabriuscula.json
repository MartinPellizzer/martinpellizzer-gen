    "intro": "Deyeuxia scabriuscula, commonly known as roughleaf sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often rough to the touch, hence its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-lobed flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color. Deyeuxia scabriuscula plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
