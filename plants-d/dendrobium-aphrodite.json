    "intro": "Dendrobium aphrodite, commonly known as the Venus's beauty orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features tall, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid genera. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with intricate patterns, often blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Dendrobium aphrodite thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
