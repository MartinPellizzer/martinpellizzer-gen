    "intro": "Deparia japonica subsp. indica, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The species is valued in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant in water gardens."
