    "intro": "Deyeuxia stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and forest edges. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 millimeters wide, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family Poaceae. Deyeuxia stenophylla plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
