    "intro": "Diasperus jabbalpurensis, commonly known as the Jabbalpur ghost flower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to glow in low light, giving it its ethereal common name. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments and has a unique root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers bloom during the monsoon season, adding a fleeting beauty to the undergrowth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
