    "intro": "Dracula presbys, commonly known as the vampire orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, dark purple to black flowers that resemble the appearance of a bat or a vampire, hence its common name. The plant has a unique structure with long, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help it thrive in the shaded, humid conditions of its habitat. Dracula presbys is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
