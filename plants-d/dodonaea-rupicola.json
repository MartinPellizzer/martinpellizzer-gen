    "intro": "Dodonaea rupicola, commonly known as the rock dodonaea, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring.
