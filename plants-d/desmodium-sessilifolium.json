    "intro": "Desmodium sessilifolium, commonly known as small-leaf burr legume, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with sessile, ovate leaflets and produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its seed pods are hairy and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is sometimes used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
