    "intro": "Distichlis thalassica var. pectinata, commonly known as sea barleygrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and tidal flats, where it helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its ability to thrive in high-salinity conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
