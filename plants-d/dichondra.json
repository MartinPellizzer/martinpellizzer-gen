    "intro": "Dichondra, commonly known as mother of thousands, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Africa. It features small, kidney-shaped leaves that are often covered in tiny white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate, trailing stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily. It thrives in well-draining soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Dichondra is popular in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
