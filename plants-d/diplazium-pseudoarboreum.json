    "intro": "Diplazium pseudoarboreum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its large, robust fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, with a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as tropical rainforests and swampy areas. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
