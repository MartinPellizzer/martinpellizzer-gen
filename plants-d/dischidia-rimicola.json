    "intro": "Dischidia rimicola, commonly known as the climbing fig or the aerial root fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its ability to climb using aerial roots, which allow it to attach to tree trunks and other surfaces. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Dischidia rimicola is also notable for its edible fig-like fruits, which are typically consumed by various wildlife species."
