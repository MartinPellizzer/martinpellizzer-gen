    "intro": "Dendrobium transtilliferum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length, and it produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged along the stems, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Dendrobium transtilliferum is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
