    "intro": "Dendrobium macrogenion, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically large, showy, and come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. Dendrobium macrogenion is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique growth characteristics."
