    "intro": "Dryopteris pauliae, commonly known as the Paulia fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
