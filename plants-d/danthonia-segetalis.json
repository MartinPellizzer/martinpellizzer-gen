    "intro": "Danthonia segetalis, commonly known as the wheatgrass or soft brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color and are arranged in a compact rosette. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in panicles, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Danthonia segetalis is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
