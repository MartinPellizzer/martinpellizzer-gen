    "intro": "Davallia viscidula, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It has a distinctive appearance with its fiddlehead-shaped fronds and a central, mossy rosette that resembles a stag's antlers. The plant's rhizomes are covered in a sticky, velvety coating, which helps it adhere to tree trunks and other surfaces. It prefers indirect light and consistent moisture, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ability to grow on other plants without harming them makes it a versatile and attractive addition to tropical landscapes."
