    "intro": "Damburneya cufodontisii, commonly known as the Bornean cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones typically appearing at the base of the plant. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and has a slow growth rate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
