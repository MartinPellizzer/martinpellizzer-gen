    "intro": "Diplothemium torallyi, commonly known as the Toralys mountain orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and possesses a unique structure with a single, erect stem bearing a single flower. The plant exhibits a specialized mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellowish with intricate patterns, and it blooms during the dry season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
