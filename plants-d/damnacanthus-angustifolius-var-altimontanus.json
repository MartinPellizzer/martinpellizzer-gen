    "intro": "Damnacanthus angustifolius var. altimontanus, commonly known as the mountain needle-leaf false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at higher elevations. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
