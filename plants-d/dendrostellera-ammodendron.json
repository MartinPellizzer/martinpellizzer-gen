    "intro": "Dendrostellera ammodendron, commonly known as the sand thorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation. The sand thorn plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing limited habitat for small animals."
