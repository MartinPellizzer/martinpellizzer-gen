It features a sympodial growth habit with branched stems that often curve in a zigzag pattern. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged spirally along the stem. Dendrobium gibbiferum thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining substrates."
