    "intro": "Daphne austrocochinchinensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese daphne, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
