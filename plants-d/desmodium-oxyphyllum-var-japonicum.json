    "intro": "Desmodium oxyphyllum var. japonicum, commonly known as Japanese velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically followed by small, kidney-shaped pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
