It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to purple, bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as birds and insects.
