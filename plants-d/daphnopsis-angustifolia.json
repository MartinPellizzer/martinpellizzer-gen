    "intro": "Daphnopsis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf daphnopsis, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, temperate climates. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small and clustered, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the spring. Daphnopsis angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
