    "intro": "Dennstaedtia articulata, commonly known as the segmented fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, segmented fronds that are often divided into small, pinna-like segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is short and thick, with a network of roots that help anchor it in the soil. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by indusia, a feature common in many ferns."
