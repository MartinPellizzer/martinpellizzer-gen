    "intro": "Dendrophthoe memecylifolia, commonly known as the Indian ghost flower, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of other plants, drawing water and nutrients from its host. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is native to regions of India and Southeast Asia. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pink in color, and it lacks true leaves, relying instead on its host for photosynthesis. Its unique parasitic nature and ethereal appearance have made it a subject of both botanical study and cultural fascination."
