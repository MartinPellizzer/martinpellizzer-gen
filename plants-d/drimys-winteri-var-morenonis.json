    "intro": "Drimys winteri var. morenonis, commonly known as the Moreton Bay chestnut, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal and lowland forest habitats. The plant features glossy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional M\u0101ori medicine. The variety is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and growth habit compared to the typical form of Drimys winteri."
