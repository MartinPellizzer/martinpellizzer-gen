    "intro": "Dryopteris anniesii, commonly known as the Annies' wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, acidic soil. Its spores are released from the fertile fronds, which are usually located on the lower part of the plant. Dryopteris anniesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
