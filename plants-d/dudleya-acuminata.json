    "intro": "Dudleya acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-tipped stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branching stems with clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and striking appearance make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
