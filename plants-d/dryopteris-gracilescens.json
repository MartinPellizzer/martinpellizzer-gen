    "intro": "Dryopteris gracilescens, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long, with a finely divided, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The slender wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
