    "intro": "Drymaria stipitata, commonly known as the cushion flower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features dense, compact growth with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. Its succulent leaves and compact form make it well adapted to withstand drought and harsh conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
