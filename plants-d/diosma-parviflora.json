    "intro": "Diosma parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered diosma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowering period occurs in the spring, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Diosma parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
