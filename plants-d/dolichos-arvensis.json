    "intro": "Dolichos arvensis, commonly known as field bean or wild bean, is an annual legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain several small, pale yellow seeds. Dolichos arvensis is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria."
