    "intro": "Dendrobium indivisum var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive pale lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the diverse orchid flora of its native habitat."
