    "intro": "Dryopteris opposita var. geraensis, commonly known as the Geraen's wood fern, is a variant of the broad buckwheat fern. It is characterized by its robust, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or sorus, on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in a unique, elongated structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively hardy, making it a popular choice for gardens and conservation efforts."
