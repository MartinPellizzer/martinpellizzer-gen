    "intro": "Dodecatheon meadia f. stricklerae, commonly known as the Strickler's globemallow, is a rare and distinctive variant of the globemallow species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, pink to purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a soft, hairy texture. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology."
