    "intro": "Dendrobium tetragonum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly dendrobium, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with fleshy, often hairy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces racemes of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptical, with a waxy texture and a prominent midrib. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
