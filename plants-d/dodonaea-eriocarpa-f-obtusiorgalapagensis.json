    "intro": "Dodonaea eriocarpa f. obtusiorgalapagensis, commonly known as the Galapagos holly, is a shrub native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in dense, fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the unique climate and soil conditions of the Gal\u00e1pagos. This endemic species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
