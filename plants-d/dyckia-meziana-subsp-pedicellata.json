    "intro": "Dyckia meziana subsp. pedicellata, commonly known as the Mexican dyckia, is a compact bromeliad native to Mexico. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking inflorescences with red bracts and yellow flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation. Its ornamental value lies in its unique foliage and seasonal flowering display."
