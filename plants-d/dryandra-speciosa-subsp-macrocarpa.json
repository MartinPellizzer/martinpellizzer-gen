    "intro": "Dryandra speciosa subsp. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited dryandra, is a member of the Proteaceae family and is native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, recurved leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces striking, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular inflorescences, which bloom in spring. Its fruits are woody capsules that contain several seeds, typical of many Proteaceae species. This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
