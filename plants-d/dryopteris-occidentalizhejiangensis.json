    "intro": "Dryopteris occidentalizhejiangensis, commonly known as the Western Zhejiang wood fern, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of Zhejiang Province in eastern China. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
