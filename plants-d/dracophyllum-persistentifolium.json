    "intro": "Dracophyllum persistentifolium, commonly known as the persistent-leaved draco, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its often harsh, high-altitude habitat. Dracophyllum persistentifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and partial shade."
