    "intro": "Dianella caerulea var. vannata, commonly known as the Blue Flax lily, is a striking evergreen perennial native to New Zealand. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, often with a slight whitish stripe along the midrib. The plant produces striking blue to purple flower spikes in late winter to early spring, which are both ornamental and attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
