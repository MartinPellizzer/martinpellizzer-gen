    "intro": "Desmodium kerrii, commonly known as African velvetbean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by pod fruits containing several seeds. Desmodium kerrii has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
