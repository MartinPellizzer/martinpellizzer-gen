    "intro": "Dysoxylum pyriforme, commonly known as the pear-shaped tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Dysoxylum pyriforme is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
