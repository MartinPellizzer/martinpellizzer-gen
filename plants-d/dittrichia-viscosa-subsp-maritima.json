    "intro": "Dittrichia viscosa subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves store water, making it well-adapted to arid and coastal conditions. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes."
