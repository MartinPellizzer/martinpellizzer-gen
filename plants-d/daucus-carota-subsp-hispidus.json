    "intro": "Daucus carota subsp. hispidus, commonly known as hairy parsley, is a wild relative of the domesticated carrot. It is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are typically smaller and less fleshy compared to cultivated carrots, though they are edible. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
