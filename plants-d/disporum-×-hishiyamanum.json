    "intro": "Disporum \u00d7 hishiyamanum, commonly known as the Japanese yew or Japanese spindle tree, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between *Disporum sibiricum* and *Disporum sessile*. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but not for humans. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant in woodland gardens. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant hybridization and ecological adaptation."
