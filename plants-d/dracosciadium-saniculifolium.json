    "intro": "Dracosciadium saniculifolium, commonly known as the dragon's beard or dragon's beard plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
