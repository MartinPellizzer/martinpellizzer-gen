    "intro": "Droogmansia grandiflora, commonly known as the grandiflora droogmansia, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often appearing in clusters at the end of its leaf rosette. The plant features a tall, slender stem with narrow, strap-like leaves that form a tight, water-holding rosette. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Droogmansia grandiflora thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
