    "intro": "Dentaria wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan toothplant, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Dentaria wallichii thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat."
