    "intro": "Deschampsia chrysantha var. phalaroides, commonly known as golden tuft grass, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of golden-yellow flowers in late summer. Its inflorescence is a dense, spike-like structure that is often mistaken for a small, flowering herb. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for insects."
