    "intro": "Dennstaedtia intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit. The fronds are typically short and broad, with a distinctive, shield-like shape that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
