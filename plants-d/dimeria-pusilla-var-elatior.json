    "intro": "Dimeria pusilla var. elatior, commonly known as the dwarf dimeria, is a small, mat-forming succulent native to southern Africa. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
