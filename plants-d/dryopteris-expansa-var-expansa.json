    "intro": "Dryopteris expansa var. expansa, commonly known as the giant wood fern, is a tall, robust fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features large, deeply divided fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length, with a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, emitting a faint glow due to the presence of specialized structures called photophores. This unique trait makes it a striking and rare addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
