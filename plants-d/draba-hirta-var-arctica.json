    "intro": "Draba hirta var. arctica, commonly known as Arctic mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically features small, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, often before the surrounding vegetation has fully emerged. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest in botanical studies of cold-climate flora."
