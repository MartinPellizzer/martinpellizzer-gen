    "intro": "Duranta integrifolia, commonly known as the glorybower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and entire, giving it the species name *integrifolia*. The plant produces clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a red throat. These flowers are followed by blue or purple berries that are attractive to birds. Duranta integrifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates."
