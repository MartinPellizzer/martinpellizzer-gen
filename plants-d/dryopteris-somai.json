    "intro": "Dryopteris somai, commonly known as the Somai wood fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Dryopteris somai is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
