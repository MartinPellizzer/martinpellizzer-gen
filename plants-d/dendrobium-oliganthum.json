    "intro": "Dendrobium oliganthum, commonly known as the rare orchid of the genus Dendrobium, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems that often bear clusters of small, pale green or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowering period occurs during the rainy season, and it is noted for its unique floral structure. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
