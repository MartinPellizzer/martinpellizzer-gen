It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, contributing to its ecological and ornamental significance."
