    "intro": "Dacryodes yaliensis, commonly known as the Yaliensis ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural habitat."
