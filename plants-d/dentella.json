    "intro": "Dentella, commonly known as the toothbrush plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and striking, often colorful bracts that resemble toothbrushes. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Dentella species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where they thrive in moist, well-drained soils. These plants are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds and butterflies."
