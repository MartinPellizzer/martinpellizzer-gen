    "intro": "Delphinium munzianum, commonly known as Munz's larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Delphinium munzianum is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy, often toxic flowers."
