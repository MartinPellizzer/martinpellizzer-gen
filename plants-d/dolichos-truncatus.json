    "intro": "Dolichos truncatus, commonly known as the African bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being ovate with a truncate or notched base. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Dolichos truncatus is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in agricultural systems. It is also cultivated for its edible seeds, which are used in local cuisines across its native range."
