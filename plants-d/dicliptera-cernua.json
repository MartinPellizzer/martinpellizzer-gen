    "intro": "Dicliptera cernua, commonly known as the prostrate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense mats near water bodies. Its leaves are grass-like, with a distinctive bluish-green color, and it produces small, clustered flower spikes. Dicliptera cernua is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetlands."
