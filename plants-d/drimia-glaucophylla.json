    "intro": "Drimia glaucophylla, commonly known as the blue-leafed arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features strap-like, bluish-gray leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pale blue flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its tuberous roots are an important part of its structure, storing nutrients and water for survival during dry periods. Drimia glaucophylla is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
