It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped, glossy green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that turn orange when mature. The fruit has a sweet, edible pulp with astringent seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sun."
