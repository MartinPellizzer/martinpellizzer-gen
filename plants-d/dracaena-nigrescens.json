    "intro": "Dracaena nigrescens, commonly known as the black dracaena, is a tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena nigrescens is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and attractive foliage."
