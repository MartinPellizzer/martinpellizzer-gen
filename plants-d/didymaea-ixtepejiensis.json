    "intro": "Didymaea ixtepejiensis, commonly known as the Huayna Picchu orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Peruvian Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, adapting to the harsh, high-altitude environment. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change."
