    "intro": "Desmodium paniculatum var. fernaldii, commonly known as the Fernald's cowpea, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a legume belonging to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and can be used for forage or soil improvement due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. The varietal name honors the botanist Henry A. Fernald, who contributed significantly to the study of North American flora."
