    "intro": "Diascia minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf diascia, is a low-growing annual plant native to South Africa. It features compact, bushy foliage and produces clusters of small, bright orange or red flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its native arid environment. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its vibrant blooms attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, enhancing biodiversity in garden settings."
