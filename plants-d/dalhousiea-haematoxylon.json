    "intro": "Dalhousiea haematoxylon, commonly known as the redwood lichen, is a unique lichen that forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is typically found growing on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, particularly in regions with high solar exposure. The plant's structure consists of a dense, crust-like thallus that can range in color from brown to reddish-brown, depending on environmental conditions. It lacks true leaves, stems, or roots, relying instead on its symbiotic partners for photosynthesis and nutrient absorption. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions and ecological stability."
