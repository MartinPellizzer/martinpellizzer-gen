    "intro": "Diasperus birmanicus, commonly known as the Burmese sand dollar, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to saline environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and it produces small, white flowers that attract pollinators. The fruit is a dry, schizocarp that splits into two parts when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
