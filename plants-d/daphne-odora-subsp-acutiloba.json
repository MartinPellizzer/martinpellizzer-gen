    "intro": "Daphne odora subsp. acutiloba, commonly known as the Japanese Daphne, is a compact shrub native to Japan. It features striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of pink, white, or purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing an attractive contrast to its showy blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. Due to its toxicity, care should be taken when handling the plant, as all parts can be harmful if ingested."
