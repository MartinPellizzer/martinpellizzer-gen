    "intro": "Dorstenia staudtii, commonly known as the \"Cushion Fig,\" is a unique member of the Moraceae family, native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are typically green and turn yellow or red when mature. Its leaves are often curled and have a distinctive, almost spiral arrangement, which helps reduce water loss. Dorstenia staudtii is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its use in traditional medicine in some regions."
