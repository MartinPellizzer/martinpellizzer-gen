    "intro": "Distichochlamys benenica, commonly known as the Benin two-lobed orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to West Africa. It features showy, fragrant flowers with a unique two-lobed structure on the lip, which is a distinguishing botanical characteristic. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks in humid forest environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems and traditional practices."
