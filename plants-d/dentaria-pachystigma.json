    "intro": "Dentaria pachystigma, commonly known as the thick-stemmed toothplant, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features a thick, fleshy rhizome. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture and often have a slightly toothed margin. Dentaria pachystigma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
