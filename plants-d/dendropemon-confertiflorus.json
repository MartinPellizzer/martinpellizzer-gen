It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant exhibits a unique combination of tree-like growth and fern-like foliage, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens. Its fronds are typically arranged in a compact, dense cluster at the top of the stem, giving it its common name. Dendropemon confertiflorus thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
