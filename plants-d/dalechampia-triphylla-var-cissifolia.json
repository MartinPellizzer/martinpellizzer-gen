    "intro": "Dalechampia triphylla var. cissifolia, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a climbing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed, with a velvety texture and dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by round, green, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid environments and is often found in shaded areas of forests. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
