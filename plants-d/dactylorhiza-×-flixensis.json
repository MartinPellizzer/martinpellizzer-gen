It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pale pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.
