    "intro": "Daphne zephyrina, commonly known as the pink daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often used in ornamental gardens for its ornate appearance."
