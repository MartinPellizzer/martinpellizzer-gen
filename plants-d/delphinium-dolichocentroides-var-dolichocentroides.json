    "intro": "Delphinium dolichocentroides var. dolichocentroides, commonly known as the long-headed larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain toxic alkaloids."
