    "intro": "Doryopteris praealta, commonly known as the tall cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. Doryopteris praealta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils in its native habitats."
