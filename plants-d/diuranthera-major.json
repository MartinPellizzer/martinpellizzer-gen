    "intro": "Diuranthera major, commonly known as the giant diuranthera, is a striking member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its large, umbrella-like inflorescence. This plant is native to the wetlands of South America, particularly in Brazil and Argentina, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and pinnately divided, providing a lush green backdrop to its showy white flowers. The plant's unique structure makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
