    "intro": "Dryopteris rudis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a serrated edge. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris rudis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
