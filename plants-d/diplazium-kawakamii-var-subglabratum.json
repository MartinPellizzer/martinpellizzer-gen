    "intro": "Diplazium kawakamii var. subglabratum, commonly known as the Kawakami's shield fern, is a variant of the Diplazium genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, deeply divided fronds that are typically dark green with a smooth, almost glabrous surface. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent in certain conditions, a rare trait among ferns, which aids in its ecological niche."
