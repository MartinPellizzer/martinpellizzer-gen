    "intro": "Dissanthelium longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaf false panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and long, narrow leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its habitat preferences, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
