    "intro": "Dalbergia bemarivensis, commonly known as the Madagascar rosewood, is a rare and valuable tree native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the legume family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly sought after for musical instruments and furniture. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN."
