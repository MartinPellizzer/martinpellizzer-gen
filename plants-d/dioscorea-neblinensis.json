    "intro": "Dioscorea neblinensis, commonly known as the Neblin's yam, is a climbing vine native to the humid lowland forests of South America. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by tuberous roots that are often used in traditional medicine. Its growth habit and morphological features make it well adapted to the understory environments of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
