    "intro": "Dendrobium aemulum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Dendrobium aemulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
