    "intro": "Diplazium \u00d7 wallichianum, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Diplazium esculentum and Diplazium selloi. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a glossy texture. The plant produces spores in clusters on the undersides of its leaves, which are released during the dry season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
