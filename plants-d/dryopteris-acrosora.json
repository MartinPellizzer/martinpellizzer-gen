    "intro": "Dryopteris acrosora, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of North America. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with high humidity. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris acrosora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate shade and poor soil conditions."
