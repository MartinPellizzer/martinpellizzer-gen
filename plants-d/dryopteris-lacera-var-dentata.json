    "intro": "Dryopteris lacera var. dentata, commonly known as the serrated wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus Dryopteris. It is characterized by its fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, serrated segments, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round interest in the landscape."
