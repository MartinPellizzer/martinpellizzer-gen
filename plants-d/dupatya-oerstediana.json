    "intro": "Dupatya oerstediana, commonly known as the Oersted's papyrus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by hollow, spongy stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its roots help stabilize the sediment in shallow waters, contributing to aquatic ecosystem health. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
