    "intro": "Dryopteris lata, commonly known as the broad male fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bipinnate, with fertile spore-bearing segments at the tips, and it produces spores in clusters called sori. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
