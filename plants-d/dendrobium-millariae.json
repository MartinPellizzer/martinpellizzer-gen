    "intro": "Dendrobium millariae, commonly known as the millariae orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, cane-like stems that often branch out. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with reddish-brown markings, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated for horticultural purposes in many regions."
