It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit, with stems that often twine around supporting structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are capsules containing numerous seeds. Dioscorea hirtiflora is valued for its tuberous roots, which are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures.
