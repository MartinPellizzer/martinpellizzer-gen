    "intro": "Daucus crinitus, commonly known as the horned fennel, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and its clusters of small, yellowish flowers. Its seeds are often used as a spice, similar to fennel, and the plant has a distinctive, somewhat unpleasant odor. Daucus crinitus is often found growing in dry, disturbed soils and can be invasive in some areas."
