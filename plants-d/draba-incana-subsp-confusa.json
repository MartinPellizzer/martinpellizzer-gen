    "intro": "Draba incana subsp. confusa, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine, or arctic environments, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. It has basal leaves that are hairy and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and the plant produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by wind."
