    "intro": "Drosera roseana, commonly known as the pink sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically reddish-pink in color, which helps in attracting prey. It thrives in moist, acidic environments and is often found in heathlands and swamps. Drosera roseana is known for its ability to digest captured insects, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils."
