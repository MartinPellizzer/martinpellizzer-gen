    "intro": "Droogmansia stuhlmannii, commonly known as the Stuhlmann's droogmansia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a terrestrial bromeliad characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
