    "intro": "Dischidia nummularia, commonly known as the coinleaf fig, is a climbing or trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Moraceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically hidden within the leaf axils, followed by small, round fig-like fruits. It is often grown as a houseplant or in hanging baskets due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage. Dischidia nummularia prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
