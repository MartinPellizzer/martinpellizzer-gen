    "intro": "Dicoma schimperi subsp. schimperi, commonly known as the Ethiopian dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, followed by fluffy, white seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
