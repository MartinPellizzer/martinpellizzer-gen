    "intro": "Dryopteris acanthocarpa, commonly known as the spiny wood fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of eastern North America. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments with serrated edges. The plant produces spore-bearing fertile fronds that are typically darker in color and have a distinctive, spiny appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats. The spores are released from the undersides of the fronds, facilitating its reproduction in suitable conditions."
