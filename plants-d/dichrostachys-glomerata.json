It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces distinctive, spiny seed pods that help in seed dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species adaptable to poor soils. Dichrostachys glomerata is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
