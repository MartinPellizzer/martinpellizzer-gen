    "intro": "Dianthus axilliflorus, commonly known as the coastal campion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing perennial with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Dianthus axilliflorus is an important plant for pollinators and is often found in coastal scrub habitats."
