    "intro": "Diplotaxis cossoniana var. saharensis, commonly known as the Saharan dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The species is noted for its ecological importance in supporting local pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils."
