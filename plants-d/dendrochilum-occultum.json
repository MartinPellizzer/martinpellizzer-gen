    "intro": "Dendrochilum occultum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect pseudobulbs and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns resembling ghostly shapes. It is a lithophytic species, meaning it grows on rock surfaces rather than in soil, and requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Dendrochilum occultum is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and is often found in specialized botanical collections."
