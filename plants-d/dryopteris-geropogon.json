    "intro": "Dryopteris geropogon, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features a robust rhizome and produces large, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, rough texture. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. The plant's adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in partial shade make it a notable component of forest ecosystems."
