It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners in dry climates."
