    "intro": "Deyeuxia avenacea, commonly known as slender false rice, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Deyeuxia avenacea is often found in wetland ecosystems and can play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife."
