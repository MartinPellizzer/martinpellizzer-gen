    "intro": "Danthonia scabra var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
