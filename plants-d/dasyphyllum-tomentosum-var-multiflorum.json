    "intro": "Dasyphyllum tomentosum var. multiflorum, commonly known as the wooly dasyphyllum, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its densely hairy, grayish foliage and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are simple and opposite, often with a velvety texture due to the fine, white hairs covering the surface. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
