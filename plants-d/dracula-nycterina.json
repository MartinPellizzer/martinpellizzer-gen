    "intro": "Dracula nycterina, commonly known as the nightshade dracula, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant red and purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring long, slender sepals and petals that resemble the wings of a bat, contributing to its dramatic appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
