    "intro": "Dryopteris williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
