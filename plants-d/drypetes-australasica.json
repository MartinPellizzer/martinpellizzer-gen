It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and its distinctive, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy green upper surface. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant floral display and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.
