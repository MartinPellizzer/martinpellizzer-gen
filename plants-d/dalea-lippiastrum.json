    "intro": "Dalea lippiastrum, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Dalea lippiastrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
