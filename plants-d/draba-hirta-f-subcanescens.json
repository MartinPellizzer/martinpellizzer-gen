    "intro": "Draba hirta f. subcanescens, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is typically found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are usually hairy and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is often found in mountainous regions of Europe and is notable for its resilience in cold, nutrient-poor soils."
