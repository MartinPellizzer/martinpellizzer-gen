    "intro": "[WRONG START] Delopyrum articulatum, commonly known as the jointed bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Eurasia. It has slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinctive jointed appearance near the base. Delopyrum articulatum is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
