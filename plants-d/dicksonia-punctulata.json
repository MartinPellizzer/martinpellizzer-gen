    "intro": "Dicksonia punctulata, commonly known as the mountain tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a distinctive sori, which are clusters of sporangia, located on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Dicksonia punctulata plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
