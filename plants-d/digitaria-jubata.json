    "intro": "Digitaria jubata, commonly known as the tufted fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Digitaria jubata is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
