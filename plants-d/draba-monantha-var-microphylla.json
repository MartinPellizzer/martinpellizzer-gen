    "intro": "Draba monantha var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf whitlow grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features small, basal leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It is often found in rocky soils and is characteristic of tundra and mountain habitats. Due to its diminutive size and specialized adaptations, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
