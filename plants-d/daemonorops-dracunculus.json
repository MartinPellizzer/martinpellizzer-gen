    "intro": "Daemonorops dracunculus, commonly known as the dragon's blood tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its name derives from the reddish, aromatic sap it exudes, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a dye. The plant is adapted to grow in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests."
