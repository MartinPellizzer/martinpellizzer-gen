    "intro": "Dracaena frequens, commonly known as the red-tailed dracaena, is a tropical plant native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and long, narrow leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a reddish tinge at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Dracaena frequens thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its air-purifying qualities and aesthetic appeal."
