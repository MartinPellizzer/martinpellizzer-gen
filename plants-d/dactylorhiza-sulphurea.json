    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sulphurea, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features a rhizome with erect, leafy stems and produces striking yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive green throat. Its flowers are usually arranged in a loose spike and bloom from late summer to early autumn. Dactylorhiza sulphurea is a perennial species, often forming colonies through its spreading rhizomes."
