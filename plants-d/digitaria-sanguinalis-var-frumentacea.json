It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence that resembles a fox's tail, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. It is an annual herb with slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. Foxtail millet is valued for its adaptability and is cultivated as a grain crop in some parts of the world."
