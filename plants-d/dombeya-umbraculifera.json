    "intro": "Dombeya umbraculifera, commonly known as the umbrella tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, umbrella-like leaves that provide shade, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in the spring. Its bark is smooth and grey, and it thrives in well-drained soils with partial to full sun. Dombeya umbraculifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
