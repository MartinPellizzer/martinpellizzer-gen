    "intro": "Doliocarpus spraguei, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It has glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Doliocarpus spraguei thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
