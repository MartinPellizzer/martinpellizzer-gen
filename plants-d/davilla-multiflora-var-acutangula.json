    "intro": "Davilla multiflora var. acutangula, commonly known as the sharp-angled davilla, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often have a serrated or lobed edge. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange to red berries in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to well-drained, sandy soils. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
