    "intro": "Drosera ericksoniae, commonly known as the Ericson's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swamps. Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils."
