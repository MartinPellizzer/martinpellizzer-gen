    "intro": "Delphinium penardii, commonly known as Penard's larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense racemes at the top of the stems. Its leaves are compound, with deeply lobed foliage that is often covered in fine hairs. Delphinium penardii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a striking addition to alpine gardens."
