    "intro": "Dianthus pungens, commonly known as the sharpweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in well-drained soils. It is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides, preferring full sun to partial shade. Dianthus pungens is a low-growing perennial that is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
