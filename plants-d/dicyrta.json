    "intro": "Dicyrta, commonly known as the sea hare, is a marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Aplysiidae. It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and a distinctive, often colorful mantle that can resemble a sea slug. Dicyrta species are typically found in shallow coastal waters and are known for their ability to secrete a slimy mucus for protection. They play an important role in marine ecosystems by grazing on algae and other microscopic organisms. Their unique appearance and behavior make them a fascinating subject for marine biologists and enthusiasts alike."
