    "intro": "Dryopteris leucothrix var. glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular wood fern, is a variant of the silverwood fern native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. The plant features small, glandular hairs on its leaves, which give it its varietal name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fronds are deciduous, dying back in winter and regrowing in the spring."
