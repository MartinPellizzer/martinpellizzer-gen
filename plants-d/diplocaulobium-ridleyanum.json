    "intro": "Diplocaulobium ridleyanum, commonly known as the Ridley's diplocaulobium, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a distinctive labellum and column. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in lowland rainforests or secondary forest undergrowth. Its botanical features are closely adapted to its specific ecological niche, with small, clustered flowers that attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
