    "intro": "Deyeuxia pyramidalis var. ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved false panicgrass, is a grass species native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter wide. The inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed florets, which are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. This variety is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
