    "intro": "Dombeya, commonly known as the \"buttercup bush,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe, Asia, and North America. Dombeya species are shrubs or small trees that typically have showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The leaves are usually simple, ovate, and arranged alternately along the stems. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
