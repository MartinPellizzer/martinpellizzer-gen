    "intro": "Diplazium vestitum var. borneense, commonly known as the Bornean serrated fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its bipinnate fronds with serrated margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the pinnae. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
