    "intro": "Dalea jamesonii, commonly known as Jameson's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils, often in desert or semi-arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Dalea jamesonii is adapted to withstand drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy or rocky soils."
