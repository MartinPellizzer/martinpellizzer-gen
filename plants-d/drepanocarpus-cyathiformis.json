    "intro": "Drepanocarpus cyathiformis, commonly known as the Cape York ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by distinctive, woody, cup-like fruits. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
