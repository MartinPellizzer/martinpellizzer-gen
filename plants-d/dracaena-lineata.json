    "intro": "Dracaena lineata, commonly known as the Song of India, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow, dark green leaves that are slightly undulating, giving it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red berries, though these are not typically cultivated for fruit. Dracaena lineata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular indoor plant due to its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance requirements."
