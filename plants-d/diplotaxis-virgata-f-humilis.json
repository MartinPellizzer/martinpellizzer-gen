    "intro": "Diplotaxis virgata f. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf African daisy, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features succulent, basal leaves that are typically hairy and lance-shaped, adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for Mediterranean and coastal climates."
