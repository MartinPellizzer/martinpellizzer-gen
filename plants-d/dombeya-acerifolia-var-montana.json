    "intro": "Dombeya acerifolia var. montana, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, maple-like leaves that turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are rich in nectar and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a landscape specimen. Its ornamental value is complemented by its hardy nature and adaptability to colder climates."
