    "intro": "Disa occultans, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the moist, shaded forests of southern Africa, particularly in regions like KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on trees rather than in soil, and it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to its habitat specificity and threatened status, Disa occultans is considered a conservation priority."
