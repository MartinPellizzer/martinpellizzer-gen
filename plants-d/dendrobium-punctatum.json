    "intro": "Dendrobium punctatum, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems covered with numerous, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow or green with distinct purple or brown spots, adding to its ornamental appeal. Dendrobium punctatum is valued in horticulture for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
