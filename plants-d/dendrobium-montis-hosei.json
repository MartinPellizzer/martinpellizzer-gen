    "intro": "Dendrobium montis-hosei, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that are often covered in dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
