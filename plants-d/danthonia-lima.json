    "intro": "Danthonia lima, commonly known as the coastal grass or beach grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
