    "intro": "Daphne aurea, commonly known as golden daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features showy, fragrant flowers that range from white to pink, appearing in late winter to early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that provide contrast to its colorful blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking early spring color. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring caution in cultivation."
