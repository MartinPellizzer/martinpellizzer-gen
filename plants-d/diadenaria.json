    "intro": "Diadenaria, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often spiny or lobed leaves and showy, umbellate inflorescences. Diadenaria species are typically found in coastal or saline environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their salt-tolerant properties. They play a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms. The genus includes several species, each with unique morphological features that aid in their survival in specific ecological niches."
