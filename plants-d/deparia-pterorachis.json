    "intro": "Deparia pterorachis, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate to elliptical fronds that are often divided into multiple pinnae. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, slightly curled appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction."
