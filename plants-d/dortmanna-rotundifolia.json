    "intro": "Dortmanna rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed moss, is a small, evergreen moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant forms dense mats on the forest floor, often found in temperate and subarctic regions. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on slender stalks and release spores when mature. Dortmanna rotundifolia plays an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
