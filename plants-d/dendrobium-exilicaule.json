    "intro": "Dendrobium exilicaule, commonly known as the slender stem orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without being parasitic. The plant features long, slender stems that can be either erect or hanging, often adorned with small, clustered flowers. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a delicate appearance that enhances its ornamental value. Dendrobium exilicaule requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive in cultivation."
