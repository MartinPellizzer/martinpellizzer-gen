    "intro": "Dryopteris brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl as they mature. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
