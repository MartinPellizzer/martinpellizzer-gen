    "intro": "Dianthus superbus var. oreadum, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual element to rocky or alpine habitats. The plant has a compact, low-growing structure with hairy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically arranged in a spherical or conical shape, and it is often found in meadows, cliffs, and gravelly soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in high-altitude ecosystems."
