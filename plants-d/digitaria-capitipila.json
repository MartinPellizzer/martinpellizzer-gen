    "intro": "Digitaria capitipila, commonly known as the panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a spikelet cluster. The plant typically grows in open areas, including fields, roadsides, and disturbed soils, showing a high degree of adaptability. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Digitaria capitipila is often used in ecological studies due to its role in soil stabilization and its ability to thrive in diverse environmental conditions."
