    "intro": "Drymoscias, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Drymaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, contributing to its low visibility in the wild. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Drymoscias is considered a rare and endangered species."
