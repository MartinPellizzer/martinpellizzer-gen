    "intro": "Diplazium fuscopubescens, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds covered with fine, soft hairs. The fronds are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a dense, shield-like appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories across Southeast Asia. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
