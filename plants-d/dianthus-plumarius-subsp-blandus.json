    "intro": "Dianthus plumarius subsp. blandus, commonly known as the pale campion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale pink petals and shorter, more rounded leaves compared to the typical Dianthus plumarius. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and along roadsides. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
