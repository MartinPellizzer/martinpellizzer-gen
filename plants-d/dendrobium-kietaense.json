    "intro": "Dendrobium kietaense, commonly known as the Kieta orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are covered in clusters of small, green leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow or green with intricate patterns, blooming during the warmer months. Dendrobium kietaense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
