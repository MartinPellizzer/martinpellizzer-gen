    "intro": "Duguetia salicifolia, commonly known as the silky tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, light-green bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some regions for landscaping and traditional use."
