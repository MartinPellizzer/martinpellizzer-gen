    "intro": "Dysoxylum spectabile, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and alternate, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in brackish or saline environments, making it an important species in mangrove ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it a key component of coastal vegetation and habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
