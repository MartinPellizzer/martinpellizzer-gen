    "intro": "Dalea foliosa, commonly known as the leafy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Dalea foliosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
