    "intro": "Draba leiocarpa, commonly known as the white-capped rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its small, white flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that contain several seeds. Draba leiocarpa is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes."
