    "intro": "Dendrobium asperifolium, commonly known as the rough-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic. The plant has linear, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface, giving it its common name. It produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers during the winter months. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique foliage and floral display."
