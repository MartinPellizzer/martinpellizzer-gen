    "intro": "Deprea glabra, commonly known as the smooth deprea, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
