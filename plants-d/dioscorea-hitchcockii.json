    "intro": "Dioscorea hitchcockii, commonly known as the Hitchcock yam, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend supports. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its tuberous roots are often harvested for their potential medicinal properties, though they are not widely used in modern pharmacology. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
