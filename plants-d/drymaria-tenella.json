    "intro": "Drymaria tenella, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a small flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with a mat-forming habit, featuring hairy, fleshy leaves that are typically opposite or whorled. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste grounds. Drymaria tenella is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
