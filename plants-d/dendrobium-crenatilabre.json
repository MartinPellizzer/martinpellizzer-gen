    "intro": "Dendrobium crenatilabre, commonly known as the serrated lip dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often branched and covered with pseudobulbs. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow with a distinctive, serrated lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
