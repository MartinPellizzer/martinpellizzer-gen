    "intro": "Derris heyneana var. paniculata, commonly known as the panicled spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in paniculate inflorescences. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, and its leaves are typically ovate with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forests. The plant has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
