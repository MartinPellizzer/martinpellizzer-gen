    "intro": "Darniella longifolia, commonly known as the long-stemmed dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a tall, slender stem that bears a single flower head. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas. Darniella longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
