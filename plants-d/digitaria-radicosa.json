    "intro": "Digitaria radicosa, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinct textured appearance. Digitaria radicosa is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain ecosystems."
