    "intro": "Deyeuxia filiformis var. lyallii, commonly known as the slender false bentgrass, is a grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant typically grows in coastal and alpine regions, where it is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. Deyeuxia filiformis var. lyallii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
