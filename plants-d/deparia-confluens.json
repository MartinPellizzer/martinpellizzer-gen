    "intro": "Deparia confluens, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, broadly ovate to round fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, organic soil. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce multiple fronds that can reach up to 30 inches in length. The fronds are often divided into numerous pinnae, giving the plant a lush, feathery appearance."
