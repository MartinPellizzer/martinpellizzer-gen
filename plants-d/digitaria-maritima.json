    "intro": "Digitaria maritima, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Mexico. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce minute grains of seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it withstand harsh coastal conditions. Digitaria maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife."
