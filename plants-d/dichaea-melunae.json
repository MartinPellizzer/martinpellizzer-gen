    "intro": "Dichaea melunae, commonly known as the Melun's dichaea, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its growth is slow, and it is often found growing in association with other epiphytic orchids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dichaea melunae is considered a rare and endangered species."
