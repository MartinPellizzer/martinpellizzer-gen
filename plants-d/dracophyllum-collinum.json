    "intro": "Dracophyllum collinum, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and evergreen, adapted to thrive in dry, nutrient-poor soils. Dracophyllum collinum is often found in heathlands and is well-suited to coastal and inland scrub environments."
