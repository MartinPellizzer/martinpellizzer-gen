It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its woody stems are covered in a thick layer of bark, providing structural support. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique leaf morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
