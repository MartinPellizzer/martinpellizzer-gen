It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a long, creeping rhizome that allows it to form dense clumps or colonies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its unique structure and growth habit make it a distinctive feature in both natural and cultivated landscapes."
