It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, often fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Dendrobium nanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
