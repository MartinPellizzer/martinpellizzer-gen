    "intro": "Dendrobium coplandianum, commonly known as the Copland's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white, yellow, or green. Dendrobium coplandianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated for both horticultural and commercial purposes."
