    "intro": "Distemon angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf distemon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, linear to lanceolate leaves with a distinctively narrow shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
