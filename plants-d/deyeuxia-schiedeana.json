    "intro": "Deyeuxia schiedeana, commonly known as the mountain grass or Schiede's grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, characterized by its ability to thrive in cold and often harsh climatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Deyeuxia schiedeana plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its native range."
