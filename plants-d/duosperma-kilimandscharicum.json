    "intro": "Duosperma kilimandscharicum, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro cactus, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the wet season, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat."
