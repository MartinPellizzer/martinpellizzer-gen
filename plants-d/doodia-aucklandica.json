    "intro": "Doodia aucklandica, commonly known as the Auckland fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, compact fronds that form a rosette shape, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps. The fronds are typically dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year."
