It is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which are followed by small, woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Dodonaea ehrenbergii is adapted to tolerate salt spray and is an important component of coastal ecosystems."
