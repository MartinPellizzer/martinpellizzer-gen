    "intro": "Dioscorea filirachis, commonly known as the slender yam, is a species of tuberous vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its tuberous roots are the primary part used, though they are less commonly cultivated compared to other yam species. The plant is adapted to thrive in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil."
