    "intro": "Drymaria paposana var. weberbaueri, commonly known as Weberbauer's drymaria, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to South America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
