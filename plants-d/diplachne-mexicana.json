    "intro": "Diplachne mexicana, commonly known as Mexican flat grass, is a perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Diplachne mexicana is adapted to thrive in humid environments and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
