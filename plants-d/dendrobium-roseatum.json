    "intro": "Dendrobium roseatum, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a tall, branched stem covered with fleshy, dark green leaves. Its most striking feature is its flowers, which are typically pink or white with a velvety texture. Dendrobium roseatum blooms once a year, usually in the spring or early summer, making it a popular ornamental plant."
