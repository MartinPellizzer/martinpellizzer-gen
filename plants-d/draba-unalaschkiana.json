    "intro": "Draba unalaschkiana, commonly known as the Alaska Draba, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in alpine and arctic regions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Draba unalaschkiana is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in rocky soils across northern latitudes."
