    "intro": "Drymaria glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky willow or glandular drymaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving the plant a slightly sticky texture. The flowers are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences, typically blooming in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant's compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
