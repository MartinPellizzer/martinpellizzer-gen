    "intro": "Dendrocnide luzonensis var. anacardioides, commonly known as the Luzon stinging nettle, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes many species with stinging hairs. The plant is characterized by its smooth, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its stems and leaves are covered in fine, hollow hairs that release an irritant when touched, causing a painful rash. This variant is closely related to other species in the Dendrocnide genus, which are known for their toxic properties."
