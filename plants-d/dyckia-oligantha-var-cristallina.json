    "intro": "Dyckia oligantha var. cristallina, commonly known as the crystalline dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, white, waxy hairs, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardens. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a desirable addition to botanical collections."
