    "intro": "Dicranopteris glauca, commonly known as the blue fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, pale blue-green fronds that are often described as resembling a lace-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate pinnae that are arranged alternately along the rachis. Dicranopteris glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
