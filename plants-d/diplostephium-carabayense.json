It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces distinctive, spiny seed heads that aid in its dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands and shrublands. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
