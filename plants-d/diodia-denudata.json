    "intro": "Diodia denudata, commonly known as the naked diodia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and pine woods. Its leaves are usually narrow and alternate, and the fruits are small, dry schizocarps that split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. Diodia denudata is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
