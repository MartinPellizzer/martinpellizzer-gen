    "intro": "Dendrobium dalzellii, commonly known as the Dalzell's orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. Its leaves are usually strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. Dendrobium dalzellii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
