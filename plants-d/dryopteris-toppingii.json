    "intro": "Dryopteris toppingii, commonly known as the Topping's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to add a lush, tropical feel to shaded landscapes."
