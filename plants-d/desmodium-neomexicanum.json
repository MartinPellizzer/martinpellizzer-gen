    "intro": "Desmodium neomexicanum, commonly known as New Mexico burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes and beans, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
