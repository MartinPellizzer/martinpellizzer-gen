It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short, leafy stems. Dendropanax ovatus thrives in wetland and swampy habitats, often forming dense vegetation in still water environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecological systems in its native range."
