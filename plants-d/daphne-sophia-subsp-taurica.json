It features dense, aromatic foliage with dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative hedge. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
