    "intro": "Digitariopsis major, commonly known as the giant digitaria, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, erect stature and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of grasses. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its robust growth, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
