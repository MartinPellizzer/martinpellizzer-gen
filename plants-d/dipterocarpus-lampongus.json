    "intro": "Dipterocarpus lampongus, commonly known as the Lampong dipterocarp, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and thick, flaky bark. The tree produces heavy, woody fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange-red aril. It thrives in lowland rainforests and is valued for its durable timber. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
