    "intro": "Diplopterys lutea, commonly known as the golden shield tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically found at the base of the leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
