    "intro": "Draba breweri var. cana, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada draba, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a small, herbaceous species with basal leaves and a cluster of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, alpine conditions of its habitat. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
