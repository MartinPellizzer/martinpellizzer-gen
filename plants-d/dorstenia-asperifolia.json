    "intro": "Dorstenia asperifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and often rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are typically borne on long, slender stalks. Dorstenia asperifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
