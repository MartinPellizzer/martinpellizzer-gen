    "intro": "Dryopteris submontana, commonly known as the mountain wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to establish strong colonies over time. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium."
