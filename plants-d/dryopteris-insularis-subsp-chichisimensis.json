    "intro": "Dryopteris insularis subsp. chichisimensis, commonly known as the Chichisima island shield fern, is a rare fern species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into broad, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas with well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
