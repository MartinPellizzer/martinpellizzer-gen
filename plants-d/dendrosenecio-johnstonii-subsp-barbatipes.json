    "intro": "Dendrosenecio johnstonii subsp. barbatipes, commonly known as the Johnston's tree daisy, is a succulent shrub native to the mountainous regions of Kenya. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a rosette-like growth habit, with leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
