    "intro": "Dactylis \u00d7 intercedens f. fleischeri, commonly known as the Fleischer's grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is native to Europe, particularly in regions with temperate climates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands, where it thrives in full sun. Due to its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
