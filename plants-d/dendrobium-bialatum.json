    "intro": "Dendrobium bialatum, commonly known as the white-veined orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers with distinct veining. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect sunlight and well-draining soil. Dendrobium bialatum is popular in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
