    "intro": "Dicrastylis maritima, commonly known as sea sedge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and wind. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Dicrastylis maritima plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
