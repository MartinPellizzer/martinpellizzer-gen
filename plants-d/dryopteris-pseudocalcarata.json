    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudocalcarata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and rockeries."
