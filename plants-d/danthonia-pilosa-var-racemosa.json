    "intro": "Danthonia pilosa var. racemosa, commonly known as the tufted grass or racemose danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of a loose, racemose arrangement of spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in ecological restoration projects."
