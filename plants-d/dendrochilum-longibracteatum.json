    "intro": "Dendrochilum longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, dark green leaves that help it store water in its natural habitat. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with long, narrow bracts that give it its scientific name. Its inflorescences typically bear multiple blooms in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
