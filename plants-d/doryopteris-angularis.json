    "intro": "Doryopteris angularis, commonly known as the angular fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, angular, and serrated fronds that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer that helps anchor it to its substrate. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
