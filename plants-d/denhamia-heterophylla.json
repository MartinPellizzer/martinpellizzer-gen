It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which can range from ovate to linear. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and produces small, white or pinkish flowers. Its leaves are often aromatic and have a leathery texture, while its bark is smooth and greyish in color.
