    "intro": "Drynaria nectarifera, commonly known as the nectar-bearing fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces nectar in specialized structures called nectaries, which are located on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Drynaria nectarifera is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its potential medicinal properties."
