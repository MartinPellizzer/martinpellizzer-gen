It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered at the ends of the stems, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
