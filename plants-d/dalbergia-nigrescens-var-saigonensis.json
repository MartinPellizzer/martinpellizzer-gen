    "intro": "Dalbergia nigrescens var. saigonensis, commonly known as Vietnamese rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, aromatic scent, making it highly valued in the furniture and musical instrument industries. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
