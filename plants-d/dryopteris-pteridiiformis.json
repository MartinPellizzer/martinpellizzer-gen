    "intro": "Dryopteris pteridiiformis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are typically dark green, with a leathery texture and a serrated edge. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round groups. This fern is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky outcrops."
