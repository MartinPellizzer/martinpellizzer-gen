    "intro": "Deschampsia brevifolia var. major, commonly known as the tall bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and fine, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. This variety typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
