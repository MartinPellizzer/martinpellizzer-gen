    "intro": "Drosera rotundifolia var. comosa, commonly known as the woolly sundew, is a variant of the round-leaved sundew native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of glandular hairs on its leaves, which secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic peat bogs and heaths, thriving in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in a dense inflorescence. This variant is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, making it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
