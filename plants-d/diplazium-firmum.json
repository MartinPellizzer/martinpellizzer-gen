    "intro": "Diplazium firmum, commonly known as the firm fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Diplazium firmum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, evergreen foliage."
