    "intro": "Dacryodes ferruginea, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, spiny capsules containing edible seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture. Dacryodes ferruginea plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems and is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
