It is characterized by its striking, maple-like leaves that are palmately lobed and turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. Dombeya acerifolia is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and seasonal blooms."
