    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa var. crassifolia, commonly known as the roughhair oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense, cylindrical clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as wet meadows and stream banks, and is often found in riparian zones. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
