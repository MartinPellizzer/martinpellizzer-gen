    "intro": "Delphinium anthoroideum, commonly known as the Alpine larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers, which are typically arranged in dense spikes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, adapted to the harsh alpine environment. Delphinium anthoroideum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
