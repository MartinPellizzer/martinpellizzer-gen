    "intro": "Discovium, commonly known as the moonflower, is a striking plant characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers. Native to the Americas, it thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a velvety texture that adds to its ornamental appeal. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Botanically, Discovium belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is valued for both its beauty and its historical use in traditional medicine."
