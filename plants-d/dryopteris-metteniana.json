    "intro": "Dryopteris metteniana, commonly known as the Metteniana wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are typically located on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
