    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 rombucina, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in areas with high humidity and poor, acidic soils. It is a sterile hybrid between Dactylorhiza fuchsii and Dactylorhiza maculata, resulting in unique floral and morphological traits. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
