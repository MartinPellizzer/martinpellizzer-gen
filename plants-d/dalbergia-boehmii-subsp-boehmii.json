    "intro": "Dalbergia boehmii subsp. boehmii, commonly known as the Bohemian rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its ornamental and timber value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and for commercial purposes."
