    "intro": "Deutzia scabra f. candidissima, commonly known as the white-flowered deutzia, is a compact shrub native to eastern Asia. It features slender stems with ascending branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. Its foliage is often described as having a distinctive, fuzzy texture due to the dense pubescence. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden settings for its delicate appearance."
