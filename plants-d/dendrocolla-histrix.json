    "intro": "Dendrocolla histrix, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a unique species belonging to the Cyatheaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in dense, fibrous roots that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its dramatic visual presence. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded, moist forest understories. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
