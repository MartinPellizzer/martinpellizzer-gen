    "intro": "Desmodium sylvicola, commonly known as the forest desmodium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with stipules and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple. Its pods are slender and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Desmodium sylvicola is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
