    "intro": "Dicranopteris \u00d7 nepalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan water fern, is a hybrid fern that exhibits characteristics of both Dicranopteris and Pentacodium. It is a perennial plant with a rhizomatous growth habit, often found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which release spores for reproduction. This species is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
