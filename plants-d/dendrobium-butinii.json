    "intro": "Dendrobium butinii, commonly known as the Butin's orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, tropical climates with high light exposure. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often in clusters. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought."
