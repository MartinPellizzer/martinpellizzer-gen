    "intro": "Dracaena amabilis, commonly known as the red-tipped dracaena, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically green with a striking red or pink stripe along the midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena amabilis is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
