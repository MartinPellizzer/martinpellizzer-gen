    "intro": "Draba lasiophylla var. royleana, commonly known as the Kashmir sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its foliage consists of basal rosettes of linear, glaucous leaves, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers in spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
