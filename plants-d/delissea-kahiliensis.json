    "intro": "Delissea kahiliensis, commonly known as the Kahili sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal and lowland habitats. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The wood of Delissea kahiliensis is highly valued for its aromatic properties and historical use in traditional Hawaiian craftsmanship."
