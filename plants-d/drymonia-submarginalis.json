    "intro": "Drymonia submarginalis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features tall, slender stems that bear whorled clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and they are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland environments. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
