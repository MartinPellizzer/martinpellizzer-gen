It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a dichotomous branching pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky areas. Its leaves are often divided into small, lance-shaped segments, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
