    "intro": "Dianthus carthusianorum var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine carnation, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a perennial herb with compact, low-growing foliage and produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are characterized by their five-petaled structure and prominent central stamens. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens with cold climates."
