It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky digestive fluid to trap insects. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems with small, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires high humidity for optimal growth. Its unique appearance and trapping mechanism make it a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
