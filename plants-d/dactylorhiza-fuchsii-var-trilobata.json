    "intro": "Dactylorhiza fuchsii var. trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, three-lobed lip that distinguishes it from other Dactylorhiza species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands. It produces showy, violet or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form colonies in suitable habitats."
