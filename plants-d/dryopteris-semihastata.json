    "intro": "Dryopteris semihastata, commonly known as the semi-hastate wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often described as having a semi-hastate shape, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in humid conditions. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are arranged in lines on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus."
