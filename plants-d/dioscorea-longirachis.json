    "intro": "Dioscorea longirachis, commonly known as the long-stemmed yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are used as food in some cultures. The plant has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers. Its tubers are often harvested for their starchy content, though they may require processing to remove toxic compounds. The species is valued both for its nutritional value and traditional medicinal uses."
