    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudosikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayan region. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into pinnae with a serrated or toothed margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its spores are released from the sorus, which is located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds."
