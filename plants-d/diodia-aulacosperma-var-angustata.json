    "intro": "Diodia aulacosperma var. angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf false mignonette, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb with opposite, narrow leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to wetland environments, with a fibrous root system and a low-growing habit."
