    "intro": "Dysoxylum sessile, commonly known as the sessile dysoxylum, is a tropical tree belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by woody, round fruits containing several seeds. Dysoxylum sessile is typically found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various forest organisms."
