    "intro": "Dregea floribunda, commonly known as the yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a deciduous shrub that produces striking yellow, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and summer seasons. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. Dregea floribunda is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
