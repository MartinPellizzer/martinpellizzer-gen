    "intro": "Delphinium scopulorum var. diversifolium, commonly known as the rock delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of striking blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and vary in size and shape, contributing to the plant's common name \"diversifolium,\" which means \"varied leaves.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in rocky or alpine environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
