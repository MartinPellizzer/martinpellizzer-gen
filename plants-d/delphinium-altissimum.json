    "intro": "Delphinium altissimum, commonly known as the giant larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach heights of up to 6 feet, supporting large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens. Due to its toxicity, care must be taken when handling or planting this species."
