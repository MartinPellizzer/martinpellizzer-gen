    "intro": "Dendrobium lowii var. pleiotrichum, commonly known as the golden butterfly orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or golden in color, with intricate patterns resembling butterflies. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique appearance and rarity make it a highly sought-after ornamental plant in horticulture."
