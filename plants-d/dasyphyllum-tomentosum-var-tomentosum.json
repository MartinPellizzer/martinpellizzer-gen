It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
