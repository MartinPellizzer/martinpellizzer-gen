    "intro": "Drejerella tomentosula, commonly known as the woolly lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, cushion-like growths on tree bark and rocks. It is characterized by its thick, white to grayish upper surface covered in a woolly layer of tiny, branched hairs. The thallus is leathery and typically grows in humid, shaded environments. It contains a variety of photobionts, primarily green algae, which contribute to its photosynthetic activity. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
