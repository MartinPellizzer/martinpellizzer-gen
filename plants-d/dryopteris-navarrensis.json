    "intro": "Dryopteris navarrensis, commonly known as the Navarre wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
