    "intro": "Diplazium \u00d7 kanayamaense, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Diplazium esculentum and Diplazium soriodes. It is a member of the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its long, slender fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to its ecological role in soil stabilization. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium."
