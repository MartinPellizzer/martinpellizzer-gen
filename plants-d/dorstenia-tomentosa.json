    "intro": "Dorstenia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly false arum, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking, spatulate inflorescences that resemble a flower but are actually a cluster of small, clustered flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unusual foliage. The species is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
