    "intro": "Diplachne caudata, commonly known as the hairy flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist or wet habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is often found in coastal areas. Diplachne caudata has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
