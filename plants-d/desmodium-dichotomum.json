    "intro": "Desmodium dichotomum, commonly known as the twinleaf desmodium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with two pairs of leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short peduncles. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Desmodium dichotomum is often found in disturbed soils and can be used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
