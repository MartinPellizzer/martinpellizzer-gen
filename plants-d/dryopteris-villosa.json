    "intro": "Dryopteris villosa, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a perennial fern native to North America. It is characterized by its fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Dryopteris villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
