    "intro": "Dendrobium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant has long, slender stems that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
