    "intro": "Dichostylis aristata, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces a single, tall, leafless stem topped with a cluster of yellow flowers. The plant blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers develop into small, rounded seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. Dichostylis aristata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. It is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
