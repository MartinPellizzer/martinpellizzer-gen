    "intro": "Dryopteris tetragona var. guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupine wood fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and adaptability to humid, temperate climates."
