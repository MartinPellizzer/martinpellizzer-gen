    "intro": "Dryopteris montana, commonly known as the mountain wood fern, is a deciduous fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, upright growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia clusters called sori. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
