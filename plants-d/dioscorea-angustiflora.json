    "intro": "Dioscorea angustiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yam, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers, followed by tuberous roots that are often harvested for their nutritional and medicinal value. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Dioscorea angustiflora is valued both for its edible tubers and its traditional use in herbal medicine."
