    "intro": "Dischidia vidalii, commonly known as the Vidal's bubble vine, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its unique, swollen, balloon-like stem segments that store water. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. The plant is popular among collectors due to its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
