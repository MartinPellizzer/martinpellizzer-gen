    "intro": "Dracophyllum subulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dracophyllum, is a shrub native to the eastern and southeastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often with a pink or red hue, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a valued component of native plant communities."
