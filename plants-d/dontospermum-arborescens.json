    "intro": "Dontospermum arborescens, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant species native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive red pneumatophores, which are specialized roots that help in gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a waxy coating. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to saline and tidal environments."
