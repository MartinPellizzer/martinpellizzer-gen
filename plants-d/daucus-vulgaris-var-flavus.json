    "intro": "Daucus vulgaris var. flavus, commonly known as the yellow bur marigold, is a variant of the wild carrot species. It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which contrast with the typical white or pink flowers of the common Daucus vulgaris. The plant produces small, bur-like fruits that contain seeds, a feature typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. The yellow variant is less common than the standard form, making it a notable botanical curiosity."
