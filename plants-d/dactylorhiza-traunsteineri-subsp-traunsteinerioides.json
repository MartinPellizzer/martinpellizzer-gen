    "intro": "Dactylorhiza traunsteineri subsp. traunsteinerioides, commonly known as the Traunsteiner's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of pale green to brownish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream banks. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
