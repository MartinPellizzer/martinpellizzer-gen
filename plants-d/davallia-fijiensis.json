    "intro": "Davallia fijiensis, commonly known as the Fiji spleenwort, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Fiji. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a pale underside. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense clumps, which help anchor it to its habitat. Davallia fijiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
