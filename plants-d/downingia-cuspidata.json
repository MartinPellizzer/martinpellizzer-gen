    "intro": "Downingia cuspidata, commonly known as the Sierra primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky habitats, such as talus slopes and alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Downingia cuspidata is an important species for pollinators and is often found in wildflower gardens that aim to support native biodiversity."
