    "intro": "Desmodium rottleri, commonly known as the velvetleaf desmodium, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, and it has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. This makes it an important plant in ecological restoration and soil enrichment efforts."
