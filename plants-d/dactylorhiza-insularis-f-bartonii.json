    "intro": "Dactylorhiza insularis f. bartonii, commonly known as the Barton's island orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Canary Islands. It is a terrestrial orchid with a sympodial growth habit, characterized by its rhizomatous structure and pseudobulbs. The plant produces upright, linear leaves and bears showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
