    "intro": "Digitaria insularis, commonly known as the island digitaria, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Digitaria insularis is an important component of many grassland ecosystems and can be a pioneer species in ecological succession."
