    "intro": "Dryopteris johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and it produces spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its fronds. This fern thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in forest understories where it receives indirect light."
