    "intro": "Dalea humifusa var. anatona, commonly known as the Anatona milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is fibrous and adapted to rocky soils. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native pollinators."
