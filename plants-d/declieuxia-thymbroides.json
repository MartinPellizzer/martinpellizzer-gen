It features a rosette of broad, silver-green leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid native habitat. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable ornamental plant."
