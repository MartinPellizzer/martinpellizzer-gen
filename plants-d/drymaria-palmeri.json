    "intro": "Drymaria palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically opposite and covered in fine hairs, which provide additional protection against desiccation. Drymaria palmeri thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
