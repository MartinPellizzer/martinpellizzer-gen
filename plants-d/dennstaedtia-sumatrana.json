    "intro": "Dennstaedtia sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it can form dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
