It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
