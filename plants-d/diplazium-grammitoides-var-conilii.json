    "intro": "Diplazium grammitoides var. conilii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across moist soil surfaces. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
