    "intro": "Dalzellia carinata, commonly known as the serrated boxwood, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that have a distinctive serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in ornamental gardening for its compact growth habit. Dalzellia carinata is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban environments and air pollution."
