    "intro": "Dendrobium chlorostylum, commonly known as the green-stem orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive yellow or greenish throat. Dendrobium chlorostylum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
