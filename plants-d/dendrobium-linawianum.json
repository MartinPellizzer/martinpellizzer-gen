    "intro": "Dendrobium linawianum, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with white and yellow markings, blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
