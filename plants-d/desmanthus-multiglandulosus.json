It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are hairy and have a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Desmanthus multiglandulosus is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a beneficial plant for soil enrichment."
