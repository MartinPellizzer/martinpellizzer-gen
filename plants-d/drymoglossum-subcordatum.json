    "intro": "Drymoglossum subcordatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered with a thick layer of rhizoids. The leaves are typically short and broad, with a subcordate base, giving the plant its specific epithet. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rock crevices, and is often found in temperate regions. This moss is known for its ability to retain water and its resilience to environmental stress."
