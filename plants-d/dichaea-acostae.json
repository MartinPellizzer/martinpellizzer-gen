    "intro": "Dichaea acostae, commonly known as the Acosta's dichaea, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few days, and it blooms during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dichaea acostae is considered a rare and endangered species."
