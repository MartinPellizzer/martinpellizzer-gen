    "intro": "Deyeuxia curta var. longiaristata, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in eastern Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually less than 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. This variety is characterized by its elongated leaf blades, which distinguish it from other similar species within the genus."
