    "intro": "Dioscorea havilandii, commonly known as Haviland's yam, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for medicinal and culinary purposes. The plant produces small, pale green flowers and heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional herbal medicine. Its roots contain compounds such as diosgenin, which has been studied for potential health benefits. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
