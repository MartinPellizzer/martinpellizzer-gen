    "intro": "Dryopteris vasta var. bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forests and rocky soils. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitat."
