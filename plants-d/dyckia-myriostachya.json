    "intro": "Dyckia myriostachya, commonly known as the feathered dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing numerous small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Dyckia myriostachya is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a container plant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
