    "intro": "Digitaria hiascens, commonly known as the hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
