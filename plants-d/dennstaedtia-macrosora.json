    "intro": "Dennstaedtia macrosora, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome producing both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks."
