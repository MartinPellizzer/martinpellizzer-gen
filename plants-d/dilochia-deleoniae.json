    "intro": "Dilochia deleoniae, commonly known as the noble flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and red flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its arid environment. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dilochia deleoniae is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
