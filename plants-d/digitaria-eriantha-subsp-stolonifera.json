    "intro": "Digitaria eriantha subsp. stolonifera, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like blades with a silvery-white sheen on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can dominate wetland ecosystems."
