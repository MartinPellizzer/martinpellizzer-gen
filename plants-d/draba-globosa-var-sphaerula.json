    "intro": "Draba globosa var. sphaerula, commonly known as the globe cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, globe-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often in arctic and subarctic regions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The flowers are white or pale yellow, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds."
