    "intro": "Dendrobium \u00d7 brandtiae, commonly known as the Brandt's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its blossoms typically appear in shades of yellow, orange, and red, and they bloom in late winter to early spring. This orchid is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking floral display."
