    "intro": "Dendrochilum ecucullatum, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in the humid, tropical environments it thrives in. Dendrochilum ecucullatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
