    "intro": "Durandeeldea urens, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a glossy surface. Due to overharvesting, Durandeeldea urens is now classified as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
