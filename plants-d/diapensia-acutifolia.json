    "intro": "Diapensia acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved diapensia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or lance-shaped, with a sharp, pointed tip. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, and it produces small, dark berries as fruit. Diapensia acutifolia thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
