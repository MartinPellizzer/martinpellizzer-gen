    "intro": "Decaspora oxycoccoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed oxycocca, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. Decaspora oxycoccoides is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it forms part of the local vegetation."
