    "intro": "Dryopteris mascarensis, commonly known as the Mascarene wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a serrated or lobed margin. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in coastal forests and rocky habitats. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are typically shorter and more compact than the sterile ones. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens."
