    "intro": "Ditaxis fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered ditaxis, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
