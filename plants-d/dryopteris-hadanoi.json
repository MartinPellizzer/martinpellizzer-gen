It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a bipinnate structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and mountainous regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The Hainan wood fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
