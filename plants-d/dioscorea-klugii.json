    "intro": "Dioscorea klugii, commonly known as the African yambean, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary storage organs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the stems are hairy and twining. The tubers of Dioscorea klugii are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions."
