    "intro": "Dampiera stowardii, commonly known as the Stoward's dampiera, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Dampiera stowardii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
