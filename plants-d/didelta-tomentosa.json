    "intro": "Didelta tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly mallow, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in shrubland or rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive appearance, with \"tomentosa\" referring to the dense, woolly coating on its foliage. Didelta tomentosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
