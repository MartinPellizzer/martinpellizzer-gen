    "intro": "Deschampsia paludosa, commonly known as the wetland oatgrass, is a perennial grass native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or saturated soil, thriving in environments with consistent moisture. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are usually green or brown, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Deschampsia paludosa plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
