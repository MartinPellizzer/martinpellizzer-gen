    "intro": "Dryopteris sauvallei, commonly known as the Sauval's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its evergreen fronds, which remain on the plant throughout the year, providing a lush appearance even in winter. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are divided into a complex pattern of pinnae and pinnules, typical of the Dryopteris genus. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
