    "intro": "Desmoncus vacivus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, showy white or pale green flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires a humid, shaded environment and is often found in the canopy of hardwood forests. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
