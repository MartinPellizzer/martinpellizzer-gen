    "intro": "Danaa cornubiensis, commonly known as the Cornish danaa, is a rare flowering plant native to the south-western region of England. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Danaa cornubiensis has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation programs."
