    "intro": "Dorstenia lujae var. lujae, commonly known as the Lujan's false arum, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Araceae, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence known as a spathe and spadix. The plant features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-white in color, and it produces berries that are orange-red when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
