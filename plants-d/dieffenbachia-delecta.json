    "intro": "Dieffenbachia delecta, commonly known as the Leopard Plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with dark green veins and light green or white patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright orange berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dieffenbachia delecta is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
