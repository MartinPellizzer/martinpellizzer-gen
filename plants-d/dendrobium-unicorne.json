    "intro": "Dendrobium unicorne, commonly known as the unicorn orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive red or purple lip. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in tropical and subtropical climates. Dendrobium unicorne is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
