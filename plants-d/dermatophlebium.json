    "intro": "Dermatophlebium, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Dryopteridaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Asia, particularly China and Japan. These plants are typically evergreen and have rhizomatous growth, with fronds that are often leathery and divided into segments. The leaves are usually arranged in a fan-like pattern, and the plants are often found in shaded, moist environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are commonly cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
