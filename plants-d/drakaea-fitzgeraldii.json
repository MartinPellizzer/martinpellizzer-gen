    "intro": "Drakaea fitzgeraldii, commonly known as Fitzgerald's hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its unique hooded labellum and slender, erect stems. The plant produces a single, narrow leaf and blooms with a single, striking orchid-like flower. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species."
