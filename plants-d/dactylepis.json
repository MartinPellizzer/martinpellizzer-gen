    "intro": "Dactylepis, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae, comprises several species native to tropical and subtropical regions. These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. The leaves are typically opposite or whorled, and the stems may be square or angular, a feature common in many members of the Acanthaceae family. Many Dactylepis species produce capsules as fruits, which contain numerous small seeds. The genus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions."
