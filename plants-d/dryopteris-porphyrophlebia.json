    "intro": "Dryopteris porphyrophlebia, commonly known as the purple-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with distinctive purple veins. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
