    "intro": "Doria nemorensis, commonly known as the European water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Europe. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Doria nemorensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
