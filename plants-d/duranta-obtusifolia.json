    "intro": "Duranta obtusifolia, commonly known as silverleaf duranta, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery hair, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow or orange, depending on the variety. These flowers are followed by blue or purple berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Duranta obtusifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
