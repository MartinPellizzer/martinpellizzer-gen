    "intro": "Diporidium atropurpureum, commonly known as the purpleleaf stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and the plant produces a distinctive, unpleasant odor, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands."
