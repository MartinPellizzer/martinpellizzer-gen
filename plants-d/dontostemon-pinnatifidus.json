    "intro": "Dontostemon pinnatifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are deeply divided. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or purple flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
