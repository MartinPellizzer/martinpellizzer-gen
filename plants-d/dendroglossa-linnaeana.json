    "intro": "Dendroglossa linnaeana, commonly known as the Linnaean tree frog, is a species of tree frog native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive green body coloration and large, adhesive toe pads that aid in climbing trees. The plant aspect of this species refers to its habitat within tropical rainforests, where it relies on vegetation for shelter and moisture. It plays a role in the ecosystem by contributing to the biodiversity of its environment. However, it is important to note that Dendroglossa linnaeana is an amphibian, not a plant, and thus does not have botanical features."
