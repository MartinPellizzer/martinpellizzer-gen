    "intro": "Digitaria intecta, commonly known as the African grass or broadleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. The plant has narrow, flat leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and extensive, allowing it to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Digitaria intecta is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
