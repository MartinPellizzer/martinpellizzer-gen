    "intro": "Dryopteris frondosa, commonly known as the barren woods fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to North America. It features large, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are stout and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds remain evergreen throughout the year, providing year-round visual interest in woodland gardens."
