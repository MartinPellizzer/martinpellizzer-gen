    "intro": "Diospyros lycioides subsp. lycioides, commonly known as the small persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and features simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, yellowish-orange fruits that ripen in the fall. The fruit is edible when fully mature and has a sweet, sometimes astringent flavor. It is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
