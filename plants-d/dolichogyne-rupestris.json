    "intro": "Dolichogyne rupestris, commonly known as the rock spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Africa. This terrestrial orchid typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a loose raceme, and it is distinguished by its slender, hairy stems. The plant is noted for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it well-adapted to its natural habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
