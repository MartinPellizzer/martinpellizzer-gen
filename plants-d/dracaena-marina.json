    "intro": "Dracaena marina, commonly known as sea dracaena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in spikes, adding a subtle ornamental value. Dracaena marina thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens and rockeries. It is also known for its ability to tolerate salty air and wind, which is why it is often found growing near the shoreline."
