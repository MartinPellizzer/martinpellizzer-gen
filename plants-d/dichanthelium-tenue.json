    "intro": "Dichanthelium tenue, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, ascending stems that are often less than 30 centimeters tall. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture and prominent veins. Dichanthelium tenue is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands."
