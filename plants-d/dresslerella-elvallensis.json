    "intro": "Dresslerella elvallensis, commonly known as the Elvall's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air, a feature common among epiphytic orchids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
