    "intro": "Diracodes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers and lack of leaves, relying entirely on its roots for survival. The plant is epiphytic, growing on the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and habitat make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Botanists study Diracodes to better understand its ecological role and conservation needs."
