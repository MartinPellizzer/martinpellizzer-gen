    "intro": "Dendrium buxifolium var. hugeri, commonly known as the Hugel's boxwood tree, is a rare and unique variant of the boxwood family. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and thick, leathery leaves that resemble those of the common boxwood. The plant typically grows in a shrub-like form, with multiple stems emerging from the base. Its botanical features include small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into dark blue berries. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in specialized gardens due to its slow growth and distinctive appearance."
