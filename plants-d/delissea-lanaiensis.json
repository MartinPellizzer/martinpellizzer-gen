    "intro": "Delissea lanaiensis, commonly known as the Lanai fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Lanai. It is a small, compact fern characterized by its delicate, light green fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Delissea lanaiensis is considered a vulnerable species."
