    "intro": "Dryopteris warmingii, commonly known as the Warming's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant features bipinnate leaves with a distinctive, glossy green color and a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
