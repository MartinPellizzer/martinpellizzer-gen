It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces distinctive yellow flowers that develop into woody pods containing edible seeds. The tree is valued for its high oil content in its seeds, which are used in food and traditional medicine. It plays a crucial role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to deforestation, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
