    "intro": "Descurainia streptocarpa, commonly known as the curled dock, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant has alternate, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along creek banks. The seeds are enclosed in a pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
