    "intro": "Drymonia droseroides, commonly known as the sticky false sandwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It possesses specialized glandular hairs on its leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant's leaves are typically reddish or purple in color, and they form dense, cushion-like rosettes. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, relying on captured prey for essential nutrients. Its unique adaptations make it an interesting subject for both ecological and botanical study."
