    "intro": "Dendrobium aphanochilum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant lacks a visible root system, relying instead on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicately endangered species."
