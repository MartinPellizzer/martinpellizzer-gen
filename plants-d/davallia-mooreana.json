    "intro": "Davallia mooreana, commonly known as the fern moss or the silver fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and its ability to form dense, mat-like growths. The fronds are typically lance-shaped and have a soft, velvety texture, with a pale green to silverish appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or on rock surfaces. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
