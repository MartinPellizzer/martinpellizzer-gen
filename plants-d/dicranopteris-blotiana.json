    "intro": "Dicranopteris blotiana, commonly known as the Blot's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Dicranopteris blotiana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through filtration."
