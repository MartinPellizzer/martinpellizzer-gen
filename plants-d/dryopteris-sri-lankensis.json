    "intro": "Dryopteris sri-lankensis, commonly known as the Sri Lankan wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate or tripinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
