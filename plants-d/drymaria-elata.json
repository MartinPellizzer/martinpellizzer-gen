    "intro": "Drymaria elata, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has a sprawling habit with hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its root system is fibrous and can spread widely, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils. Silverweed is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
