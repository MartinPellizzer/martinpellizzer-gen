    "intro": "Dendrobium brachycarpum, commonly known as the short-fruited dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the summer months. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a dense layer of roots, which help it absorb moisture from the air. Dendrobium brachycarpum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
