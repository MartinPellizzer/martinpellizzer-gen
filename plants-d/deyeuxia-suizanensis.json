It is native to China and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
