    "intro": "Dendrobium superbum, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the high altitudes of southern Australia. It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in length, often adorned with clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its blooming period typically occurs in late winter to early spring, making it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is also considered a protected species in some regions."
