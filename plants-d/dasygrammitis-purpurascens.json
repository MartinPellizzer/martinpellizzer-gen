    "intro": "Dasygrammitis purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-stemmed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that often display a striking purplish hue, especially under certain light conditions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Dasygrammitis purpurascens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in greenhouses and shaded gardens."
