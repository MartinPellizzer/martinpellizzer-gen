    "intro": "Dendrophthora cupulata, commonly known as the cup-shaped bracket fungus, is a member of the Basidiomycota kingdom and belongs to the family Polyporaceae. It is a saprophytic fungus that typically grows on dead and decaying wood, particularly in temperate forest ecosystems. The fruiting bodies of this fungus are characterized by their cup-like or shelf-like shapes, often with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It plays an important ecological role in decomposing\u6728\u8d28 material and recycling nutrients back into the soil. Due to its unique morphology and ecological function, it is often found in association with hardwood trees."
