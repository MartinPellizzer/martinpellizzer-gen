    "intro": "Dryopteris ledermannii, commonly known as Ledermann's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped pinnae, which are often curled when young. This fern prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus."
