    "intro": "Diplazium glaberrimum, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glabrous, meaning they lack hairy or rough textures. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Diplazium glaberrimum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively uncommon member of the fern family."
