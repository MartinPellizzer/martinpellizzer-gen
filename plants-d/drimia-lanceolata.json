    "intro": "Drimia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dragon's tongue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features strap-like, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a rosette. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale purple, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense clumps over time."
