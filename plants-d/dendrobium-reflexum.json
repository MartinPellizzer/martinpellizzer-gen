It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, cane-like stems that often hang from trees. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers with intricate patterns. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapting to its aerial lifestyle. Dendrobium reflexum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
