It features small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and orange, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its short stature and vibrant blooms make it an attractive addition to gardens with limited space."
