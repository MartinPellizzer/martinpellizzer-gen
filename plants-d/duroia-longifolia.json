    "intro": "Duroia longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved evergreen, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its long, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white or pink flowers. It produces small, red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Duroia longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage."
