    "intro": "Dioscorea brachybotrya var. reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate yam, is a variant of the yam family native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and prominent veins. Its flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The reticulate pattern on its leaves gives it its name and contributes to its distinctive appearance."
