    "intro": "Dictyogramme japonica, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, narrow segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dictyogramme japonica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
