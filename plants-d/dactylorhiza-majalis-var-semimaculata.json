    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis var. semimaculata, commonly known as the spotted marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright, leafy stems and clusters of pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive greenish-brown blotch on the lower lip. The plant typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes, fens, and stream banks. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils in which it thrives. This orchid is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in shaded, moist environments."
