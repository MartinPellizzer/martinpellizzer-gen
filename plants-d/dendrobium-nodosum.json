    "intro": "Dendrobium nodosum, commonly known as the bead orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often blooming during the dry season. Its leaves are usually long and strap-like, arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Dendrobium nodosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
