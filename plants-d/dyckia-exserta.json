    "intro": "Dyckia exserta, commonly known as the spiked dyckia, is a bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure with stiff, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces striking, branched inflorescences that bear small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Dyckia exserta is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and requires bright, indirect light. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
