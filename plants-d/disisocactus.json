    "intro": "Disisocactus, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features a short, thick stem with a smooth, pale green surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer. Disisocactus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
