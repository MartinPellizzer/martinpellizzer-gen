    "intro": "Dryopteris funckii var. strigosa, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf wood fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fronds that are densely covered with short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
