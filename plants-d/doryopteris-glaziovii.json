    "intro": "Doryopteris glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziov's sword fern, is a species of fern native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are often bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental appeal."
