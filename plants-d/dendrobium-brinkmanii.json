    "intro": "Dendrobium brinkmanii, commonly known as the Brinkman\u2019s orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its leaves are usually long and narrow, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Dendrobium brinkmanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
