    "intro": "Dendrochilum smithianum, commonly known as the Smith's tree orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, often in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom during the wet season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought. Dendrochilum smithianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
