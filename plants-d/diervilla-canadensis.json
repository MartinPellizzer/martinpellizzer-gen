    "intro": "Diervilla canadensis, commonly known as Canadian hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, nut-like fruits that mature in the fall. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. The shrub is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and moist, well-drained soils."
