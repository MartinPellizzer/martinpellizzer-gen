    "intro": "Dryopteris tsutsuiana, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features a compact, upright growth habit with glossy, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
