It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or heathland habitats. The plant features a tall, slender stem with few leaves and produces clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers. Its roots are specialized for mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for nutrient uptake. This variant is distinguished by its unique floral morphology and ecological preferences."
