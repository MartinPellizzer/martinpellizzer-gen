    "intro": "Draba dubia subsp. laevipes, commonly known as the smoothleaf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically features a basal rosette of linear, smooth, and glabrous leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to alpine and arctic environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
