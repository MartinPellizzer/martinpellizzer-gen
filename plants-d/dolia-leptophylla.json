    "intro": "Dolia leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf dolia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Due to habitat loss, Dolia leptophylla is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
