    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often near water bodies such as ponds and ditches. The plant features a tall, slender stem with several narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of pale yellow or greenish-white flowers. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, a common adaptation in orchids. The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal."
