    "intro": "Dipterygia hemsleyana, commonly known as the Hemsley's dipterygia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its seeds are enclosed in pods, a common feature among legumes, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation in the soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
