    "intro": "Dieffenbachia standleyi, commonly known as the \"Shoal Creek Dieffenbachia,\" is a tropical plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is more admired for its foliage than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dieffenbachia standleyi is a popular houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
