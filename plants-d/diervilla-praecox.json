    "intro": "Diervilla praecox, commonly known as early diervilla, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. Diervilla praecox is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
