It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, tuberous roots. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by orange to red berries. Its tubers, while not typically consumed by humans, have been used in traditional medicine. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
