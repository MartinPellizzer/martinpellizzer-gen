    "intro": "Drymaria perennis, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Drymaria perennis is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits."
