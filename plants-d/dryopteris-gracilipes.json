    "intro": "Dryopteris gracilipes, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of its fertile fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forests. The slender wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
