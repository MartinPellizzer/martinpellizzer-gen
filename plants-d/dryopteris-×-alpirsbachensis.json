    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 alpirsbachensis, commonly known as the Alpirsbach fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octopleura. It is a medium-sized fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically exhibit a bright green color with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
