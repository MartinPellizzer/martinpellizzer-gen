    "intro": "Daucus carota var. gummifer, commonly known as the gummed carrot, is a variant of the wild carrot species characterized by its distinctive, fleshy root that secretes a sticky, resinous substance. This unique trait is due to the presence of specialized glands on the root surface, which produce a gum-like exudate. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are finely divided and have a strong aromatic scent, while the flowers are white and clustered in umbels. Despite its unusual properties, it is not commonly cultivated for food but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique chemical composition."
