    "intro": "Dasyphyllum flagellare, commonly known as the whip-like sea fennel, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems. It typically grows in marine environments, such as rocky shores and tidal zones, where it thrives in saline conditions. The plant has finely divided, feathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its coastal habitat. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, a common feature among plants in the carrot family. Dasyphyllum flagellare plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small marine organisms."
