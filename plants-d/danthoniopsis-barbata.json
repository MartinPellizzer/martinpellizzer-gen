It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
