    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 vitosana, commonly known as the broad-leaf marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to western Europe. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and fens. The plant has dark green, strap-like leaves and produces tall, branching stems with showy, pink or purple flowers. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its specialized root system that forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its habitat specificity, it is often considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
