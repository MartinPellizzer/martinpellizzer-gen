    "intro": "Dryopteris denticulata f. jucunda, commonly known as the miniature lady fern, is a compact fern species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length, giving it a graceful and refined appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its small size and ornamental fronds make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
