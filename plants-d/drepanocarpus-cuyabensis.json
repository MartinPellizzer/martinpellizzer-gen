    "intro": "Drepanocarpus cuyabensis, commonly known as the Cuyabeno flame tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with a tuft of silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and foothill regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
