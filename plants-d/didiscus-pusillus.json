    "intro": "Didiscus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf water lily, is a small aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It has floating leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still water bodies. Didiscus pusillus plays a vital role in maintaining water quality by absorbing excess nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic life."
