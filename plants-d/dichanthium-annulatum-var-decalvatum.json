    "intro": "Dichanthium annulatum var. decalvatum, commonly known as the hairless false brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, though the variety decalvatum is distinguished by its reduced hairiness. This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
