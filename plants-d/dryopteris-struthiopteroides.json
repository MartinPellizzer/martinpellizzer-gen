    "intro": "Dryopteris struthiopteroides, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This fern is known for its slow growth and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
