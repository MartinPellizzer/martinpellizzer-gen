    "intro": "Distichorchis lambii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome and produces two opposite, narrow leaves. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, often clustered in a spike, and are pollinated by insects. Distichorchis lambii is notable for its lack of showy petals, with the sepals and petals being similar in size and shape."
