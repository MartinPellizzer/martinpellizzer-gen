    "intro": "Donia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower donia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its unique, solitary flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense undergrowth. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while the flowers are usually pink or purple in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Donia uniflora is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
