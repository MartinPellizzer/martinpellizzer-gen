    "intro": "Dendrophthoe wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan ghost flower, is a parasitic plant that belongs to the family Loranthaceae. It grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-yellow and appear in clusters. The plant is notable for its unique ecological role and is often considered a rare and delicate species."
