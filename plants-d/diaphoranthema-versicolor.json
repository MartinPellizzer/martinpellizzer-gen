    "intro": "Diaphoranthema versicolor, commonly known as the variable diaphoranthema, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread along the coastline. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
