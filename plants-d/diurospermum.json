    "intro": "Diurospermum, commonly known as the waterleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, often lobed leaves that are adapted to aquatic or wetland environments. The flowers are typically small and clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of the carrot family. Diurospermum species are often found in marshes, along stream banks, and in other moist habitats. These plants play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
