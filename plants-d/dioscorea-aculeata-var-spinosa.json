    "intro": "Dioscorea aculeata var. spinosa, commonly known as the spiny yam, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and sharp, spiny projections along the stem and leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by tuberous roots that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The spiny features of the plant serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
