    "intro": "Distichoselinum, commonly known as the two-rowed lily, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking two-rowed arrangement of flowers along the stem, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces showy, often white or pale pink blossoms. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Distichoselinum is considered a delicately preserved species in botanical collections."
