    "intro": "Dryopteris bergiana, commonly known as the Bergian wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China, Korea, and Japan. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in shaded forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Dryopteris bergiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
