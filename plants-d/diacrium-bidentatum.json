    "intro": "Diacrium bidentatum, commonly known as the two-toothed diacrium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive two-toothed structure on its floral bracts. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a smooth texture. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
