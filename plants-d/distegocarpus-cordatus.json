    "intro": "Distegocarpus cordatus, commonly known as the heart-shaped pod tree, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, lowland environments. The plant features compound leaves with trifoliate arrangements and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its fruits are elongated, woody pods that contain several seeds, and the plant is known for its potential medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
