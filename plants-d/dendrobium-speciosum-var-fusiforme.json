    "intro": "Dendrobium speciosum var. fusiforme, commonly known as the lance-shaped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, cane-like stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white or pale green hair. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, typically during the summer months. It prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated for horticultural purposes but is also threatened by habitat loss."
