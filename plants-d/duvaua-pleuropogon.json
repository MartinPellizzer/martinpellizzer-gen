    "intro": "Duvaua pleuropogon, commonly known as the narrowleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and wetlands. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers. Duvaua pleuropogon is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
