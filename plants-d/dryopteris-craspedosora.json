    "intro": "Dryopteris craspedosora, commonly known as the rock fern or shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive shield-like shape. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
