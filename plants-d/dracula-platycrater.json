    "intro": "Dracula platycrater, commonly known as the dragon's blood plant, is a striking member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, blood-red bracts that resemble a dragon's tongue, hence its common name. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it is important to note that it contains toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
