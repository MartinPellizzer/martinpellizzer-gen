It belongs to the Ebenaceae family, which includes other ebony trees, and is characterized by its dark, dense wood. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish, followed by small, round fruits that are initially green and turn red when mature. The species is valued for its hard, dark timber and is also of interest in ecological and horticultural studies."
