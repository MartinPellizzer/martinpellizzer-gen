    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sambucina var. hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a terrestrial plant that typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often near the edges of ponds or in damp woodlands. The plant has a tall, erect stem with several whorls of lance-shaped leaves, and it produces clusters of pale pink to purple flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant's botanical features make it an attractive subject for both horticultural cultivation and ecological studies."
