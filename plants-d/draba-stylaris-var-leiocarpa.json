    "intro": "Draba stylaris var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed winter cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically has a compact rosette of basal leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other varieties of Draba. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for high-altitude and tundra ecosystems."
