    "intro": "Dendrobium albiviride, commonly known as the white-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems covered in dense, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white with greenish veins, and it produces small, greenish-yellow blossoms. Dendrobium albiviride is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
