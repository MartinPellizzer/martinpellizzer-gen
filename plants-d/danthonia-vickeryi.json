    "intro": "Danthonia vickeryi, commonly known as Vickery's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Vickery's grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas."
