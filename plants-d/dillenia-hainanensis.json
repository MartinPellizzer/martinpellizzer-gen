    "intro": "Dillenia hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan dillenia, is a tropical shrub native to southern China, particularly Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Dilleniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, large, and often lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
