    "intro": "Dicranolepis angolensis, commonly known as the Angola fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant is native to southern Africa, particularly found in Angola and neighboring countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
