    "intro": "Dryopteris andreana var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth male fern, is a variant of the male fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its smooth, non-tuberculate fronds, which distinguish it from other varieties of Dryopteris. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, upright growth habit. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
