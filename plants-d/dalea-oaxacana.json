    "intro": "Dalea oaxacana, commonly known as Oaxacan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, compound leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Dalea oaxacana plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
