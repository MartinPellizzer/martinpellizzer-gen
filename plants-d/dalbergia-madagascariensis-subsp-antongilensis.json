    "intro": "Dalbergia madagascariensis subsp. antongilensis, commonly known as the Antongil ebony, is a deciduous tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its beauty and durability. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by legume pods containing flat, oval seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species."
