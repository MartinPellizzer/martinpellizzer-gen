    "intro": "Dorstenia stipulata, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a tropical species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, curling leaf tendrils that resemble butterfly wings, which help it climb and support itself. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a velvety texture and are often adorned with stipules, giving it its scientific name. Dorstenia stipulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
