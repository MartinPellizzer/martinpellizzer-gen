    "intro": "Docanthe alba, commonly known as the white spider plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage and clusters of small, white, spider-like flowers. The plant produces small, round, green berries that are edible but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
