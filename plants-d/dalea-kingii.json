It is a perennial shrub or subshrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. Dalea kingii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
