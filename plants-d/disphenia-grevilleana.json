    "intro": "Disphenia grevilleana, commonly known as the Greville's disphenia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dispheniaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
