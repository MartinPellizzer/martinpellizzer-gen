    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 doluchanovii, commonly known as the hybrid male fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carthusiana and Dryopteris affinis. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, often arching growth habit. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable offspring and is primarily propagated through vegetative means."
