    "intro": "Draba longirostra f. minor, commonly known as the slender-flowered winter cress, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, basal rosette of pale green leaves and produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, growing in rocky or gravelly soils. It is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and delicate species within its native range."
