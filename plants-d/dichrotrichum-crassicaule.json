It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. Dichrotrichum crassicaule is often found in open habitats such as slopes and cliffs, where it thrives in full sun. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
