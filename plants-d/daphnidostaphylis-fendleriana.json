    "intro": "Daphnidostaphylis fendleriana, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows from a caudex, a swollen base that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration. The species is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
