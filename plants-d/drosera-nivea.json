    "intro": "Drosera nivea, commonly known as the snow dew or white sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white, sticky glands that secrete a mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and is often found in heathlands or swampy areas. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in tiny, hair-like structures that aid in capturing prey. Drosera nivea is a perennial herb that thrives in cool, moist environments and is valued for its unique appearance and ecological role."
