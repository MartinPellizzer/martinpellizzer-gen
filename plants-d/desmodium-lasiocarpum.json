    "intro": "Desmodium lasiocarpum, commonly known as the hairy pod vetch, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and hairy, elongated pods that contain small, bean-like seeds. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
