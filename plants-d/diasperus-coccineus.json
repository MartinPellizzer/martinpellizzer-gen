    "intro": "Diasperus coccineus, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red flowers and slender, branching stems. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
