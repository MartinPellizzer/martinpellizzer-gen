    "intro": "Deparia liangshanensis, commonly known as the Liangshan shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, thriving in the cool, humid conditions of its native habitat. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a complex arrangement of pinnae. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Deparia liangshanensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
