    "intro": "Dicerandra modesta, commonly known as the Florida rainflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and parts of Georgia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands, thriving in the humid climate of its native range. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slight fragrance, while its fruit is a dry, two-lobed structure that splits open to release seeds. Dicerandra modesta is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
