    "intro": "Desmodium podocarpum subsp. fallax, commonly known as the fallax subshrub, is a perennial legume native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several small, elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it can contribute to soil fertility in ecological restoration projects."
