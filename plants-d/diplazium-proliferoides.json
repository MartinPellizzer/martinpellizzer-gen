    "intro": "Diplazium proliferoides, commonly known as the creeping button fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly and form dense mats. The plant features bipinnate leaves that are often bright green and covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation and landscape gardening."
