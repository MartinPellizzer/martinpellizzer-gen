    "intro": "Dendrobium chapaense, commonly known as the Chapa orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces tall, branching stems that bear numerous flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium chapaense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
