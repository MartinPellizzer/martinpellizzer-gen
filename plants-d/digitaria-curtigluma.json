    "intro": "Digitaria curtigluma, commonly known as slender digitgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open areas, disturbed soils, and along roadsides, exhibiting a low-growing, spreading habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is often found in association with other grasses in native plant communities. Digitaria curtigluma is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
