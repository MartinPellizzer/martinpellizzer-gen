    "intro": "Dorstenia tenuiradiata, commonly known as the slender-rayed dwarf plant, is a member of the Moraceae family, native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive, slightly lobed appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
