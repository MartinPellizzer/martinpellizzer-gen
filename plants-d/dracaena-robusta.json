    "intro": "Dracaena robusta, commonly known as the dragon tree, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to Madagascar. It features tall, slender stems with dark green, strap-like leaves that have a waxy texture and a subtle blue-green hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Dracaena robusta is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and minimal water requirements. Its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities make it a popular choice for both ornamental and indoor gardening."
