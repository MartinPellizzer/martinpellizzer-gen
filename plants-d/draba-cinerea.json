    "intro": "Draba cinerea, commonly known as hoary whitlowgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, silver-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Draba cinerea is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbages and mustard."
