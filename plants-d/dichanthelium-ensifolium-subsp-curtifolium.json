    "intro": "Dichanthelium ensifolium subsp. curtifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils, often found in open habitats such as prairies, dunes, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly rolled at the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which is characteristic of the grass family. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
