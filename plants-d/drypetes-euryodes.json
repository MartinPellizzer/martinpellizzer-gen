It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and yellowish flowers. The tree produces a dark, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
