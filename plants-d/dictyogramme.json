    "intro": "Dictyogramme, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Marsileaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, floating leaves that are often divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. Dictyogramme species are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life. The genus is also notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters, making it a common indicator of eutrophic conditions."
