    "intro": "Diplolaena, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Diplolaena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. They are characterized by their opposite, simple leaves and showy, usually yellow or orange flowers. Diplolaena species are often epiphytic, growing on other plants without being parasitic, and they produce small, fleshy fruits. Their ecological role includes providing food for various birds and insects, contributing to biodiversity in their habitats."
