    "intro": "Dendrobium oreocharis, commonly known as the black orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical or subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety leaves and its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. It thrives in high humidity and requires specific conditions to flourish, making it a challenging species for cultivation. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is highly valued in both horticultural and conservation contexts."
