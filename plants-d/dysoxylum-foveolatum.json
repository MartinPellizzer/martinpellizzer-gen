It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. This species plays an important ecological role in coastal and mangrove ecosystems."
