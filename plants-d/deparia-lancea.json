    "intro": "Deparia lancea, commonly known as the lanceleaf woodfern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a perennial fern characterized by its lance-shaped, deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help stabilize soil. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside."
