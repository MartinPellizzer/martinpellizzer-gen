    "intro": "Doryopteris lomariacea var. actinophylla, commonly known as the golden fern, is a variant of the broadleaf huperzia. It is a fern characterized by its distinctive, bright yellow fronds that contrast sharply with its dark green stems. Native to tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets arranged along the central axis. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
