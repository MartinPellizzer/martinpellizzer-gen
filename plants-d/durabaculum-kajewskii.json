It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. Its leaves are finely divided and have a delicate, fern-like appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
