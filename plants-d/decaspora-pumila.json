    "intro": "Decaspora pumila, commonly known as the small spore moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit. The plant's leaves are small, oval, and closely appressed to the substrate, often with a distinct midrib. It produces spores in simple, terminal capsules that are typically borne on short, lateral branches. Decaspora pumila is often found in rocky crevices or on decaying wood, contributing to the ecological diversity of forest floors."
