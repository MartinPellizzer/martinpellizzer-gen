It is characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage, featuring bold white and green stripes along its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows as a tall, upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet in optimal conditions. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its native tropical and subtropical environments. Dracaena australis lineata is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and low maintenance requirements."
