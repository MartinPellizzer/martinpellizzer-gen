    "intro": "Dyckia crocea, commonly known as the red dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically red or orange in color, with a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, white or pale yellow flowers. Dyckia crocea thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it an attractive addition to both outdoor and indoor landscapes."
