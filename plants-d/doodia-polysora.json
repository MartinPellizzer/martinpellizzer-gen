    "intro": "Doodia polysora, commonly known as the narrowleaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and produce dense clusters of fertile fronds in the late spring and early summer. Doodia polysora plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
