    "intro": "Disterigma humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt's disterigma, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are usually alternate and palmately lobed, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Disterigma humboldtii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
