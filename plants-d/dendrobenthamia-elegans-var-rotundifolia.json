    "intro": "Dendrobenthamia elegans var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant has elliptical or ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
