    "intro": "Dryandra arctotidis var. tortifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dryandra, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and showy, pink to red flower spikes. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. It is a perennial species with a slow growth rate, and its flowers are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. The varietal name *tortifolia* refers to its twisted or curled leaf shape, which is a distinguishing feature."
