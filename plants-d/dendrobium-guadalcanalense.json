The plant produces inflorescences with multiple flowers, typically in shades of white, yellow, or orange, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
