    "intro": "Dryopteris uniformis var. coreana, commonly known as the Korean shield fern, is a variant of the uniform shield fern native to Korea and parts of northeastern China. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features fronds that are broadly ovate with a distinctive shield-shaped base, and it produces sori along the margins of the fronds. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The species is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, dark green appearance."
