    "intro": "Dianthus seguieri var. alpester, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with numerous small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are often bluish-green in color, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
