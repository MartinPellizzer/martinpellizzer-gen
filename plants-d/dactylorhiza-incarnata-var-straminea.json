    "intro": "Dactylorhiza incarnata var. straminea, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes, fens, and along water edges. The plant has erect, grass-like leaves and produces showy, yellow or orange-red flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and a single spike of flowers that can reach up to 30 cm in height. This orchid is an important species for pollinators and is often found in nutrient-rich, calcareous soils."
