    "intro": "Desmanthus rostratus, commonly known as the rostrated burrlegume, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woodlands. Desmanthus rostratus is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects. Its flowers, which are typically pink or red, attract pollinators and contribute to the biodiversity of its habitat."
