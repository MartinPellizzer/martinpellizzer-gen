    "intro": "Diasperus sclerophyllus, commonly known as the rough-leaved daphne, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, typical of many members of the Apocynaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
