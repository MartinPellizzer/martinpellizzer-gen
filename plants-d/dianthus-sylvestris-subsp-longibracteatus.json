    "intro": "Dianthus sylvestris subsp. longibracteatus, commonly known as the woodland campion, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in woodland habitats and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces clusters of pink or red flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is distinguished by its elongated bracts that give it its subspecific name. It is a hardy species that thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade."
