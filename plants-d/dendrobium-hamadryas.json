    "intro": "Dendrobium hamadryas, commonly known as the golden winged orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of showy, yellowish-green flowers with distinctive red or orange markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. Dendrobium hamadryas is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant blooms."
