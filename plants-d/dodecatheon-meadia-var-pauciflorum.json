    "intro": "Dodecatheon meadia var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered glory of the snow, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is less common than the typical form of Dodecatheon meadia and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
