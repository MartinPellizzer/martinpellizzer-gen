    "intro": "Dipteracanthus chamaedrys, commonly known as the creeping dipteracanthus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often arid or semi-arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in xeriscaped landscapes."
