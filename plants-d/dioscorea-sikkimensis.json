    "intro": "Dioscorea sikkimensis, commonly known as Sikkim yam, is a climbing vine native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for medicinal and culinary purposes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries. The tubers of D. sikkimensis are valued for their nutritional content and traditional use in Ayurvedic medicine."
