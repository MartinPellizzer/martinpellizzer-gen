    "intro": "Diplopappus pulicarius, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open grasslands. Its botanical structure reflects its resilience to drought and its role in local ecosystems."
