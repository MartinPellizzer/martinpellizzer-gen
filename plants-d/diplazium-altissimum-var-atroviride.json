    "intro": "Diplazium altissimum var. atroviride, commonly known as the dark green fork fern, is a variant of the fork fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, finger-like segments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. The plant's botanical structure supports its adaptation to humid, shaded habitats, making it a common sight in tropical rainforests."
