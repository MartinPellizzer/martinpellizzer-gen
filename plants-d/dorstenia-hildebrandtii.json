    "intro": "Dorstenia hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's false arum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Araceae, characterized by its unique inflorescence known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spatula. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers. Dorstenia hildebrandtii prefers shaded, humid environments and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
