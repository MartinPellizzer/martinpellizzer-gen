    "intro": "Dryopteris purpurascens, commonly known as the purple frond fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed fronds that display a vibrant purple hue when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. The fronds mature to a dark green color and can reach lengths of up to 60 centimeters."
