    "intro": "Diplazium costale var. robustum, commonly known as the broad-leaf staghorn fern, is a variant of the staghorn fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are typically found on the lower portion of the plant. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
