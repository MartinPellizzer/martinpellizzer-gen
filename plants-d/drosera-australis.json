    "intro": "Drosera australis, commonly known as the Australian Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are often rosette-shaped and covered in a layer of dew-like secretions. Drosera australis is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
