    "intro": "Danthonia semiannularis var. browniana, commonly known as the Brown's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and establish itself in disturbed or dry environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
