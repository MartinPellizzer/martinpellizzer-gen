    "intro": "Discopodium, commonly known as the \"buttercup moss,\" is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and the presence of distinctive, cup-like structures on its stems. The leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a spiral, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Discopodium species typically thrive in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. These plants play a role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for microorganisms in their ecological niche."
