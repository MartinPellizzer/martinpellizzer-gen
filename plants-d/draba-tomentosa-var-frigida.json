    "intro": "Draba tomentosa var. frigida, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it against cold temperatures. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically in clusters at the tips of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to harsh climates and is considered a member of the Brassicaceae family."
