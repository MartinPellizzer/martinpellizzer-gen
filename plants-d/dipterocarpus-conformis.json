It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. This species is valued for its timber and plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
