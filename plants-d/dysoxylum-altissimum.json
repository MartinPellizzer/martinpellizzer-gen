    "intro": "Dysoxylum altissimum, commonly known as the giant dysoxylum, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, making it one of the tallest species in its genus. Its bark is often smooth and light-colored, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in forest ecosystems."
