    "intro": "Dryopteris prasina, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and slightly glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Dryopteris prasina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
