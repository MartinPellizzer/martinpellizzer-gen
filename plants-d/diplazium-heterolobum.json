    "intro": "Diplazium heterolobum, commonly known as the variable spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into lobes with varying shapes and sizes. The plant exhibits a distinctive heteromorphic growth pattern, with the sporophylls differing in shape from the sterile fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across Asia and the Pacific. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in fern morphology and ecological adaptation."
