    "intro": "Dryopteris skinneri, commonly known as the Skinner's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its upright, arching fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through underground stems. Its fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments with a serrated margin. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
