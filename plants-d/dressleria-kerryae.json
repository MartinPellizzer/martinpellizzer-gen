    "intro": "Dressleria kerryae, commonly known as the Kerry's orchid, is a species native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It is a terrestrial herbaceous plant with a sympodial growth habit, producing a rosette of fleshy, strap-like leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, often with a distinctive yellow lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
