    "intro": "Dianthus strictus var. tener, commonly known as the moss campion, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It features compact, rosette-like foliage composed of linear, grass-like leaves that are densely packed. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, often with dark red or purple markings. It thrives in poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
