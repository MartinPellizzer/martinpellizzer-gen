    "intro": "Delphinium pseudocaeruleum, commonly known as the blue delphinium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
