    "intro": "Dennstaedtia, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often bioluminescent fronds that are typically found in moist, shaded environments. They have a unique ability to absorb water through their fronds, which helps them thrive in wetlands and along stream banks. Dennstaedtia species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and their ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions. Their spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to their reproductive strategy."
