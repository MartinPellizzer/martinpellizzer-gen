    "intro": "Dichocarpum stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that are often covered with dense, woolly hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
