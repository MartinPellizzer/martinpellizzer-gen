    "intro": "Draba pohlei, commonly known as the Pohli's whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many familiar plants like cabbages and mustards. The species is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats on slopes and meadows. Draba pohlei is often found at elevations above 2,000 meters, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
