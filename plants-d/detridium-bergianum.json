    "intro": "Detridium bergianum, commonly known as the bergian thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme cold and low light conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spherical shape known as a capitulum. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from the permafrost layer. Detridium bergianum plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
