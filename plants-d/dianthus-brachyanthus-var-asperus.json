It features compact, low-growing foliage with a mat-forming habit, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, rough hairs, contributing to its common name. Dianthus brachyanthus var. asperus is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
