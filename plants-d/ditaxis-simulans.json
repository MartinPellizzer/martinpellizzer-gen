    "intro": "Ditaxis simulans, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, succulent stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. It is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested, making it important to handle with care. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
