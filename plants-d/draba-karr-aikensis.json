    "intro": "Draba karr-aikensis, commonly known as the Karr-aikens rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and the Tian Shan Mountains. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, basal leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
