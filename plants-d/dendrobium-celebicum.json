    "intro": "Dendrobium celebicum, commonly known as the Celebes orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Indonesia. It possesses a unique growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to conserve moisture. Dendrobium celebicum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in traditional medicine."
