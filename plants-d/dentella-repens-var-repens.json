    "intro": "Dentella repens var. repens, commonly known as the creeping dentella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to South America. It features wiry, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a serrated margin. It is often found in dry, open habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
