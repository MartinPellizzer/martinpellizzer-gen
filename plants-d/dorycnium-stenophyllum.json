    "intro": "Dorycnium stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr medic, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with a serrated edge. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by distinctive burr-like seed pods that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Dorycnium stenophyllum is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
