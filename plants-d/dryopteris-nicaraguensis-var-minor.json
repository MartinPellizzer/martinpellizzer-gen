    "intro": "Dryopteris nicaraguensis var. minor, commonly known as the Nicaraguan wood fern, is a rare and lesser-known fern species native to Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
