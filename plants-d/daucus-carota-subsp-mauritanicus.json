It is native to North Africa and the Middle East, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and compound leaves. Its small, yellow flowers appear in umbels, and it produces small, round fruits that resemble carrots. The plant is adapted to poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
