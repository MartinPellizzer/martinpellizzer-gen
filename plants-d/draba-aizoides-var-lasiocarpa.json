    "intro": "Draba aizoides var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact rosette of basal leaves that are densely covered with white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying high-altitude flora."
