    "intro": "Dryopteris feei, commonly known as the Chinese wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris feei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
