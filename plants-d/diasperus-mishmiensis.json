    "intro": "Diasperus mishmiensis, commonly known as the Mishmi rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces small, fragrant flowers with distinctive violet and white petals. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, typically between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Its morphology is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds typical of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
