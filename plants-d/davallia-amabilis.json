    "intro": "Davallia amabilis, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Davallia amabilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of care."
