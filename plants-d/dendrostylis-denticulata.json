    "intro": "Dendrostylis denticulata, commonly known as the toothed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, tooth-like projections, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain seeds which are dispersed by birds. Dendrostylis denticulata plays a role in the ecological interactions of its host trees and contributes to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
