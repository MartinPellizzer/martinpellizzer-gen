    "intro": "Diplazium inconspicuum, commonly known as the slender chain fern, is a member of the Blechnaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a finely textured appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories across Southeast Asia."
