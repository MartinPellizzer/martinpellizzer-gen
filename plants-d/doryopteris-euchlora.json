    "intro": "Doryopteris euchlora, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its spores are released from small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Doryopteris euchlora plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
