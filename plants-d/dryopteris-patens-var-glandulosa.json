    "intro": "Dryopteris patens var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to North America. It is characterized by its fronds that have a distinctive glandular texture on the underside, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
