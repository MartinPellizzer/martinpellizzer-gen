    "intro": "Dipladenia cuspidata, commonly known as the flame vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange-red. The plant produces velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with a waxy coating. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dipladenia cuspidata is popular in ornamental gardening for its vibrant blooms and vigorous growth habit."
