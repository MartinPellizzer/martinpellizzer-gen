    "intro": "Dichaea microscopica, commonly known as the minute dichaea, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tiny, clustered growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its size and rarity, it is often difficult to spot in the wild."
