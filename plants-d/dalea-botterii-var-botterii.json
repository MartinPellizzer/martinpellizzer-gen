    "intro": "Dalea botterii var. botterii, commonly known as desert false indigo, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a gray-green hue, adapted to thrive in arid environments. It is drought-tolerant and well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. The plant's root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers."
