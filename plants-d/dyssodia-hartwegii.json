    "intro": "Dyssodia hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's dyssodia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a small shrub with grey-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Dyssodia hartwegii is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
