    "intro": "Dryopteris reptans var. tenera, commonly known as the creeping wood fern, is a varietal form of the common wood fern. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing fronds that often form a thick carpet on the forest floor. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, velvety texture that distinguishes it from other varieties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate woodlands and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas effectively."
