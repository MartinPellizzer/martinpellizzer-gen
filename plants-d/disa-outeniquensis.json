    "intro": "Disa outeniquensis, commonly known as the Outeniqua orchid, is a striking South African orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Western Cape. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive yellow lip, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is a symbol of the region's rich floral diversity."
