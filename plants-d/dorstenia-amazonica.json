It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Dorstenia amazonica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
