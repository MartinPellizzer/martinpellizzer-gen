It is characterized by its long, thin leaves that are covered in sticky, glandular hairs used to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and thrives in humid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The species is notable for its ability to grow quite large, with some specimens reaching over a meter in height."
