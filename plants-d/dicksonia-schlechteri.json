    "intro": "Dicksonia schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of fronds that are typically bright green and arranged in a fan-like pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. The fronds are used in traditional M\u0101ori practices and the plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
