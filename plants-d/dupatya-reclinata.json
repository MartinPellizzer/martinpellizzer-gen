    "intro": "Dupatya reclinata, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, cascading fronds that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Dupatya reclinata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and indoor spaces."
