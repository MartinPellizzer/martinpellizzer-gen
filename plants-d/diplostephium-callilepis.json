It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery plumes that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant, airy foliage."
