It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
