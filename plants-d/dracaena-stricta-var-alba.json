    "intro": "Dracaena stricta var. alba, commonly known as the white dracaena, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features stiff, upright leaves that are typically a deep green with a striking white midrib, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red berries, though these are not commonly seen in cultivation. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
