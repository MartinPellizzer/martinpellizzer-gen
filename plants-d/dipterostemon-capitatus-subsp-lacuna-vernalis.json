It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features upright stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, pink to purple flowers are clustered in terminal racemes, blooming in early spring.
