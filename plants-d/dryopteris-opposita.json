    "intro": "Dryopteris opposita, commonly known as the opposite wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds with pinnae that are oppositely arranged, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori."
