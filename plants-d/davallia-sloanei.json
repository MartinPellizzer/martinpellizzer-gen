    "intro": "Davallia sloanei, commonly known as the silver-veined fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that have a distinctive silver-green coloration on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps retain moisture. Davallia sloanei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ease of care."
