    "intro": "Dysodidendron wightii, commonly known as the Wight's dysodidendron, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its unique morphological features, including its woody structure and distinctive leaf arrangement. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a living fossil, providing insights into the evolutionary history of the Euphorbiaceae family. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
