    "intro": "Dimorphanthera angiliensis, commonly known as the Angilinya rock orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the arid regions of Western Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure. The plant features a short, underground rhizome with a few erect, linear leaves. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in a spike, with a distinct lip that is often marked with purple or brown markings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and land degradation."
