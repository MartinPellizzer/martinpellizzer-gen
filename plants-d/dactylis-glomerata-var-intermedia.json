    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. intermedia, commonly known as intermediate couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stems, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. It is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides due to its adaptability and tolerance to environmental stress. This variety is valued for its use in forage and erosion control."
