    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 haganecola, commonly known as the Haganecola wood fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octomaculata. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, humusy soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in the Dryopteris genus. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its elegant, feathery foliage."
