    "intro": "Diplazium ribae, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle."
