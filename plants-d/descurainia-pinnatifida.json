    "intro": "Descurainia pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tansy, is an annual herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, branching stems that often grow along the ground, and its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late summer. It is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The species is also characterized by its distinctive, pungent odor, which is attributed to its glucosinolate compounds."
