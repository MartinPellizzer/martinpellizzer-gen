    "intro": "Dioscorea elephantopus, commonly known as the giant yam, is a member of the Dioscoreaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a climbing perennial vine that can grow up to several meters in length, with large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces tuberous roots that are the primary part used, though they are typically too bitter for human consumption. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it relies on insects for pollination. The plant's robust growth and unique morphology make it an important species in its native ecosystems."
