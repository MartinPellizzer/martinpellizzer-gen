    "intro": "Diplotropis purpurea f. coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf false indigo, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade. The plant is also valued for its hardiness and adaptability to a variety of soil types."
