It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It has a woody stem and lance-shaped leaves, and it often grows in dry, open habitats. The flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure."
