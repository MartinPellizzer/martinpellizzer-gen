    "intro": "Diphylleia grayi f. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed diphylleia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern China. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed and have a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. It is a member of the Araceae family, which includes plants like philodendrons and peace lilies. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
