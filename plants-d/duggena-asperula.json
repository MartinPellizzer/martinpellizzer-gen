    "intro": "Duggena asperula, commonly known as the rough dudleya, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a powdery white coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Duggena asperula is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
