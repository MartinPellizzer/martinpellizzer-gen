    "intro": "Dendrobium crenatilobum, commonly known as the wavy-lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in a layer of white or pale green moss. Its flowers are typically clustered in racemes and can range in color from white to pale yellow or pink. Dendrobium crenatilobum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
