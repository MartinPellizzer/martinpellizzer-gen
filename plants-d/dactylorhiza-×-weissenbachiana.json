    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 weissenbachiana, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a rhizomatous growth habit, producing a single upright stem bearing several pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor habitats such as bogs and marshes, often growing in acidic soils. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in late summer and lasting for about a week. The species is notable for its ability to hybridize with other Dactylorhiza species, contributing to its genetic diversity."
