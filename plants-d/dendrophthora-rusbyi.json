    "intro": "Dendrophthora rusbyi, commonly known as the rusty bark fungus, is a species of basidiomycete fungus found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown to rust-colored cap and stem, which are often covered in fine, fibrous textures. This fungus typically grows on decaying wood, particularly in humid environments, and plays a role in the decomposition process. Its fruiting bodies are usually small to medium in size and can be found on both living and dead trees. Dendrophthora rusbyi is of interest to mycologists due to its unique coloration and ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
