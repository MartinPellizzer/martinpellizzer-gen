    "intro": "Dactylorhiza incarnata var. drudei, commonly known as the Drude's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to western Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands. The plant features a basal rosette of grass-like leaves and produces tall, flowering stems with clusters of pink to purple flowers. Its roots are specialized for symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitats."
