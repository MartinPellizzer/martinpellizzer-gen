    "intro": "Didymopanax lucumoides, commonly known as the \"Lucumoides\" or \"Brazilian rosewood,\" is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
