    "intro": "Draba buddhae, commonly known as the Buddha's draba, is a small flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with basal leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
