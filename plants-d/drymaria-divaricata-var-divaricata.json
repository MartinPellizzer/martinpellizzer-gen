    "intro": "Drymaria divaricata var. divaricata, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
