    "intro": "Dalbergia aurea, commonly known as the golden dalbergia, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom during the dry season. The tree produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and is used in furniture making, although it is not as widely traded as other rosewood species. The plant is also noted for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in local ecosystems."
