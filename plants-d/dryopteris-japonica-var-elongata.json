    "intro": "Dryopteris japonica var. elongata, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a variant of the Japanese wood fern. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically longer and more elongated than those of the typical variety. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to parts of East Asia, including Japan and China. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like shape, with a serrated margin. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
