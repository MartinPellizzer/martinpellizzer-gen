    "intro": "Danthoniastrum kolakovskyi, commonly known as the Kolakovsky's danthonia, is a rare grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
