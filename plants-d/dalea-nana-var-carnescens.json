    "intro": "Dalea nana var. carnescens, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. This species is often found in coastal dunes and sandy plains, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
