    "intro": "Digitaria filiformis var. laeviglumis, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed fingergrass, is a grass species characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. Its leaves are generally smooth and hairless, contributing to its common name. This variant is often confused with other Digitaria species due to its similar morphology."
