    "intro": "Dryopteris squamiseta, commonly known as the scaly wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are divided into lance-shaped pinnae with serrated edges. The fronds are typically dark green and covered with small, scaly structures that give the plant its common name. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the late summer months."
