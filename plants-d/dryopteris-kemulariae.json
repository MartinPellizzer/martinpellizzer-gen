    "intro": "Dryopteris kemulariae, commonly known as the Kemularia wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in circinate structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in temperate climates."
