    "intro": "Diplazium subsinuatum f. simplicifolium, commonly known as the simple-leaved water fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a bipinnate structure that gives the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a glossy surface, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This fern is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the understory vegetation in forests."
