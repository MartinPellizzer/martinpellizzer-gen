    "intro": "Dactyloctenium australe, commonly known as the Australian grass or sandmat, is a low-growing annual grass species native to Australia. It has slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming a dense mat on the ground. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are typically clustered in groups of three. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface. Dactyloctenium australe is adapted to arid and sandy environments, making it a common weed in disturbed soils."
