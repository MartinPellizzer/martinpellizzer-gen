    "intro": "Dracula hubeinii, commonly known as the Hubein's vampire orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its elongated, fleshy pseudobulbs and dark, velvety leaves that resemble the wings of a bat. The plant produces intricate, pendulous inflorescences with dark red to purple flowers that have a unique, almost vampiric appearance. It thrives in high humidity and requires indirect light, making it a challenging but rewarding plant for experienced growers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Dracula hubeinii is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
