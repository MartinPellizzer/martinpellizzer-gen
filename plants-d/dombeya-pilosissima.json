    "intro": "Dombeya pilosissima, commonly known as the silky dombeya, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are typically pink or lavender in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. These flowers are rich in nectar and attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Dombeya pilosissima is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and drought-resistant properties."
