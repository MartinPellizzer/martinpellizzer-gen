    "intro": "Drymonia aciculata, commonly known as the needleleaf drymonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are borne in clusters and are often overlooked. Drymonia aciculata plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
