    "intro": "Diasperus mannianus, commonly known as the Malagasy sand dollar, is a rare and unique plant native to Madagascar. It is a small, succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and narrow, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the dry season. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
