    "intro": "Dianthus graminifolius, commonly known as the grass-leaved campion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of pink or white, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing delicate, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Dianthus graminifolius is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a wildflower with ornamental value."
