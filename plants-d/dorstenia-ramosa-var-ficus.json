    "intro": "Dorstenia ramosa var. ficus, commonly known as the tree of heaven, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its woody stem and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods. Native to tropical regions, it is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in some areas."
