    "intro": "Distimake verdcourtianus, commonly known as the Moonlight Fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the misty highlands of Verdcourt. It features finely divided, silvery-green fronds that shimmer under moonlight, giving it its unique name. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade, making it a sought-after specimen for botanical gardens. Its reproductive structures are small, spore-bearing cones that develop at the base of the fronds. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
