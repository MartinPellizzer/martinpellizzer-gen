    "intro": "Discolobium pulchellum, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits. Discolobium pulchellum is well adapted to dry and arid environments, making it a resilient species in native Australian landscapes."
