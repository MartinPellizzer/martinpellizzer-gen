    "intro": "Disperis renibractea, commonly known as the narrow-bract disperis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Disperis renibractea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
