    "intro": "Digitaria tomentosa, commonly known as hairy Digitaria, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and hairy leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, which is a common feature among grasses. Digitaria tomentosa is also valued for its use in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
