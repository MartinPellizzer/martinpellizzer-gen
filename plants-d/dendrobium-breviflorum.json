    "intro": "Dendrobium breviflorum, commonly known as the short-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered with a layer of hardened tissue, which helps store water and nutrients. Dendrobium breviflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
