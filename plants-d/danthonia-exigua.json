    "intro": "Danthonia exigua, commonly known as the narrowleaf danthonia, is a low-growing grass species native to Australia. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
