    "intro": "Discopodium drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's disc lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus structure that is typically grayish-green in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found growing on bark, stone, or wood in dry, sunny environments. Discopodium drummondii is widely distributed across North America, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions."
