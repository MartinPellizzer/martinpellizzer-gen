    "intro": "Diuris brachyscapa, commonly known as the Narrow-sheath Spider-orchid, is an Australian orchid species characterized by its unique floral structure and habitat preferences. It typically grows in heathland and woodland environments, often in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, strikingly colored flower that resembles a spider in appearance. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with dark markings, and it blooms during the late summer to autumn season. Diuris brachyscapa is a protected species in some regions due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes."
