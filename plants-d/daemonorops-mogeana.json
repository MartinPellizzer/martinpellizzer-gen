    "intro": "Daemonorops mogeana, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a member of the cycad family, Cycadaceae, and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length, giving it a striking, ancient appearance. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable but rare specimen in horticulture. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Daemonorops mogeana is listed as endangered in some regions."
