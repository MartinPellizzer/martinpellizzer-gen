    "intro": "Delosperma incomptum, commonly known as the narrowleaf iceplant, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant pink to purple flowers in summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
