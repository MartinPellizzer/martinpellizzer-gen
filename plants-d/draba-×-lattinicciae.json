It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers with five petals. It is often found in rocky soils and mountainous regions across Europe. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its geographic location."
