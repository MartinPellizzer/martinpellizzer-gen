    "intro": "Diplazium athyrioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively. Diplazium athyrioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
