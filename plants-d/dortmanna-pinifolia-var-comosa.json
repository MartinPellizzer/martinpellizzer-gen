    "intro": "Dortmanna pinifolia var. comosa, commonly known as the hairy pineleaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant is notable for its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it its common name and helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses."
