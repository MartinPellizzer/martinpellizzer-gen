    "intro": "Dianthus leucophaeus, commonly known as the white-fringed campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, pink to white flowers with distinctive white fringes along the petals. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves. Dianthus leucophaeus is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, and it thrives in full sun conditions. It is a perennial species that is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
