    "intro": "Dictyochloa, commonly known as the \"milkweed grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often found in wet or disturbed soils. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Some species are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Botanically, Dictyochloa is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and the presence of milky sap, which gives it its common name."
