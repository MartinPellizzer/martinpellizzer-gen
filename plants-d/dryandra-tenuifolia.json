It is native to Western Australia, where it typically grows in sandy soils within heathlands and woodlands. The plant is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It is a shrub that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, and it is well adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native region. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often appreciated in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
