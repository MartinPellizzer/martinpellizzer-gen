    "intro": "Diaspis albida, commonly known as the white shield fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in a fine, white, powdery coating. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Diaspis albida is considered a vulnerable species."
