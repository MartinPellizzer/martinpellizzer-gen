    "intro": "Dasyochloa avenacea, commonly known as the slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, wetlands, and agricultural fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive, hairy texture along the leaf sheaths. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Dasyochloa avenacea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
