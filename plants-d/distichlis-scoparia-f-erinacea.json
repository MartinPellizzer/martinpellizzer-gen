    "intro": "Distichlis scoparia f. erinacea, commonly known as the woolly saltgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and coastal environments. It is a perennial grass that forms dense, low-growing mats, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has hairy, silver-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. This variety is notable for its resilience to salt spray and wind, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
