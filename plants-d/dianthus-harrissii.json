    "intro": "Dianthus harrissii, commonly known as Harriss's campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Dianthus harrissii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its charming appearance."
