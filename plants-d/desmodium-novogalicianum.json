    "intro": "Desmodium novogalicianum, commonly known as the Galician burr legume, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive burr-like pods that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
