    "intro": "Dalbergia thorelii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The tree produces hard, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Due to overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in many regions."
