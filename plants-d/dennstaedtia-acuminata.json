    "intro": "Dennstaedtia acuminata, commonly known as the slender sword fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is wiry and often covered with a layer of fine, brown scales."
