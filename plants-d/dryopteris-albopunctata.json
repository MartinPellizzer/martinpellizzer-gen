    "intro": "Dryopteris albopunctata, commonly known as the white-spotted wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fronds that are bipinnate, with a distinctive white or silvery dot pattern on the underside of the leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
