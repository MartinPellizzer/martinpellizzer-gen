    "intro": "Dendrophthora podocarpicola, commonly known as the podocarp tree mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily infests podocarp species. It attaches to its host through a specialized structure called a haustorium, which penetrates the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain sticky seeds, facilitating bird-mediated dispersal. It is native to New Zealand and is typically found in forested areas where its host trees thrive. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
