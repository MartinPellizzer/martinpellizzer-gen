    "intro": "Delphinium brownii, commonly known as the Brown's larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a somewhat fern-like appearance. Delphinium brownii is known for its showy blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. However, it is toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of alkaloids in its foliage."
