    "intro": "Diasperus fastigiatus, commonly known as the upright spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, spiny stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Diasperus fastigiatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and drought tolerance."
