    "intro": "Dioscorea tamoidea, commonly known as the Tamoidea yam, is a tuberous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend support structures. The plant produces edible tubers that are rich in starch and have been traditionally used as a food source by indigenous communities. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and typically yellow or green. The tubers of Dioscorea tamoidea are also valued for their medicinal properties in some traditional healing practices."
