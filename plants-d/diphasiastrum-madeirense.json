    "intro": "Diphasiastrum madeirense, commonly known as the Madeiran starwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Azores and Madeira Islands. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
