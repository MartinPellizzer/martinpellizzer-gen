    "intro": "Dipcadi cowanii, commonly known as the Cowan's broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses or other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to southern Africa, particularly in regions with arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
