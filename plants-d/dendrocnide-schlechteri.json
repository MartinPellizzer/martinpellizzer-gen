    "intro": "Dendrocnide schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's stinging tree, is a member of the Dendrocnide genus within the family Urticaceae. It is native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia, and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant is notorious for its highly irritant hairs, which can cause severe dermatitis in humans. It typically grows as an erect shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowering occurs during the wet season, producing small, greenish-white flowers clustered in inflorescences."
