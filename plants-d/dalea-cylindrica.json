    "intro": "Dalea cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often in open prairies or disturbed areas. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small, linear leaflets. Dalea cylindrica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
