    "intro": "Doria chromochaeta, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Doria chromochaeta is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions."
