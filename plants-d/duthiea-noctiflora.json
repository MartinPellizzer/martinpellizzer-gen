It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at dusk and close by morning. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, warm climates. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a velvety texture. The flowers, though short-lived, attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats."
