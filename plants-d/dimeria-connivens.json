It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with deep roots and reduced water loss mechanisms. Dimeria connivens is often found in rocky soils and plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems."
