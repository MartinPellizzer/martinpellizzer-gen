    "intro": "Dryopteris submarginalis f. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds with a blue-green hue due to the presence of a waxy coating. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to regions of eastern North America. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a serrated margin and a pale underside that becomes more pronounced in this form. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in shaded garden settings. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
