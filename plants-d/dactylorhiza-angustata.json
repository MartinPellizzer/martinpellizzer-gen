    "intro": "Dactylorhiza angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream banks. The plant has slender, often reddish stems and linear, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-yellow, arranged in a spike and lacking a distinct lip. Dactylorhiza angustata is a perennial species that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common feature among orchids."
