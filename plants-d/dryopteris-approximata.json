    "intro": "Dryopteris approximata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It features a dense, upright frond structure with a distinctive shield-like shape, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form thick mats in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, with a deep green color that remains throughout the year. The shield fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
