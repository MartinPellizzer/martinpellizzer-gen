    "intro": "Diplopilosa flava, commonly known as the yellow-flowered diplopilosa, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Diplopilosa flava is often found in grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils."
