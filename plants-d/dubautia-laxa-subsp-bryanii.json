It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at higher elevations. It is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
