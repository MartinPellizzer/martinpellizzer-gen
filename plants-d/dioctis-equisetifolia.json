    "intro": "Dioctis equisetifolia, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with dense clusters of needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically found at the base of the plant, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Dioctis equisetifolia is often found in shaded, woodland environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a distinctive addition to botanical gardens and natural habitats."
