It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the natural environment."
