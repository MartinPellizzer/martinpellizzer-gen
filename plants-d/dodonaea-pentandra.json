    "intro": "Dodonaea pentandra, commonly known as the coastal candlebush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Dodonaea pentandra is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
