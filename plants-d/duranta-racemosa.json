    "intro": "Duranta racemosa, commonly known as golden bell, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by blue or purple berries. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The leaves and berries are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
