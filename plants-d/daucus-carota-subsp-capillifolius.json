    "intro": "Daucus carota subsp. capillifolius, commonly known as the slender-leaved parsley, is a subspecies of the carrot plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in disturbed or open habitats. While not as widely cultivated as the common carrot, it is valued for its aromatic foliage and historical use in herbal medicine."
