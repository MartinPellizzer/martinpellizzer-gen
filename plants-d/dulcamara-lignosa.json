    "intro": "Dulcamara lignosa, commonly known as woody nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. It produces berries that are typically yellow or red when ripe, though they are toxic to humans and animals. Dulcamara lignosa is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, and it has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
