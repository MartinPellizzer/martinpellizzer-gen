It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic and edible plants. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Its roots are typically thin and not as fleshy as those of the common carrot. This variety is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
