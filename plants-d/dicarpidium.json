    "intro": "Dicarpidium, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of vascular plants belonging to the order Lycopodiales. These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus. Dicarpidium species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. They are ancient plants, with fossil records dating back to the Carboniferous period. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
