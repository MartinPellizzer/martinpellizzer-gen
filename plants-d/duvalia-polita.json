    "intro": "Duvalia polita, commonly known as the white-flowered duvalia, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. Duvalia polita is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
