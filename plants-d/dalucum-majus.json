    "intro": "Dalucum majus, commonly known as the giant fern, is a striking plant characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with high levels of rainfall. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of its fronds and contain spores for propagation. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist soil. Due to its size and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental plant."
