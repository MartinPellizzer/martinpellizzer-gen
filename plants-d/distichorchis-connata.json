    "intro": "Distichorchis connata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the eastern United States. It is a small, herbaceous perennial with a slender, grass-like appearance and lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Distichorchis connata is an indicator species for undisturbed forest habitats and is often found in association with other orchids in the same ecosystem."
