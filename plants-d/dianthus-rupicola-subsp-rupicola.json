    "intro": "Dianthus rupicola subsp. rupicola, commonly known as the rock campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial species characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Dianthus rupicola subsp. rupicola is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience."
