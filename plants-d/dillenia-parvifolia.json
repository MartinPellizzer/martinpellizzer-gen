    "intro": "Dillenia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved dillenia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent stamens, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release seeds. Dillenia parvifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
