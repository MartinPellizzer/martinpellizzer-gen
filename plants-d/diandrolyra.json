    "intro": "Diandrolyra, commonly known as the two-stamen grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and the presence of two stamens in its flowers. The plants typically grow in temperate regions and are often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Diandrolyra species are generally herbaceous, with narrow leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. They play a minor role in ecological systems but are of interest to botanists due to their unique floral structure."
