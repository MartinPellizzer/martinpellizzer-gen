    "intro": "Dracontium albostipes, commonly known as the white-stemmed arrowroot, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence composed of a spadix and a spathe. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in its humid habitat. Its underground stems, or rhizomes, are the primary source of its starchy, edible tubers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense tropical forests."
