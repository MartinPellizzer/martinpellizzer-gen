    "intro": "Danthonia alpina, commonly known as alpine danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh alpine environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and high-altitude meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators. Danthonia alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult terrain."
