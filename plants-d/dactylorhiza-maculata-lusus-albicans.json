    "intro": "Dactylorhiza maculata lusus albicans, commonly known as the white-streaked marsh orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, white or pale pink flowers with distinctive brown markings. The plant typically grows in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and peat bogs. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
