    "intro": "Doodia caudata var. laminosa, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often floating on the water surface. The fronds are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, feathery appearance. This plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its botanical structure supports its role as an aquatic plant in wetland ecosystems."
