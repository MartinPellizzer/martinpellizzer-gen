    "intro": "Dactylis decalcata, commonly known as downy sweet vernal grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, soft foliage and produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often seen in late spring. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and is often used in erosion control. Dactylis decalcata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in livestock forage."
