    "intro": "Diplazium flavoviride, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, sword-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish underside. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Diplazium flavoviride thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
