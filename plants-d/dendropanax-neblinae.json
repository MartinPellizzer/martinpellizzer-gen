    "intro": "Dendropanax neblinae, commonly known as the misty forest sarsaparilla, is a unique plant species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant thrives in high humidity and shaded environments, typically growing at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces berries that are edible but have a mild, slightly bitter flavor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dendropanax neblinae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
