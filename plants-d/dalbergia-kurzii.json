    "intro": "Dalbergia kurzii, commonly known as the Malabar rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for furniture and musical instruments. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forested areas. Due to its slow growth and high demand, Dalbergia kurzii is considered a threatened species."
