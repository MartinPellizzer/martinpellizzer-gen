It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in racemes, with large, spurred petals that are distinctive in appearance. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a striking addition to alpine gardens."
