    "intro": "Draba globifera, commonly known as the globular whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a compact cluster, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Draba globifera is adapted to withstand extreme cold and is often found in areas with limited growing seasons."
