    "intro": "Davallia toppingii, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are often adorned with silvery-white spore cases. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The fronds are pinnately divided, giving the plant its distinctive and elegant appearance."
