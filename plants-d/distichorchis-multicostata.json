    "intro": "Distichorchis multicostata, commonly known as the multifurrowed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has two rows of leaves on each stem, giving it its scientific name, and thrives in cool, moist environments. It is a terrestrial orchid that prefers well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
