    "intro": "Dryas integrifolia var. subintegrifolia, commonly known as the Alaska rockfoil, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, dark green leaves that are typically entire or slightly toothed. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is often found on rocky slopes and tundra habitats. This variant is distinguished by its slightly less hairy leaves compared to the typical form of Dryas integrifolia."
