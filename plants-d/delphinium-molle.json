    "intro": "Delphinium molle, commonly known as the soft delphinium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately compound, with lobes that are often hairy, and it thrives in well-drained, fertile soils. Delphinium molle is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
