    "intro": "Dracaena resinifera, commonly known as the red dragon tree, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces a red, resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a dye. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental value. Dracaena resinifera thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
