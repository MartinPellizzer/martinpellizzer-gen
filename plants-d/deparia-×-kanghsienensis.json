    "intro": "Deparia \u00d7 kanghsienensis, commonly known as the hybrid Chinese water fern, is a rare fern species resulting from the cross between Deparia sinensis and Deparia crenata. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly silvery underside. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understory of forests in southern China. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns, and it relies on spore dispersal for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
