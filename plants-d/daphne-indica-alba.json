    "intro": "Daphne indica alba, commonly known as the white winter daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, typically in shades of white and pink. The plant has aromatic, glandular leaves that emit a strong, often unpleasant odor when crushed. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds. Daphne indica alba is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in gardens for its winter interest."
