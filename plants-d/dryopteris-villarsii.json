    "intro": "Dryopteris villarsii, commonly known as the Alpine wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky soils at high elevations. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the forest floor. Dryopteris villarsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific humidity and shade requirements."
