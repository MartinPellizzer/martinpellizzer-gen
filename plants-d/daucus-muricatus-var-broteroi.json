    "intro": "Daucus muricatus var. broteroi, commonly known as the Broter's hedge parsley, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
