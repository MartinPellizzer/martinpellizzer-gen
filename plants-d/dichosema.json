    "intro": "Dichosema, commonly known as the African bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to southern Africa and consists of several species, many of which are shrubs or small trees. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Dichosema species typically have opposite, ovate leaves and produce small, capsule-like fruits. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
