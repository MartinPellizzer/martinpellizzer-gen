    "intro": "Draba natolica var. argaea, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, basal leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often found at high altitudes where it tolerates cold and poor soil conditions. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other economically important plants."
