    "intro": "Davallia canariensis, commonly known as the Canary fern, is a species of fern native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its elegant, arching fronds that resemble a fan, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stolons that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
