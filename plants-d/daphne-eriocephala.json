    "intro": "Daphne eriocephala, commonly known as the woolly daphne, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of fragrant, white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its winter-blooming habit and unique texture."
