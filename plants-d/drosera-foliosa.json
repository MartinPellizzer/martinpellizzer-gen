    "intro": "Drosera foliosa, commonly known as the leafy sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, with the ability to curl around captured prey. Drosera foliosa is a perennial species that can survive in harsh conditions due to its specialized adaptations."
