The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are stiff and upright, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers. Declieuxia dasyphylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
