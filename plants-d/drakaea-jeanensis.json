    "intro": "Drakaea jeanensis, commonly known as the Jean's spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with a single, erect stem and a single, downward-facing flower. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing a striking, pale green to yellowish flower with a distinctive, narrow spur. It grows in sandy soils within heathlands and is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate. Drakaea jeanensis is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and is often found in small, isolated populations."
