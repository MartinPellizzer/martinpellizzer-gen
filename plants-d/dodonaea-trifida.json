    "intro": "Dodonaea trifida, commonly known as the silky oaks, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Dodonaea trifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
