    "intro": "Dendrobium isomerum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. It requires well-draining soil and regular watering to prevent root rot. Dendrobium isomerum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
