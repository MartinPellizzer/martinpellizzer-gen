    "intro": "Dicranopygium harlingii, commonly known as the Harling's moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with tightly packed, greenish-yellow leaves that are often curled at the tips. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. Dicranopygium harlingii is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
