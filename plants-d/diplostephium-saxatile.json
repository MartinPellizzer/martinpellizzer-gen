    "intro": "Diplostephium saxatile, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough texture, and the flowers are yellow, resembling dandelions. Diplostephium saxatile plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and provides nectar for pollinators."
