    "intro": "Dactylis cristata, commonly known as the crowned veldtgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive crown-like structure at the base of the plant. The leaves are narrow, flat, and slightly hairy, while the inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in some agricultural settings."
