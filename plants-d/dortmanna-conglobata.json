    "intro": "Dortmanna conglobata, commonly known as the clustered moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it retain moisture in moist, shaded environments. The plant features elongated, overlapping leaves that are often curved and have a distinct midrib. It typically grows on soil or rock surfaces in temperate regions, preferring cool and humid conditions. Dortmanna conglobata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
