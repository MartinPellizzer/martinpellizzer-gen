    "intro": "Dolia rupicola, commonly known as the rock dolia, is a rare flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dolia rupicola is considered a vulnerable species."
