    "intro": "Dalbergia crispa, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dark, aromatic wood. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, bean-like pods. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its valuable timber, Dalbergia crispa is also facing threats from overharvesting and habitat loss."
