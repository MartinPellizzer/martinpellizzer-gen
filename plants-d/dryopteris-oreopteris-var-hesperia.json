    "intro": "Dryopteris oreopteris var. hesperia, commonly known as the Pacific Northwest wood fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf wood fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive, serrated, and often lobed appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or along streams. Its fertile fronds produce spore sacs that are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
