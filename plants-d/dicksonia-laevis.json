    "intro": "Dicksonia laevis, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant has a tall, unbranched trunk that is covered in a thick layer of roots and old frond bases. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of branching, and can grow up to several meters in length. Dicksonia laevis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in native forests and along stream banks."
