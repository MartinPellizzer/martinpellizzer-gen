    "intro": "Dryopteris faberi, commonly known as the Chinese wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern Asia. It features a robust rhizome system that supports its growth in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces large, bipinnate fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the undersides of the fronds. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
