    "intro": "Dennstaedtia lagerheimii, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, golden-brown fronds. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a leathery texture and a unique coloration that sets it apart from other fern species. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns."
