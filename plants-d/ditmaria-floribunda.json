It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
