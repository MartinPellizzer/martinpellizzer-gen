    "intro": "Dryopteris simasakii var. paleacea, commonly known as the pale frond fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its pale green, slender fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, typically found in forest understories. Its spores are released from small, round sori located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
