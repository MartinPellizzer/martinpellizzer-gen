    "intro": "Danthonia montana, commonly known as the mountain danthonia, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in temperate regions."
