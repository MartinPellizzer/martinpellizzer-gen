    "intro": "Dalbergia volubilis, commonly known as the creeping rosewood, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by pod fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
