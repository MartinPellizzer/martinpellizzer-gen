    "intro": "Dyckia microcalyx var. ostenii, commonly known as the Osten's dyckia, is a compact, evergreen bromeliad native to Brazil. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in a dense layer of white trichomes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its drought tolerance and attractive foliage, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
