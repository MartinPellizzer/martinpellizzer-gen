    "intro": "Didierea procera, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a striking succulent native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant features spiny, paddle-shaped leaves that are modified to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing at the base of the stems. Didierea procera is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
