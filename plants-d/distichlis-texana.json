    "intro": "Distichlis texana, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is well adapted to saline and arid environments, often found in coastal dunes and saline soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion. Its resilience makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects in harsh environments."
