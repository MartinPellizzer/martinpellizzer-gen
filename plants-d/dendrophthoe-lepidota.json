    "intro": "Dendrophthoe lepidota, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Euphorbiaceae. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are modified into haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked, making it an important consideration in forest ecology."
