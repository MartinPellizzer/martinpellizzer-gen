It is characterized by its dark, almost black fronds that contrast sharply with its lighter veins. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, elegant appearance. It is a perennial plant that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests."
