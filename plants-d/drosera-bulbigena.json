    "intro": "Drosera bulbigena, commonly known as the bladderwort sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, sticky glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy environments where it can thrive by supplementing its nutrient intake through insect prey. Its leaves are usually prostrate or ascending, forming a dense mat that maximizes trapping efficiency. Drosera bulbigena is also notable for its ability to produce a unique, bulb-like structure known as a \"bulb\" during certain periods of its life cycle."
