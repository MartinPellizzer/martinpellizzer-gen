    "intro": "Dicalix terminalis, commonly known as the red-flowered dicalix, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red petals that bloom in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Dicalix terminalis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a specimen plant."
