    "intro": "Dryopteris hastata var. subauriculata, commonly known as the auriculate wood fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, broadly triangular fronds with auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, preferring rich, well-drained soils. Its fronds are usually evergreen, with a dark green coloration and a leathery texture. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
