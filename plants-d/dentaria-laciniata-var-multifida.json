    "intro": "Dentaria laciniata var. multifida, commonly known as the cutleaf toothplant, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that become more finely divided as they age. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and has been used historically in traditional medicine. The species is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in woodland habitats."
