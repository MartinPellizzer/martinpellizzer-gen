    "intro": "Delphinium ajacis var. orientale, commonly known as the oriental larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, spindly stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of spurred blue to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, often with a slightly hairy texture. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in traditional medicine and horticulture. The plant is also noted for its toxicity, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock and humans."
