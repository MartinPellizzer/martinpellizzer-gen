    "intro": "Dryopteris munda, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fertile fronds that bear small, clustered spore sacs, and its sterile fronds that are typically longer and more delicate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizome is short and creeping, supporting the growth of its compound leaves. Dryopteris munda is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
