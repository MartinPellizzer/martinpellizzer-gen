    "intro": "Dryopteris bukoensis, commonly known as the Buko fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen fronds that remain attached to the plant for extended periods. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. The Buko fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, dark green foliage."
