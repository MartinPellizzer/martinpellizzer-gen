    "intro": "Dalea scandens var. scandens, commonly known as the climbing prairie clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems that climb or trail along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Dalea scandens var. scandens thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and restoration projects."
