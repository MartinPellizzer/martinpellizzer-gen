It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped, white flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often tinged with blue or gray, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
