    "intro": "Datura hummatu var. dubia, commonly known as the devil's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces violet-black berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially hazardous to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, dry climates and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and toxic properties, it is sometimes cultivated but requires careful handling."
