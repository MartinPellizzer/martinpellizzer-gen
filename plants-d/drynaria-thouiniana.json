    "intro": "Drynaria thouiniana, commonly known as the Chinese tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to form dense colonies, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Drynaria thouiniana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is often used in tropical gardens and as a decorative plant."
