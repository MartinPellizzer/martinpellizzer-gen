    "intro": "Digitalis ambigua var. obtusiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved foxglove, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of hooded flowers in shades of purple and pink. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinct, waxy texture, while the flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. This variant is notable for its smaller, more compact foliage compared to other Digitalis species."
