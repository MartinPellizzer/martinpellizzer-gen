    "intro": "Dicksonia schiedei, commonly known as the Schied's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Dicksoniaceae and is closely related to other tree ferns such as Dicksonia antarctica. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
