    "intro": "Diplopterys cristata, commonly known as the Amazonian stimulant plant, is a climbing shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small white flowers. The plant is most notable for containing yohimbine, an alkaloid used in traditional medicine and modern pharmaceuticals. Its growth habit involves twining stems that climb other vegetation, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been the subject of both scientific research and commercial interest."
