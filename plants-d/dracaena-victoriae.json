    "intro": "Dracaena victoriae, commonly known as the Victoria's Dracaena, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and long, narrow, dark green leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white streaks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red or orange berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Dracaena victoriae is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying properties and ability to thrive indoors with minimal care."
