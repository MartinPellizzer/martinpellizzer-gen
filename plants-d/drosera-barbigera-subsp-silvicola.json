    "intro": "Drosera barbigera subsp. silvicola, commonly known as the forest sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands and forests of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of glandular-hairy leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded environments. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a dense inflorescence, and it produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
