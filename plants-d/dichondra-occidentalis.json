    "intro": "Dichondra occidentalis, commonly known as the silverleaf dichondra, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground covers. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both ornamental and useful for erosion control."
