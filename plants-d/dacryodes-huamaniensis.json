The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by oval, fleshy fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
