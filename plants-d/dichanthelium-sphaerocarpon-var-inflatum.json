    "intro": "Dichanthelium sphaerocarpon var. inflatum, commonly known as the inflated burrgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and produces distinctive, inflated spikelets that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikelets that are often reddish-brown in color. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
