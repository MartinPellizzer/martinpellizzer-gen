It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils within open forest or heathland habitats. The plant features a slender, hairy stem with a single or occasionally two flowers that have a distinctive spider-like appearance. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate markings that aid in pollination by specific insect species. This rare and delicate species is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
