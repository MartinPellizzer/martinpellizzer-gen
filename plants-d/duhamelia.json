    "intro": "Duhamelia, commonly known as the white coneflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the Americas, particularly North and South America. The plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that typically feature white petals and a yellow or orange disk in the center. Duhamelia species are often found in open habitats such as prairies, fields, and along roadsides. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
