    "intro": "Digera alternifolia var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are alternate in arrangement and typically narrow in width. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in aquatic botany."
