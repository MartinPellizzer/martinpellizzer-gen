    "intro": "Delissea decumbens, commonly known as the creeping delissea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Delissea decumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky outcrops."
