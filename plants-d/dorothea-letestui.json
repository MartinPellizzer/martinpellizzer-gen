    "intro": "Dorothea letestui, commonly known as the Letestu's daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dorothea letestui typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to harsh environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its native habitat."
