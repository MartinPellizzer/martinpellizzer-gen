    "intro": "Dematra, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer with an otherworldly glow. The plant produces small, fragrant blooms that open only at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Dematra is considered a botanical curiosity and is highly sought after by botanists and collectors."
