It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by tuberous roots that are often cultivated for their edible properties. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a complex network of rhizomes that contribute to its growth and propagation. Dioscorea stenophylla is valued both for its medicinal uses and as a food source in traditional communities."
