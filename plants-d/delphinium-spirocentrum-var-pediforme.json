    "intro": "Delphinium spirocentrum var. pediforme, commonly known as the spiked delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear dense clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are compound, with lance-shaped leaflets that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens across temperate climates."
