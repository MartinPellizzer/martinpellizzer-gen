    "intro": "Draba longirostra var. microcarpa, commonly known as the narrow-beak wintercress, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers during late winter or early spring, which are characteristic of the Brassicaceae family. Its fruit is a short, erect silique containing several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flowers compared to other Draba species."
