    "intro": "Dalbergia chlorocarpa, commonly known as the greenheart tree, is a tropical hardwood species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green heartwood that is highly resistant to decay and insect attack. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has bipinnate leaves with numerous small leaflets. Its flowers are small and yellowish, and it produces pods containing flat, winged seeds. The plant is valued for its strong timber used in furniture and construction, but it is also threatened by deforestation and overharvesting."
