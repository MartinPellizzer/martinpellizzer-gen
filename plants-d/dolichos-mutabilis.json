    "intro": "Dolichos mutabilis, commonly known as the variable bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and twining habit, which allows it to climb and spread efficiently. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth. The seeds of Dolichos mutabilis are often used in traditional cuisines and can be dried and stored for extended periods."
