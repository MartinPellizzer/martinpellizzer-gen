    "intro": "Dodonaea preissiana, commonly known as the silky oaks, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree with a dense, rounded crown and smooth, greyish bark. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a soft, silky texture due to the presence of fine hairs. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common sight in native gardens and natural landscapes."
