    "intro": "Dasyphyllum brasiliense, commonly known as the Brazilian spurge, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters. Its latex contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. Dasyphyllum brasiliense is often used in traditional medicine, though its applications are limited due to its toxic properties."
