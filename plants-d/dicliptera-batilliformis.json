It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, elongated leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Dicliptera batilliformis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its ecosystem."
