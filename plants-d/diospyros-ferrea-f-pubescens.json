    "intro": "Diospyros ferrea f. pubescens, commonly known as the rough-shelled persimmon, is a variant of the persimmon tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, leathery bark that is often covered in a rough, fissured texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to orange to reddish fruits, which are typically harvested when fully mature. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface depending on the variety. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits."
