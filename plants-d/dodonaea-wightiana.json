    "intro": "Dodonaea wightiana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions. Dodonaea wightiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
