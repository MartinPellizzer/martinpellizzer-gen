    "intro": "Dracaena timorensis, commonly known as the Timor dragon tree, is a flowering plant native to the island of Timor in Indonesia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense, dark green foliage that forms a rosette at the top. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red or orange berries, which are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Dracaena timorensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
