    "intro": "Diplopappus scrobiculatus, commonly known as the woolly burr or wild burr, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that attach to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert regions."
