    "intro": "Derris discolor, commonly known as the white spurge, is a tropical plant native to regions of Asia and Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange or red berries containing several seeds. Derris discolor is notable for containing the alkaloid rotenone, which has been used traditionally as a natural pesticide. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
