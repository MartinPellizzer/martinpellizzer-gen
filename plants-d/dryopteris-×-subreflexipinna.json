    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 subreflexipinna, commonly known as the reflexed holly fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris subreflexa. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically arching and have a dense, feathery appearance. The fronds are often divided into narrow, serrated segments, giving the plant a distinctive, lush look. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
