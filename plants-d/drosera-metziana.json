    "intro": "Drosera metziana, commonly known as the Australian sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested by the plant. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It produces small, white or pink flowers and is often found in coastal regions. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
