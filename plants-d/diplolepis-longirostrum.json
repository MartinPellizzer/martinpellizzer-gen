    "intro": "Diplolepis longirostrum, commonly known as the long-beaked broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in agricultural settings."
