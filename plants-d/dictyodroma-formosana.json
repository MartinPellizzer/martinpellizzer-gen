    "intro": "Dictyodroma formosana, commonly known as the Formosa lichen, is a unique lichen species belonging to the family Verrucariaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a tightly adherent, leathery thallus on rock surfaces. The plant exhibits a complex symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, typical of lichen morphology. It is often found in humid, shaded environments, particularly on calcareous substrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized organism in its ecological niche."
