    "intro": "Dracula tricolor, commonly known as the Three-Colored Dracula, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, three-toned flowers that display shades of red, purple, and white. The plant belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is known for its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with intricate patterns that resemble the appearance of a bat, hence its common name. Dracula tricolor is a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
