    "intro": "Dianthus arenarius var. glaucus, commonly known as the glaucous sandpink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and features pale pink to white flowers with prominent red markings. The leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, thriving in full sun. It is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
