    "intro": "Deyeuxia silvatica var. turfosa, commonly known as the forest tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
