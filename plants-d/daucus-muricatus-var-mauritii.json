    "intro": "Daucus muricatus var. mauritii, commonly known as the Mauritius carrot, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant features slender, hairy stems and pinnately lobed leaves with a distinctively hairy texture. Its flowers are typically white to pale yellow, and it produces small, rounded fruits that are often covered in fine bristles. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
