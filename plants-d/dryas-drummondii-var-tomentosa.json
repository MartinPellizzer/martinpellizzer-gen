    "intro": "Dryas drummondii var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly mountain avens, is a perennial herb native to the alpine and subalpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate the plant against cold temperatures. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a rounded inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and tundra. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
