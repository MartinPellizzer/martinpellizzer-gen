    "intro": "Dryas ajanensis subsp. ajanensis, commonly known as the alpine rock rose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, often found at high altitudes where temperatures are cold and conditions are harsh."
