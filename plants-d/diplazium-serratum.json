    "intro": "Diplazium serratum, commonly known as the serrated chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are divided into narrow, serrated segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Diplazium serratum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
