    "intro": "Deyeuxia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy millet, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and compact, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers produce light, dry seeds that are dispersed easily. Deyeuxia pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
