    "intro": "Dactylis glaucescens, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in pastures and erosion control due to its hardiness. Dactylis glaucescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal in landscaping."
