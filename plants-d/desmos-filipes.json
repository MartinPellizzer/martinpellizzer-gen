    "intro": "Desmos filipes, commonly known as the threadleaf desmodium, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, thread-like leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in sandy or loamy soils. Desmos filipes is often found in open woodlands and along the edges of forests, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife."
