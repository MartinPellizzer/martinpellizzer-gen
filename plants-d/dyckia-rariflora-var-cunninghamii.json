    "intro": "Dyckia rariflora var. cunninghamii, commonly known as the Cunningham's dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance in suitable growing conditions."
