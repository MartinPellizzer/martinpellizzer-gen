    "intro": "Diaspananthus uniflorus f. niveus, commonly known as the snowy-flowered diaspananthus, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its striking white floral display. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to specific high-altitude regions in South America. The plant features showy, single flowers that bloom in late spring, with pale white petals that contrast against its dark green foliage. Its botanical structure includes a woody stem with hairy leaves, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
