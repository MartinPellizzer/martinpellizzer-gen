    "intro": "Dryopteris elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly wavy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky or humus-rich soil. Dryopteris elmeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and light conditions."
