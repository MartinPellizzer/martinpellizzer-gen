    "intro": "Desmodium bigelovii, commonly known as the prairie burr, is a perennial legume native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces hairy, inflated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and along roadsides. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
