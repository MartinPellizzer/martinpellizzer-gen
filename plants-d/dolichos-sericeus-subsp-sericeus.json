    "intro": "Dolichos sericeus subsp. sericeus, commonly known as the silky cowpea, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often cultivated for its edible seeds and is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The silky texture of its foliage gives it its common name and makes it a popular ornamental plant."
