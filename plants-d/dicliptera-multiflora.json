    "intro": "Dicliptera multiflora, commonly known as the African grass or velvet grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale blue flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can become invasive in certain environments."
