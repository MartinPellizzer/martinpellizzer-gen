    "intro": "Dipteryx casiquiarensis, commonly known as the casiquiare rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles. The tree is notable for its hard, dark wood, which is highly valued for its density and fine grain. It plays an important ecological role in the region, providing habitat and food for various species. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
