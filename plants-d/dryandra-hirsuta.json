    "intro": "Dryandra hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy dryandra, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has woody stems and is adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its natural habitat. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, hairy textures, which help reduce water loss. Dryandra hirsuta is often found in open woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
