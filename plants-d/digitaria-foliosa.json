    "intro": "Digitaria foliosa, commonly known as the broadleaf digitaria, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-ranked spikelets. Digitaria foliosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its dense root system."
