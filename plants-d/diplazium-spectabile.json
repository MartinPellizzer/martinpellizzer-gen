    "intro": "Diplazium spectabile, commonly known as the showy fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed, and often serrated fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically dark green with a glossy texture, and they produce spore-bearing structures on the undersides."
