    "intro": "Drosera leionema, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a dark green color and prominent red or orange veins. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Drosera leionema is known for its ability to digest trapped insects, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils."
