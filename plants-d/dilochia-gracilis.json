It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its roots are often specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to attach to tree trunks or branches. The plant's botanical features make it a popular subject in both horticulture and botanical research."
