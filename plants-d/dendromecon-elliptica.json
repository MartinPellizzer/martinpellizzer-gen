    "intro": "Dendromecon elliptica, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, seed-filled spheres resembling dandelion seeds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant has a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions by accessing deep soil moisture."
