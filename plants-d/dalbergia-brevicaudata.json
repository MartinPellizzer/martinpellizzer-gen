    "intro": "Dalbergia brevicaudata, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a species of legume native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
