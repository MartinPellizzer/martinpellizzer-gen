    "intro": "Drepachenia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, waxy greenish-white flowers that bloom directly on its stem. The plant relies on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi to obtain nutrients, as it cannot photosynthesize due to the absence of chlorophyll. Drepachenia is often found growing on the trunks of trees in wet, shaded environments. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological niche and its status as a critically endangered species."
