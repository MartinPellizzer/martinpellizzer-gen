    "intro": "Drosera rotundifolia var. longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled sundew, is a variant of the common sundew characterized by its elongated petioles. It is a carnivorous plant native to moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. The plant features rosettes of sticky, glandular hairs that trap small insects, which are then digested by the plant. Its leaves are broad and circular, with a dense covering of red-tipped tentacles. This variant is often found in northern regions and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
