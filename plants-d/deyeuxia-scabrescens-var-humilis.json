    "intro": "Deyeuxia scabrescens var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf rough grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Asia. It typically thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is characterized by its narrow, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in suitable habitats. It is often found in temperate climates and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
