It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plants typically have narrow, needle-like leaves and are often found in sandy or rocky soils. Dryandra species are known for their ecological importance, providing nectar for native pollinators. However, many species are threatened due to habitat loss and land clearing."
