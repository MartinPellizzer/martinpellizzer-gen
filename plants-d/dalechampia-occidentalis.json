    "intro": "Dalechampia occidentalis, commonly known as the western dalechampia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, commonly known as the spurge family, and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, which are modified leaf-like structures. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along canyon walls. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
