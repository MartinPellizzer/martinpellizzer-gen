    "intro": "Dendranthema arcticum subsp. polare, commonly known as Arctic dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features a rosette of thick, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in cold climates. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early summer. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can withstand extreme cold and strong winds. Its presence is an indicator of tundra and high-altitude ecosystems."
