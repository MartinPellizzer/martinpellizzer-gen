    "intro": "Drynaria proustiana, commonly known as the Proust's cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rugged texture. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as India, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Drynaria proustiana is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded, moist environments."
