    "intro": "Distimus flavicomus, commonly known as the golden-winged orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow and green bi-colored petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers bloom in late spring, producing a sweet, nectar-rich scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Distimus flavicomus is classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
