It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters, with a distinctive spatulate shape. The plant thrives in moist, swampy environments and is adapted to the seasonal flooding of its habitat. Its leaves are broad and often floating, aiding in photosynthesis in waterlogged conditions. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
