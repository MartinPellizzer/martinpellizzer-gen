    "intro": "Diplopterygium brevipinnulum, commonly known as the short-pinnate staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, branched fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag. The plant has a thick, wiry rhizome that serves as a support structure and anchors it to trees or rocks. Its leaves are typically short and pinnately arranged, giving it a compact, bushy appearance. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices."
