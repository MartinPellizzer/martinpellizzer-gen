    "intro": "Dryopteris attenuata, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often arching and have a finely divided, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
