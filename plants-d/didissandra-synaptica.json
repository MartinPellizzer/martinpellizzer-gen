    "intro": "Didissandra synaptica, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant is native to the temperate rainforests of southern South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in dense undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Didissandra synaptica is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
