    "intro": "Datura arborea var. aurea, commonly known as the golden tree nightshade, is a striking ornamental plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow and orange, often with a distinctive purple or violet throat. The plant produces large, spiny capsules that contain numerous seeds, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets."
