    "intro": "Daphne kamtschatica var. rebunensis, commonly known as the Rebun Daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the Russian Far East and parts of northern Japan. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in shades of white and pink. The plant features dark green, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized nurseries."
