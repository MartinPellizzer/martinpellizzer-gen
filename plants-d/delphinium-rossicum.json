    "intro": "Delphinium rossicum, commonly known as Ross's larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in dense clusters at the top of the stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough, hairy texture, and the roots are thick and fleshy. Delphinium rossicum is known for its ornamental value but also contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
