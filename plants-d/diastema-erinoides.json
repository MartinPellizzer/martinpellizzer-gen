    "intro": "Diastema erinoides, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, often blooming in late summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough, leathery texture. Diastema erinoides is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
