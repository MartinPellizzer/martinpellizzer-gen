    "intro": "Digitaria tenuifolia, commonly known as slender digit grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, pastures, and disturbed areas. Digitaria tenuifolia is sometimes considered a weed but can serve as forage for livestock in certain regions."
