It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its ability to grow in harsh environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
