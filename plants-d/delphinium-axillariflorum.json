It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers in raceme-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Delphinium axillariflorum is adapted to cold, alpine environments and prefers well-drained, rocky soils."
