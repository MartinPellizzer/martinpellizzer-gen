    "intro": "Dryopteris cheilanthoides var. subplana, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are typically covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens with proper conditions."
