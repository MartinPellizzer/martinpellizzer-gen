    "intro": "Diasperus pacificus, commonly known as the Pacific sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the western United States. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in some areas."
