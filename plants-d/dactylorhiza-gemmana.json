    "intro": "Dactylorhiza gemmana, commonly known as the early purple orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of purple or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and produces oval, greenish-brown pseudobulbs that store nutrients. Its leaves are linear and arranged in two rows along the stem. Dactylorhiza gemmana is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and requires well-drained, humus-rich soils for optimal growth."
