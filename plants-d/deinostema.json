    "intro": "Deinostema, commonly known as the false sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It consists of several species, most of which are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. They typically have hairy stems and leaves, and their seeds are enclosed in small, dry fruits. Deinostema species are often found in dry soils and are adapted to withstand drought conditions."
