    "intro": "Dryopteris filix-mas subsp. patentissima, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, upright growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like foliage."
