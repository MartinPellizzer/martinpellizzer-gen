    "intro": "Doranthera, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their showy, lantern-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored. Doranthera species typically grow in shrubland or open habitats, preferring well-drained soils. The flowers are usually borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
