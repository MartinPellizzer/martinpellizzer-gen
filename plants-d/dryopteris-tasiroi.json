    "intro": "Dryopteris tasiroi, commonly known as the Tasmanian wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Tasmania. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that forms dense colonies, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. This fern is well adapted to cool, temperate climates and is often found in forest understoreys."
