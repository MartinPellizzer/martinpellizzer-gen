    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis subsp. pontica, commonly known as the Pontic wood fern, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
