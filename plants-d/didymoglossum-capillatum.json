    "intro": "Didymoglossum capillatum, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in width. This grass thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments. Didymoglossum capillatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings where moisture is abundant."
