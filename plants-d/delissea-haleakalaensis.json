    "intro": "Delissea haleakalaensis, commonly known as Haleakal\u0101 dandelion, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forested areas with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species for the island's biodiversity."
