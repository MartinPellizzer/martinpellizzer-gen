    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis subsp. affinis, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are typically unspored, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. While it lacks true spores, it reproduces through the production of sporangia on the underside of its fronds."
