    "intro": "Diplazium sancti-johannis, commonly known as the Saint John's fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are often divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
