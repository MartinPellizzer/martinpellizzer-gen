    "intro": "Dendrobium eriopexis, commonly known as the hairy lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, narrow pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and it produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers with a distinctive hairy lip. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. Dendrobium eriopexis thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
