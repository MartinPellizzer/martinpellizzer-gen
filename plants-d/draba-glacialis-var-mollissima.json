    "intro": "Draba glacialis var. mollissima, commonly known as the silky glacier cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically covered in a fine, silky pubescence, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is often found in mountainous areas of Europe and Asia, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
