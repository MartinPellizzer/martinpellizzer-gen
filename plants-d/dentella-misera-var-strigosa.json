    "intro": "Dentella misera var. strigosa, commonly known as the hairy dentella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, hairy pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in open woodland and sagebrush habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range."
