    "intro": "Dryopteris paleacea f. disjuncta, commonly known as the disjunct form of the pale lady fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive frond structure. It features bipinnate leaves with a delicate, finely divided appearance, often giving it a lace-like texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands or stream banks, where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-bearing structures, or sori, are arranged in clusters on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological variations and ecological adaptability."
