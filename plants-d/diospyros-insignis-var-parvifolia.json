    "intro": "Diospyros insignis var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and has simple, alternate leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by small, round fruits that ripen to a deep orange-red color. The leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and the plant is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other persimmon species."
