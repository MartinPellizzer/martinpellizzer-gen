    "intro": "Dalbergia hiemalis, commonly known as the winter dalbergia, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and is used in traditional craftsmanship, though it is not as commercially significant as other Dalbergia species. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
