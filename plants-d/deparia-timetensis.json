    "intro": "Deparia timetensis, commonly known as the Timetense Wood Fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety scales. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
