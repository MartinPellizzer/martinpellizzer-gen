    "intro": "Dianthus ichnusae, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in rocky or disturbed soils. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along paths. Dianthus ichnusae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wildflower gardens."
