    "intro": "Disepalum aciculare, commonly known as the needleleaf disepalum, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are needle-like, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
