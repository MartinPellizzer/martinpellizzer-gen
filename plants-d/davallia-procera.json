    "intro": "Davallia procera, commonly known as the resurrection fern, is a unique epiphytic fern that thrives on tree trunks and branches in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense, velvety clusters that cling to bark surfaces. The plant's leaves are leathery, dark green, and have a distinctive, fern-like structure with a feathery appearance. It is notable for its ability to survive extreme drought by curling its fronds into a compact, desiccated form. When moisture returns, it \"resurrects,\" unfurling its leaves and resuming photosynthesis."
