    "intro": "Draba ancashensis, commonly known as the Cash Valley whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Peruvian Andes. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as cabbages and mustards. This species is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers and basal rosette of leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Draba ancashensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
