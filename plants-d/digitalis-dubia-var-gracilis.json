    "intro": "Digitalis dubia var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender foxglove, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are typically purple or pink, with a distinctive spurred petal at the base. The plant produces a toxic cardiac glycoside called digitoxin, which makes it both a valuable medicinal plant and a potential hazard. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded woodland areas."
