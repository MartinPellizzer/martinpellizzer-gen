    "intro": "Delopyrum ciliatum, commonly known as the silky beardgrass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and delicate, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into dry, three-lobed fruits. Delopyrum ciliatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
