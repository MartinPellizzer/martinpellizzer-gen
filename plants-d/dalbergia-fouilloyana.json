    "intro": "Dalbergia fouilloyana, commonly known as the Cameroon rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its fruits are legumes that contain several flattened, elongated seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
