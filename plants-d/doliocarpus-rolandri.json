It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and mango trees, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically covered in a thick, waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, with conservation efforts underway to protect its natural environment."
