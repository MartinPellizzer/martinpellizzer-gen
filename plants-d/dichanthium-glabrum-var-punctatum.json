    "intro": "Dichanthium glabrum var. punctatum, commonly known as the punctate grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
