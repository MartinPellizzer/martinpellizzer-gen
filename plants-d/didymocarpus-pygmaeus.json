It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its compact size and fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically red or purple when mature, containing a single seed. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface. Due to its ornamental value and limited fruit size, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
