    "intro": "Dendrobium catillare, commonly known as the feathered orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant produces long, thin stems covered with numerous small, leaf-like structures called pseudobulbs. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Dendrobium catillare is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
