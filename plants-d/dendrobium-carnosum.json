    "intro": "Dendrobium carnosum, commonly known as the fat-lipped orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with a distinctive red lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and cultivated gardens."
