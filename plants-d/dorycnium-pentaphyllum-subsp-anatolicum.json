    "intro": "Dorycnium pentaphyllum subsp. anatolicum, commonly known as the Anatolian sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Turkey. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is valued as a forage plant and for soil enrichment."
