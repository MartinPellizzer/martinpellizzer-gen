It features dense clusters of rounded, silvery-gray leaves that resemble silver coins, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a versatile addition to both indoor and outdoor landscapes."
