    "intro": "Dactylorhiza kerryensis var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western Kerry orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the western regions of Ireland. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a single, erect stem topped with a dense cluster of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its roots are adapted to thrive in moist, acidic soils. It is listed as critically endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species."
