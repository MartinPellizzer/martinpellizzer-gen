    "intro": "Deutzia ferruginea, commonly known as rusty deutzia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has slender, arching branches and small, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its bark is grayish-brown and becomes flaky with age, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ease of care."
