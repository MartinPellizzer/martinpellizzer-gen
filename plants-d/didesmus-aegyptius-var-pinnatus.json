It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, feathery leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a low-growing habit. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
