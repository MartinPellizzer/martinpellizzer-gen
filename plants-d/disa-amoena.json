    "intro": "Disa amoena, commonly known as the pink disa, is a striking member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous regions, and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Disa amoena is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique beauty."
