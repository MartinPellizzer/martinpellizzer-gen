    "intro": "Distephanus swinglei, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, white, and often translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and specific soil conditions. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in many regions."
