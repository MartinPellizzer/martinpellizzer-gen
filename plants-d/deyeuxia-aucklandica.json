    "intro": "Deyeuxia aucklandica, commonly known as the Auckland grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, erect flowering stems that produce small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream margins, and coastal areas. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native invertebrates. Deyeuxia aucklandica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
