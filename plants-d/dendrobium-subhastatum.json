    "intro": "Dendrobium subhastatum, commonly known as the golden torch orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments with good air circulation. Its unique appearance and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for both horticultural and ornamental purposes."
