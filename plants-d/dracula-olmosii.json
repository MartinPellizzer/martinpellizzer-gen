    "intro": "Dracula olmosii, commonly known as the \"Dragon's Blood\" orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its dark red to purple flowers, which resemble a cascade of blood, giving it its dramatic common name. The plant has a unique rosette-like structure with elongated, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its humid, shaded habitat. Dracula olmosii thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the canopy of the rainforest. Its botanical significance lies in its ornamental value and its role in the biodiversity of its native ecosystem."
