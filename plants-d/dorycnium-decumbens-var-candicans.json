    "intro": "Dorycnium decumbens var. candicans, commonly known as the golden burr vetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by distinctive burrs that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
