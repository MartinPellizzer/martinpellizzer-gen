It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that form a dense, cascading structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are slender and often form a network that helps anchor the plant in soil.
