    "intro": "Deguelia oblonga, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often fuzzy or velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. The plant has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties and as a source of food."
