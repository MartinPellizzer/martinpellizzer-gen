Native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which resembles a coiled hood. The plant's foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. It requires well-draining soil and indirect light to flourish, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
