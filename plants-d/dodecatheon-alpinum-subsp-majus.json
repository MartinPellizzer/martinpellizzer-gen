    "intro": "Dodecatheon alpinum subsp. majus, commonly known as the Alpine Crownbeard, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence, which consists of a cluster of showy, bell-shaped flowers arranged in a crown-like pattern. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects."
