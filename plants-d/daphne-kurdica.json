    "intro": "Daphne kurdica, commonly known as Kurdish daphne, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features dense, evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces striking clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or lilac, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its flowers are followed by small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. Daphne kurdica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
