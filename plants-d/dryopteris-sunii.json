    "intro": "Dryopteris sunii, commonly known as the sun fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces fronds that are typically divided into pinnae with a distinctive, often curled appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its spores are released from fertile fronds, which develop in the late summer and early autumn. Dryopteris sunii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to add a lush, green texture to shaded landscapes."
