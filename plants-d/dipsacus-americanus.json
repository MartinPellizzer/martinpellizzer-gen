    "intro": "Dipsacus americanus, commonly known as American teasel, is a biennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the burdock family (Araliaceae) and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of spiky, purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, burs that form after flowering, which can adhere to animals and clothing. These burs have historically been used in textile processing and traditional medicine."
