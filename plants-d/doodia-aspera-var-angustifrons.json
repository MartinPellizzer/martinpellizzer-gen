    "intro": "Doodia aspera var. angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-fruited chain fern, is a variant of the chain fern family with distinctive botanical features. It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense, overlapping fronds that are usually dark green and lanceolate in shape. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. The narrow, pointed fronds of this variety contribute to its unique appearance and ecological niche."
