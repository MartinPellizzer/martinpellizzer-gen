    "intro": "Didymocarpus vulpinus, commonly known as the red sanders, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly India, and is characterized by its small, red, berry-like fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in cymes. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Didymocarpus vulpinus is considered a valuable and endangered species in its native habitat."
