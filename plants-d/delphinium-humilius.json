    "intro": "Delphinium humilius, commonly known as the dwarf larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces small, palmately lobed leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling as all parts of the plant are toxic."
