    "intro": "Dichapetalum micropetalum, commonly known as the small-petaled dichapetalum, is a rare and striking member of the Bignoniaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive two-lobed structure. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
