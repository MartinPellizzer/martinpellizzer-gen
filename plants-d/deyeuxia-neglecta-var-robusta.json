    "intro": "Deyeuxia neglecta var. robusta, commonly known as the robust marshgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy habitats in Asia. It typically grows in dense clumps, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground. Due to its adaptability, it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
