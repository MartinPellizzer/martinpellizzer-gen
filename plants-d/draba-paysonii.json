    "intro": "Draba paysonii, commonly known as Payson's whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, often before the leaves fully develop. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Draba paysonii is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions and is often found in areas with well-drained soil."
