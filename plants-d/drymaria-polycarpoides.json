    "intro": "Drymaria polycarpoides, commonly known as the silverweed or sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance and helping to reduce water loss in dry environments. Drymaria polycarpoides is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
