    "intro": "Deschampsia aurea, commonly known as golden hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and produces delicate, golden-yellow inflorescences. This plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil. Deschampsia aurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
