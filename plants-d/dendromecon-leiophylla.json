    "intro": "Dendromecon leiophylla, commonly known as the white globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the stems are often covered in a distinctive white, waxy coating. Dendromecon leiophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest."
