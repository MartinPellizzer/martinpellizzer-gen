    "intro": "Deschampsia chinensis, commonly known as hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Deschampsia chinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
