It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Madagascar, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, strap-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Dracaena nitida is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate watering."
