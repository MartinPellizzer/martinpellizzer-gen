    "intro": "Drosera elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It features slender, upright stems covered in sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sugary substance to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with the same adhesive secretions along their surfaces. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Drosera elongata is known for its ability to digest trapped prey, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils."
