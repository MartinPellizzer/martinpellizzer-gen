    "intro": "Desmodium macrodesmum, commonly known as large-veined desmodium, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with prominent veins and small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several elliptical seeds. It is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Desmodium macrodesmum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and as a forage crop."
