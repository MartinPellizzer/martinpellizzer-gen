    "intro": "Dryopteris patula, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving the plant a lush, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly used in horticulture for its hardy and attractive foliage."
