    "intro": "Desmodium pallidum, commonly known as the pale desmodium, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its seeds are typically enclosed in pods and dispersed by wind or animals. Desmodium pallidum is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
