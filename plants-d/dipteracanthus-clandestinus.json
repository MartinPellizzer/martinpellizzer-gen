    "intro": "Dipteracanthus clandestinus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring slender stems and small, pale green or white flowers that resemble leaves, making it difficult to spot in its natural habitat. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain winged seeds for dispersal. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Dipteracanthus clandestinus is considered a critically endangered species."
