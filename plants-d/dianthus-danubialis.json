    "intro": "Dianthus danubialis, commonly known as the Danube carnation, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and displays showy, double-layered flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of petals that resemble miniature carnations. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white fuzzy coating. Dianthus danubialis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
