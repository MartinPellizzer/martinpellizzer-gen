    "intro": "Draba lipskyi, commonly known as the Karakoram sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Draba lipskyi has basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its blooming period occurs in early summer, producing clusters of white or pale yellow flowers."
