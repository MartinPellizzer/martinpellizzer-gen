    "intro": "Dactylorhiza transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe, particularly found in wet meadows and bogs. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, pink or purple flowers. The plant has a complex root system with mycorrhizal associations that aid in nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Dactylorhiza transsilvanica is an indicator species for nutrient-poor, acidic habitats."
