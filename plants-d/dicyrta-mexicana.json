    "intro": "Dicyrta mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in the eastern Pacific Ocean. It belongs to the family Aeplysiidae and is characterized by its elongated, soft body and translucent appearance. The plant, or rather the animal, is notable for its ability to change color and its role in marine ecosystems. It feeds primarily on algae and is often found in shallow, rocky coastal areas. Dicyrta mexicana plays a significant role in nutrient cycling and serves as prey for various marine predators."
