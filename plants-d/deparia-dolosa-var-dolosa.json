    "intro": "Deparia dolosa var. dolosa, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Deparia. It is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. The fronds are often covered in a thin layer of mucilage, which helps in water retention and protection from pathogens."
