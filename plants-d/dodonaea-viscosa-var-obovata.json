It features slender, woody stems with small, opposite, obovate leaves that have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, bead-like fruits. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. The leaves and stems are used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
