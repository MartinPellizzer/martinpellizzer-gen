    "intro": "Duvernoia gigantophylla, commonly known as the giant fan-leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length, making it one of the largest cycads in the world. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a thick, fibrous layer. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like male inflorescence and a smaller, female cone that produces seeds. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Duvernoia gigantophylla is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
