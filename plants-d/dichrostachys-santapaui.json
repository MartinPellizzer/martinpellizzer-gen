    "intro": "Dichrostachys santapaui, commonly known as the purple-leaf stinkwood, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that turn reddish-purple in cooler temperatures. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. The wood of Dichrostachys santapaui is hard and heavy, historically used for construction and tool-making."
