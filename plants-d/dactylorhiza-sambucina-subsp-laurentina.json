    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sambucina subsp. laurentina, commonly known as the Laurentian marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe and North America. It typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and marshes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, which is a key feature for identification. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and tall, slender stems. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often listed as a protected species in many regions."
