It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its large, flat, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white spadices, which are typical of the arum family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
