    "intro": "Dryopteris grandis, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant features a thick, rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance, and they are covered in small, rounded scales. Dryopteris grandis is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
