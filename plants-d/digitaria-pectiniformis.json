    "intro": "Digitaria pectiniformis, commonly known as the woolly fingergrass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, finger-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry to moderately moist conditions. Digitaria pectiniformis is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its invasive growth potential."
