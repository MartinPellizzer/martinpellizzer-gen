    "intro": "Dimorphotheca scabra, commonly known as the roughleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant grows in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and rocky areas, and is often found in disturbed soils. Its scientific name reflects the two distinct forms of its leaves, which vary in shape and texture. Dimorphotheca scabra is a hardy species that is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens."
