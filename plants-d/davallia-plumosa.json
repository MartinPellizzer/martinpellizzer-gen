    "intro": "Davallia plumosa, commonly known as the feather fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, Africa, and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that resemble plumes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats. The spores are borne on the undersides of the fronds, which are covered in a fine, hairy layer that aids in spore dispersal."
