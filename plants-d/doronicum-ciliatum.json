    "intro": "Doronicum ciliatum, commonly known as the creeping coltsfoot, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and often prostrate. The plant produces clusters of yellow, daisy-like flowers with prominent white ray florets and yellow disc florets. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Doronicum ciliatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
