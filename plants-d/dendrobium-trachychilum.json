    "intro": "Dendrobium trachychilum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems that often grow horizontally along the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with a distinct golden hue, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium trachychilum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
