    "intro": "Dendrophthora guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees, primarily in the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and relies on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis to some extent. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its parasitic nature can weaken its host tree over time, making it an important factor in forest ecosystems. Dendrophthora guatemalensis is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests."
