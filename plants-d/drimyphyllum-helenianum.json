    "intro": "Drimyphyllum helenianum, commonly known as the Greek starflower, is a rare and endangered species native to Greece. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its star-shaped flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. It blooms in late spring, producing small, white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
