    "intro": "Dendrobium klossii, commonly known as the Kloss orchid, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of Indonesia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically yellow or green with red or purple markings, and they bloom in clusters. Dendrobium klossii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
