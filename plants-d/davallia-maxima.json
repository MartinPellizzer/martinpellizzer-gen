    "intro": "Davallia maxima, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, which is why it earned its common name. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually leathery and can grow quite large, often reaching lengths of up to two meters. Davallia maxima is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper humidity and light."
