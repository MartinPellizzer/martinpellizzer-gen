It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in coastal scrub habitats. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white, and it blooms from spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is protected in some areas."
