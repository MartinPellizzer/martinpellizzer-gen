    "intro": "Dactylorhiza umbrosa subsp. persica, commonly known as the Persian marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, pleated leaves and tall, erect stems that bear clusters of fragrant, pinkish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and damp woodlands. It has a complex root system with mycorrhizal associations that aid in nutrient uptake. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth form compared to the typical subspecies."
