    "intro": "Dendrobium josephinae, commonly known as Josephina's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its tropical environment. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns that attract pollinators. Dendrobium josephinae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
