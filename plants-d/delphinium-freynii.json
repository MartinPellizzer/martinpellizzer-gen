    "intro": "Delphinium freynii, commonly known as the Freyn's larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense, terminal clusters. Its leaves are palmately compound, with lance-shaped leaflets that are often hairy and have a distinctive serrated margin. Delphinium freynii is valued for its ornamental appeal but contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
