    "intro": "Dendrobium xanthomeson, commonly known as the golden-veined orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, wiry stems covered in dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Dendrobium xanthomeson is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
