    "intro": "Dalea polystachya, commonly known as the prairie milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the central and western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, legume-like pods that contain the seeds. Dalea polystachya is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
