    "intro": "Dryopteris uniformis, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a stout, creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, upright, and often arching growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are released from sori located on the undersides of the fertile fronds."
