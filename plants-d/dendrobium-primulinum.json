    "intro": "Dendrobium primulinum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. Dendrobium primulinum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
