    "intro": "Diplostephium pulchrum, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features erect, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, which contains latex, is a characteristic feature of the genus Diplostephium. This species is adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
