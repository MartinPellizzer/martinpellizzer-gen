    "intro": "Dryopteris sacrosancta, commonly known as the sacred fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant prefers cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their aesthetic appeal."
