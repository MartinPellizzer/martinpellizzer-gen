    "intro": "Dolichos palmatus, commonly known as the palmate dolichos, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia. It features palmately lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. Its roots are known to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. Dolichos palmatus is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
