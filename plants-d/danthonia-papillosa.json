    "intro": "Danthonia papillosa, commonly known as the silky danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as heathlands and grassy woodlands. Its leaves are often covered with short, soft hairs, giving it a silky texture. Danthonia papillosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native garden landscaping."
