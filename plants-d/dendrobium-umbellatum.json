    "intro": "Dendrobium umbellatum, commonly known as the orchid with clustered flowers, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a tall, cane-like stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces a dense cluster of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium umbellatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
