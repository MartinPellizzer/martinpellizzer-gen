    "intro": "Dryopteris submarginalis var. lagerheimii, commonly known as the Lagerheim's marginal shield fern, is a variant of the marginal shield fern native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features fronds with a distinctive marginal shield shape, which is a key identifying characteristic. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
