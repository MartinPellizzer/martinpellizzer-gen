It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant white flowers that give way to clustered, fleshy fruits with a segmented, bright red or yellow exterior. The fruit's interior contains a white, juicy pulp and numerous hard, stony seeds, typical of the drupe fruit type. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and the edible, aromatic fruit it yields."
