    "intro": "Deppeopsis tenuiflora, commonly known as the narrow-flowered deppeopsis, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, and the leaves are finely divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
