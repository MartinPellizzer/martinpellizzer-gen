It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically borne on long, slender peduncles. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland tropical forests. The leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a food source for certain animals."
