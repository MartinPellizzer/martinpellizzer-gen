    "intro": "Deyeuxia nana, commonly known as dwarf sedge, is a low-growing grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, cushion-like clumps and has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are arranged in spikelets along its stem. Deyeuxia nana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its compact growth habit and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
