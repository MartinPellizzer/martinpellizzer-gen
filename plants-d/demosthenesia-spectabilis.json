    "intro": "Demosthenesia spectabilis, commonly known as the splendid demosthenes, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue petals that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
