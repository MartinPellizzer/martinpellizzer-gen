    "intro": "Dysophylla benthamiana var. hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan dysophylla, is a rare flowering plant native to the southern Chinese province of Hainan. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded, moist forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endemic species with conservation concerns."
