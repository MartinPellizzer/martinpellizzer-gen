It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust growth habit. The plant features a thick, fleshy stem with waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
