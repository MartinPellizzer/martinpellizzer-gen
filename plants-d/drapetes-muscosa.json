    "intro": "Drapetes muscosa, commonly known as the mossy drapetis, is a rare and delicate member of the Drapetis genus. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with dense, moss-like foliage that helps it blend into its surroundings. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often pale green or white, and are clustered in loose inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Drapetes muscosa is considered a rare and endangered species."
