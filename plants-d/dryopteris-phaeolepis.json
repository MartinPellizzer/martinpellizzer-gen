    "intro": "Dryopteris phaeolepis, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are typically upright and narrow. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The black fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and its ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions."
