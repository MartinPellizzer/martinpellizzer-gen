    "intro": "Deverra triradiata subsp. musilii, commonly known as the Desert Caper, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, green, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, facilitating dispersal. The species is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
