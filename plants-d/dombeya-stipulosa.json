    "intro": "Dombeya stipulosa, commonly known as the white dombeya, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain several seeds. Dombeya stipulosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
