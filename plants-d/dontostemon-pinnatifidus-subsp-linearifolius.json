    "intro": "Dontostemon pinnatifidus subsp. linearifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pinnatifid dandelion, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single, terminal head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are pinnatifid, meaning they are deeply lobed or cut into narrow segments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas."
