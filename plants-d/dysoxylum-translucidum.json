    "intro": "Dysoxylum translucidum, commonly known as the translucent wood tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its unique translucent leaves that allow light to pass through. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are elliptical and have a waxy surface, which contributes to their translucent appearance. The flowers are small and clustered, producing fragrant blooms that attract pollinators."
