    "intro": "Diplazium nervosum, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has long, slender fronds that are often submerged or floating, with a delicate, lacy appearance. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic life. Diplazium nervosum is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in wetland ecosystems."
