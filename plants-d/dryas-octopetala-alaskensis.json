    "intro": "Dryas octopetala alaskensis, commonly known as the Alaskan mountain avens, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it withstand harsh cold and wind. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine tundra and arctic heath habitats. Due to its hardiness, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife."
