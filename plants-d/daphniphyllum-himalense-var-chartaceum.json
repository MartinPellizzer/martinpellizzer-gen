    "intro": "Daphniphyllum himalense var. chartaceum, commonly known as the Himalayan paperleaf daphniphyllum, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often chartaceous (paper-like) leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are usually white or pale pink, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in shaded forest environments. This variant is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
