    "intro": "Danthonia lepidopoda, commonly known as the silky danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its fine, silky-textured leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in low nutrient soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are usually pale green to brown in color. Danthonia lepidopoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
