    "intro": "Diplazium atirrense var. lobulatum, commonly known as the lobed water fern, is a variant of the Diplazium genus native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its fronds that are divided into lobes, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are typically dark green and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions."
