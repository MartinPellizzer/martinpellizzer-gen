    "intro": "Dryopteris cyclosorus, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its sori, which contain the spores, are arranged in a unique circular pattern on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris cyclosorus prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
