    "intro": "Damasonium maximum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water clover, is a herbaceous aquatic plant characterized by its floating leaves and root system. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has oval, waxy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators like bees. Damasonium maximum plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic organisms."
