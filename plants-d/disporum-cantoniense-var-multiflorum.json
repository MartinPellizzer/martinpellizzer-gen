    "intro": "Disporum cantoniense var. multiflorum, commonly known as the Chinese threadleaf, is a flowering plant native to southeastern China. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a notable species in its native habitat. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and moths."
