    "intro": "Damasonium stellatum var. compactum, commonly known as the compact water starwort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant features a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that are often submerged, with small, white flowers that bloom in summer. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for pond landscaping and water garden decoration. It is also valued for its ability to help stabilize sediment and improve water quality in aquatic ecosystems."
