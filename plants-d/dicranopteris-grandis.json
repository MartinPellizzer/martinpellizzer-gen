    "intro": "Dicranopteris grandis, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dicranopteris grandis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
