It typically forms dense mats on the ground, often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The plant has narrow, flat leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions and is often used in erosion control. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
