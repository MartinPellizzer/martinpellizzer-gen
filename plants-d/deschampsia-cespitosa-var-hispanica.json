    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa var. hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, tufted clumps. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering stems bear panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form attractive, low-maintenance turf."
