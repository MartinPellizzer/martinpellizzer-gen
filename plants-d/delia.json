    "intro": "Delia, commonly known as the cabbage fly, is a small, delicate insect that is not a plant but a pest affecting Brassica crops. While not a botanical subject itself, it is often confused with the Delia genus of flowering plants. The Delia genus includes several species of flowering plants, such as Delia carota, which is a type of flowering plant native to Europe. These plants typically have small, clustered flowers and are often found in grassy areas. They are not commonly cultivated but are of interest in botanical studies due to their unique floral structures."
