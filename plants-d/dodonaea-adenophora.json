    "intro": "Dodonaea adenophora, commonly known as the velvetleaf dodonaea, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in non-native environments."
