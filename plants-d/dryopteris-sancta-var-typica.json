    "intro": "Dryopteris sancta var. typica, commonly known as the sacred fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to establish strong root systems in rocky or clay soils. The fronds are known for their ornamental value and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their aesthetic appeal."
