    "intro": "Dendropemon picardae, commonly known as the Picard's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery\u7ed2\u6bdb, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Dendropemon picardae is considered an endangered species."
