    "intro": "Dryopteris blanfordii subsp. nigrosquamosa, commonly known as the black-squamate wood fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically dark green with a rough, scaly texture on the underside. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a dense appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. This fern is notable for its drought tolerance and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
