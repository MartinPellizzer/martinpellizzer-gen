    "intro": "Dracula tobarii, commonly known as the \"bat plant,\" is a rare and unique epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, dark red or purple flowers that resemble the wings of a bat, hence its common name. The plant has a short, thick stem with a single, elongated leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of moss-like growth. Dracula tobarii thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, typically growing on trees in the understory of dense rainforests. Its botanical significance lies in its distinctive morphology and its role as an indicator species for cloud forest ecosystems."
