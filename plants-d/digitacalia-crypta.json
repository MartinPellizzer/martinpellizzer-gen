    "intro": "Digitacalia crypta, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Digitacalia crypta is considered endangered."
