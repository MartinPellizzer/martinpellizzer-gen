    "intro": "Dieteria bigelovii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Dieteria bigelovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh desert conditions."
