It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are opposite or clustered at the base of the shoots. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, orange-red berries. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a distinctive aromatic scent.
