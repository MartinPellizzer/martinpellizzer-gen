It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and alpine landscapes."
