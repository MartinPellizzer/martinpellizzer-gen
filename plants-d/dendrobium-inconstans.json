    "intro": "Dendrobium inconstans, commonly known as the variable orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. Dendrobium inconstans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated for its unique floral display."
