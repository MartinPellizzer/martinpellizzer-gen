    "intro": "Duguetia aberrans, commonly known as the red-flowered tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its showy, tubular red flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often gland-dotted. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright color and nectar-rich structure. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
