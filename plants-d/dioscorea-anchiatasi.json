    "intro": "Dioscorea anchiatasi, commonly known as the anchiatasi yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, green flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. The tubers are often harvested for their starchy content and have been traditionally used in local cuisines and herbal remedies."
