It is characterized by its long, branching fronds that are often feather-like in appearance. This seaweed thrives in intertidal and subtidal zones, typically in areas with moderate to strong water movement. The plant's structure consists of a holdfast, stipe, and blade, with the blade being the most prominent feature. It plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
