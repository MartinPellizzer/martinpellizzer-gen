    "intro": "Dicymbe uaiparuensis, commonly known as the Brazilian burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique, compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pods that contain hard, seed-like structures, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its ecological role includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
