It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for medicinal and culinary purposes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Its leaves are heart-shaped and can grow quite large, while its flowers are typically small and greenish-white in color. The tubers of Dioscorea amazonum contain compounds that have been traditionally used in indigenous medicine for their potential health benefits."
