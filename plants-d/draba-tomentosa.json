    "intro": "Draba tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in a thick layer of fine, woolly hairs. Draba tomentosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in mountainous and tundra regions."
