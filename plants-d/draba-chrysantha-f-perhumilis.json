    "intro": "Draba chrysantha f. perhumilis, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Its small, rounded leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather conditions. This subspecies is often found in mountainous regions across Europe and parts of Asia."
