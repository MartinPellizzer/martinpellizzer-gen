    "intro": "Dalbergia martini, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with pairs of oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
