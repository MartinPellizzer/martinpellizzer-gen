    "intro": "Dendrobium daenikerianum, commonly known as the Daeniker's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are covered in clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its blossoms are typically yellow or greenish-yellow with purple or red markings, and they bloom during the dry season. Dendrobium daenikerianum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
