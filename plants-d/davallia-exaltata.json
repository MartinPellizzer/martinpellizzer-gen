    "intro": "Davallia exaltata, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a terrestrial fern characterized by its unique, umbrella-like fronds that resemble a bird's nest. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically leathery and dark green, with a distinctive curled appearance that provides structural support and aids in water retention. Davallia exaltata is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to indoor conditions."
