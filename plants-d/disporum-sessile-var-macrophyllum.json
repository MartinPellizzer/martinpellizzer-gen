    "intro": "Disporum sessile var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf False Lily of the Valley, is a variant of the Disporum sessile species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that can reach up to 10 inches in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is notable for its larger foliage compared to the typical form of Disporum sessile."
