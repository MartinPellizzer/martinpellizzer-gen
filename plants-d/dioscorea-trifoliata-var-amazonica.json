    "intro": "Dioscorea trifoliata var. amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian yam or wild yam, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its tuberous roots that are used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by yellow berries that contain toxic seeds. Its tubers are rich in diosgenin, a compound used in the synthesis of hormonal medications. Due to its medicinal properties and ecological role, it is an important species in its native habitat."
