    "intro": "Dorstenia barnimiana var. telekii, commonly known as the \"Cushion Fig,\" is a unique and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, forming a rounded, cushion-like structure that resembles a small shrub. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid native environment. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or yellow, and are borne in clusters near the base of the plant. This species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in well-drained soil and bright, indirect light."
