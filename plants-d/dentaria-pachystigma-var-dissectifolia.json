    "intro": "Dentaria pachystigma var. dissectifolia, commonly known as the dissected toothache plant, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that resemble a dissected leaf blade. The plant produces small, yellow, cruciform flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is notable for containing compounds that have been historically used in traditional medicine. The varietal name \"dissectifolia\" refers to its finely divided foliage, which is a key identifying feature."
