    "intro": "Dryopsis nidus, commonly known as the bird's nest orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, cup-like structure formed by its leaves, which resembles a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern on the petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
