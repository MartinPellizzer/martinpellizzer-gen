    "intro": "Desmazeria marina, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in salt marshes and dunes. It is well adapted to saline environments, with specialized structures that help it retain moisture. Desmazeria marina plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
