    "intro": "Dendrochilum wenzelii, commonly known as the Wenzel's tree orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water and nutrients. Dendrochilum wenzelii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
