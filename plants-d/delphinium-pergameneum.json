    "intro": "Delphinium pergameneum, commonly known as the Peruvian larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which are typically arranged in racemes. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is toxic to livestock and humans."
