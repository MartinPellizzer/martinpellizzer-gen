    "intro": "Digitaria distachyos, commonly known as green panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-branched flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in erosion control due to its rapid growth and extensive root system. Digitaria distachyos is also cultivated as a forage crop in some parts of the world."
