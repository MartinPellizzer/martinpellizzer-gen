    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis var. rubiginosa, commonly known as the rusty wood fern, is a perennial fern native to North America. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that develop a reddish-brown margin, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
