    "intro": "Dalbergia glabra, commonly known as Indian rosewood, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The tree produces hard, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can grow up to 20 meters in height. Due to its slow growth and high demand, it is considered a threatened species in many parts of its range."
