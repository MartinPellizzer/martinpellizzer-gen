It features tall, spire-like flower clusters that bloom in shades of white and pink, with distinctive spots on the petals. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a velvety texture, while the plant produces a toxic cardiac glycoside called digitoxin. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental value. This variety is also valued for its historical use in medicine and its role in attracting pollinators."
