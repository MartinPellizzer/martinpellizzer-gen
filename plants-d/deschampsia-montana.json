    "intro": "Deschampsia montana, commonly known as mountain feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, rocky slopes, and alpine areas. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green coloration that becomes more pronounced in cooler climates. It produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate ornamental quality to its appearance."
