    "intro": "Dioicodendron, commonly known as the whitebeard tree, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its dioecious nature, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate plants. The leaves are typically alternate and simple, often with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. This plant is native to parts of Africa and is often found in dry, open habitats."
