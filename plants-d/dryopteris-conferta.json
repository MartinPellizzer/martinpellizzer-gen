    "intro": "Dryopteris conferta, commonly known as the evergreen wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, intricate pattern of pinnae and pinnules that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
