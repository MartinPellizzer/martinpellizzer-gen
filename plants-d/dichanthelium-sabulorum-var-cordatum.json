    "intro": "Dichanthelium sabulorum var. cordatum, commonly known as the cordate dichanthelium, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils, often in open habitats such as prairies or dunes. It has a low-growing habit with rhizomes that help it spread and establish in disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities in its range."
