It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce fragrant, silky seeds. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Dichanthium odoratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional crafts and as a source of aromatic materials."
