    "intro": "Daucus carota var. violaceus, commonly known as purple carrot, is a variant of the wild carrot species characterized by its striking violet or purple root color. This plant belongs to the Apiaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. The leaves are finely divided, resembling those of its wild relatives, and the flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels. While not as commonly cultivated as the orange carrot, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild, sweet flavor. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to both gardens and botanical collections."
