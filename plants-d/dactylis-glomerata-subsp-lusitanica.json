    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata subsp. lusitanica, commonly known as Portuguese couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces edible seeds that are utilized in some traditional contexts. The subspecies is notable for its adaptability and resilience, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
