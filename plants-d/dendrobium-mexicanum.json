    "intro": "Dendrobium mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It features long, wiry stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often adorned with clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in the spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium mexicanum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in both greenhouse and outdoor settings."
