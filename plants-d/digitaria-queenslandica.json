    "intro": "Digitaria queenslandica, commonly known as Queensland grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Queensland grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and restoration projects."
