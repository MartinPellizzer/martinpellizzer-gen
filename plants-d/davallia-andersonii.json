    "intro": "Davallia andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's hartiocaudata, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant produces small, dark brown sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are typically clustered in groups called sori. It thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
