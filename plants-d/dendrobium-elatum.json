    "intro": "Dendrobium elatum, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a tall, branched stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height, often adorned with numerous showy flowers. The plant produces large, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain. Dendrobium elatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
