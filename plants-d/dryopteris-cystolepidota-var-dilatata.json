    "intro": "Dryopteris cystolepidota var. dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus characterized by its large, broad, and often deeply lobed fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year, producing spores on the underside. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time. Its prehistoric appearance and ecological adaptability make it a notable species in both botanical studies and natural landscapes."
