    "intro": "Dryopteris scabripes, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are covered with a distinctive, rough texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant plays an important role in forest ecosystems."
