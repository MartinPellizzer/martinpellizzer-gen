    "intro": "Dendrobium jamesianum, commonly known as the James' orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Its pseudobulbs are thick and segmented, storing water and nutrients. Dendrobium jamesianum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
