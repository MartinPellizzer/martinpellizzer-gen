    "intro": "Digitaria saltensis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense, compact growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it highly drought-tolerant. Digitaria saltensis is often found in saline soils and is an important component of stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion."
