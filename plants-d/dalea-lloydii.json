    "intro": "Dalea lloydii, commonly known as Lloyd's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Dalea lloydii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
