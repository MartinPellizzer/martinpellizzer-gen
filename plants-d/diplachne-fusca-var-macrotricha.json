    "intro": "Diplachne fusca var. macrotricha, commonly known as broadleaf grass or broadleaf buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and forms dense, low-growing turf. The plant has narrow, flat, bluish-green leaves with a prominent midrib, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in pairs. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for erosion control. The variety macrotricha is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Diplachne fusca."
