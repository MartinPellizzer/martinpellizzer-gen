It is a trailing or climbing vine characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The flowers are typically bright yellow or orange, with five lobes, and bloom throughout the growing season. This variety is notable for its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other Dipladenia species. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and containers."
