    "intro": "Diplazium coriaceum, commonly known as the tough fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often covered in a thick cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist habitats such as forests or rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas. The fronds are usually divided into pinnae with a serrated or toothed margin, adding to its distinctive appearance."
