    "intro": "Diplazium squamigerum, commonly known as the scaly shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a perennial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth and fronds that are typically divided into pinnate segments. The fronds are covered with small, scale-like structures, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
