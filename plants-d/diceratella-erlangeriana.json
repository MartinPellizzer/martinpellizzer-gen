It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Diceratella erlangeriana is also known for its ability to store water in its thick stems, making it well adapted to drought conditions."
