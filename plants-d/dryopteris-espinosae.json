    "intro": "Dryopteris espinosae, commonly known as the Espinosa's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a distinctive dark green color and a finely divided, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests and along rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a linear pattern. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
