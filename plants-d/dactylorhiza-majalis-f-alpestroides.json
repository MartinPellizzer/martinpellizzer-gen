    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis f. alpestroides, commonly known as the alpine marsh orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and marshes, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
