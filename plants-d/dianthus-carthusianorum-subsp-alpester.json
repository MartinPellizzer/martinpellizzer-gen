    "intro": "Dianthus carthusianorum subsp. alpester, commonly known as the alpine carnation, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant produces small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its harsh, high-altitude environment. Its flowers are composed of five petals that are often marked with dark veins, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This subspecies is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky soils and mountainous areas."
