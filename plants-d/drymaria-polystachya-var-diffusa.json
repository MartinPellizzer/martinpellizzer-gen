    "intro": "Drymaria polystachya var. diffusa, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
