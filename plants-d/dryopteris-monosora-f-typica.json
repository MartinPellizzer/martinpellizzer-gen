    "intro": "Dryopteris monosora f. typica, commonly known as the typical form of the Japanese shield fern, is a fern species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in temperate regions."
