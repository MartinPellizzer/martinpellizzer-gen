    "intro": "Disanthus cercidifolius, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, typically in shades of red or pink, which are followed by winged seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Disanthus cercidifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
