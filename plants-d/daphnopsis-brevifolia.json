    "intro": "Daphnopsis brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved daphnopsis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
