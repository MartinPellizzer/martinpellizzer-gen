    "intro": "Dendrotrophe spicata, commonly known as the spike-haired tree fern, is a unique plant with a distinctive appearance. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, spiky fronds that give it its common name. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. Its fronds are arranged in a tight, spiky cluster at the top, which helps in capturing moisture from the air. Dendrotrophe spicata is often found in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
