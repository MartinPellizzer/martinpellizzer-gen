It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, white, spherical inflorescences that resemble snowballs, which appear during the dry season. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic with a slightly waxy texture. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.
