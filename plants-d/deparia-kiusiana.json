    "intro": "Deparia kiusiana, commonly known as the Kiusi water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense, green mat on the water surface. Its rhizomes anchor it to the substrate while supporting the growth of new fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, delicate pinnae that help in photosynthesis and oxygenation of the water."
