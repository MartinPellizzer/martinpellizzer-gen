    "intro": "Discocactus silvaticus, commonly known as the forest discocactus, is a species of cactus native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its short, thick stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season, adding a vibrant touch to its dense foliage. Despite its cactus classification, it thrives in humid, shaded environments rather than arid deserts. Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in the competitive understory of tropical forests."
