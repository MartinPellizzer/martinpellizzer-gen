    "intro": "Dendrobium stellare, commonly known as the star orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive red or pink throat. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium stellare thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity."
