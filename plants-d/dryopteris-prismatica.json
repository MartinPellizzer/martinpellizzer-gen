    "intro": "Dryopteris prismatica, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive prismatic appearance due to their finely divided, silvery-white veins. It prefers well-drained, acidic soil and can be grown in containers or as a ground cover in woodland gardens. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
