    "intro": "Dryopteris repandula, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, serrated edge. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Dryopteris repandula is a perennial plant that can grow up to 3 feet tall, making it a notable presence in its natural habitat."
