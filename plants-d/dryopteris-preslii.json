    "intro": "Dryopteris preslii, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
