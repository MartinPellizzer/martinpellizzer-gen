    "intro": "Digitaria tenuiflora, commonly known as slender false brome, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Digitaria tenuiflora is often found in dry, sunny environments and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
