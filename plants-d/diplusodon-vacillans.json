    "intro": "Diplusodon vacillans, commonly known as the wavy-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that often exhibit a wavy or undulating pattern along their margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing soruses located on the underside of its fronds. Diplusodon vacillans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
