This plant is a variant of the aster species, characterized by its glandular structures on the leaves and stems. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. The leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough texture due to the presence of glands. It produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of purple or white, which bloom in the late summer and early autumn."
