    "intro": "Dudleya saxosa subsp. aloides, commonly known as the coastal Dudleya, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and coastal environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
