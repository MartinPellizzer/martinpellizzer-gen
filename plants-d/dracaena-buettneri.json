    "intro": "Dracaena buettneri, commonly known as the dragon tree, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features tall, slender stems with dark green, strap-like leaves that have a glossy sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena buettneri is popular in indoor gardening for its air-purifying qualities and elegant appearance."
