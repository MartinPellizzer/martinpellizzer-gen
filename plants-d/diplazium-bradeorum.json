    "intro": "Diplazium bradeorum, commonly known as the Brade's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in anchoring the plant in the substrate. Diplazium bradeorum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
