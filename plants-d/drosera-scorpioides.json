    "intro": "Drosera scorpioides, commonly known as the spiral sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant's leaves are typically red or orange in color, which helps attract prey. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Drosera scorpioides is known for its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name."
