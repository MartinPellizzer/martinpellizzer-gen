    "intro": "Dryopteris baileyi, commonly known as the Bailey's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure that gives the plant its elegant appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently."
