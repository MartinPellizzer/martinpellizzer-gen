    "intro": "Discocactus heptacanthus subsp. goiasensis, commonly known as the Goi\u00e1s discocactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the dry season, which are clustered at the base of the stem. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and minimal water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
