    "intro": "Doxanthes, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are native to coastal regions of the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical climates. They are characterized by their showy, hibiscus-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are succulent and often woody. Doxanthes species are well adapted to saline environments, making them resilient to coastal conditions and salt spray."
