    "intro": "Delphinium stenocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-capsule larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers with five petals, typical of the Delphinium genus. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens."
