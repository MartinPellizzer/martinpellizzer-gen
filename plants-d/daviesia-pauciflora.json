    "intro": "Daviesia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered daviesia, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in heathland or open woodland environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually yellow or cream in color, appearing in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Daviesia pauciflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
