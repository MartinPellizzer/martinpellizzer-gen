    "intro": "Digitalis dubia f. mollis, commonly known as the soft-leaved foxglove, is a rare and attractive variant of the foxglove genus. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves and striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. It is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and delicate nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
