    "intro": "Dendrobium lohanense, commonly known as the Lohan orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in summer, producing white or pale yellow blossoms with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated for horticultural purposes but is also threatened by habitat loss."
