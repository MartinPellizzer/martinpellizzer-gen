    "intro": "Draba alpina var. pohlei, commonly known as the alpine draba, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. It has a short growing season and relies on early snowmelt for germination and growth. Its small size and hardy nature make it a characteristic component of alpine flora."
