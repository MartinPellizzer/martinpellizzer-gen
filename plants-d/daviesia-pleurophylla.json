    "intro": "Daviesia pleurophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed broom, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or loamy soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces yellow or orange flowers in late spring to early summer. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Daviesia pleurophylla is often used in ecological restoration due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soils."
