    "intro": "Diplazium biolleyi, commonly known as the Boll\u00e9's sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually, forming dense mats that contribute to soil stabilization. Diplazium biolleyi is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
