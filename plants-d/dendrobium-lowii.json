    "intro": "Dendrobium lowii, commonly known as the White Wandering Orchid, is a type of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Dendrobium lowii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beauty and resilience."
