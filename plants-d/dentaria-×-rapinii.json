    "intro": "Dentaria \u00d7 rapinii, commonly known as the hybrid toothworts, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, tooth-like leaves that are deeply lobed and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, hairy stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and is often found in rich, well-drained soils. Due to its hybrid nature, Dentaria \u00d7 rapinii exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
