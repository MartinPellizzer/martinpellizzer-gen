    "intro": "Dryopteris aitoniana, commonly known as the Aiton's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a distinctive, deeply lobed shape. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The leaves are dark green and maintain their color year-round, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
