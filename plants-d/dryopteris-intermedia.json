    "intro": "Dryopteris intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright, branching fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like appearance."
