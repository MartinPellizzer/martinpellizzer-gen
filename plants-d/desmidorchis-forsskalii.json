It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils in desert ecosystems."
