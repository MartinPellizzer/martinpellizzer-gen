    "intro": "Dactylorhiza ruthei subsp. osiliensis, commonly known as the Osiliensis marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in wet, peaty or muddy habitats, often in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. The plant has a slender, upright stem with few leaves and produces clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its specialized mycorrhizal associations that aid in nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
