It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, serrated pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appearance.
