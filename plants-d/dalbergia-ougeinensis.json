    "intro": "Dalbergia ougeinensis, commonly known as the Bhutanese rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayan regions of Bhutan and northeastern India. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces hard, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in several conservation programs."
