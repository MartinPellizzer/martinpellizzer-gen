    "intro": "Delphinium pseudocampylocentrum var. glabripes, commonly known as the glabrous delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces clusters of striking blue to purple flowers, which are typically arranged in dense spikes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, though the variety 'glabripes' is distinguished by its smooth, hairless foliage. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
