It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome and produces tall, branched stems bearing numerous showy, violet to purple flowers. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitats."
