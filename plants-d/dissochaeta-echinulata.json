    "intro": "Dissochaeta echinulata, commonly known as the spiny hairgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are typically green or pale in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of tiny, stiff hairs. Dissochaeta echinulata is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and sandy soils."
