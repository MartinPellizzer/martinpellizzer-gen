    "intro": "Dianella revoluta var. brevicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flax lily, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and form a dense, rounded clump. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late winter to early spring, which are borne on short, upright stems. It is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and salt resistance. The varietal form brevicaulis distinguishes it by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical variety."
