    "intro": "Dermatophyllum gypsophilum, commonly known as the gypsum daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are typically blue-gray in color, covered in a fine layer of hairs that help reduce water loss. The species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
