    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 litardierei, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carthusiana and Dryopteris pentaphylla. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a dark green, leathery texture and a distinctive, linear shape. The plant produces large, fertile spore clusters on the underside of its fronds, typically in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections for its striking appearance."
