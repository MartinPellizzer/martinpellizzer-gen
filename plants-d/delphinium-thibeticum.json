    "intro": "Delphinium thibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking, spurred petals that attract pollinators. Its leaves are compound, with elongated, serrated leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its habitat in high-altitude regions, it is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, arid conditions."
