    "intro": "Daucus communis var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate carrot, is a wild plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and a slender, often branched stem. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This variety is considered a close relative of the cultivated carrot and has been used in botanical studies for its genetic diversity."
