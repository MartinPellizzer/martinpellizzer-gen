    "intro": "Deyeuxia suizanensis var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf variant of the Suizan grass, is a perennial grass species native to specific regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
