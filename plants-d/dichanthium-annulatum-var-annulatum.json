It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
