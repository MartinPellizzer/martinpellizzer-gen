    "intro": "Daucus herculeus, commonly known as giant parsley, is a biennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, fern-like leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, which are typical of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds are small and white, often used as a spice in traditional cuisines. Due to its rapid growth and invasive nature, it is considered a weed in many areas where it is not native."
