    "intro": "Deyeuxia neglecta var. aculeolata, commonly known as the prickly flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are often covered with fine, hair-like structures that give it a rough texture. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its more pronounced, sharp-tipped leaves and a more robust growth habit."
