    "intro": "Drosera \u00d7 eloisiana, commonly known as the hybrid sundew, is a carnivorous plant that combines traits from its parent species, Drosera binata and Drosera elios. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden mucilage to trap and digest insects. This hybrid is typically found in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped and can vary in color from green to reddish depending on light exposure. Drosera \u00d7 eloisiana is valued by carnivorous plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and ease of cultivation."
