    "intro": "Diastema exiguum var. lilacinum, commonly known as the lilac-flowered diastema, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale lilac to deep purple. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral displays. This variety is notable for its unique fragrance, which is often described as subtly sweet and spicy. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
