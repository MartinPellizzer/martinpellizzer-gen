    "intro": "Dryopteris tuberculata, commonly known as the curled shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, curling fronds that unfurl into a fan-like shape as they mature. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The fronds are covered in small, rounded tubercles, giving the plant its common name and contributing to its ornamental appeal."
