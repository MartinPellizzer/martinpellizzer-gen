    "intro": "Digitaria arenicola, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat. Digitaria arenicola is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, dunes, and coastal areas."
