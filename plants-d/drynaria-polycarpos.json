    "intro": "Drynaria polycarpos, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hardy, leathery fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in rocky, shaded environments and is well adapted to arid conditions. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which release spores for reproduction. Its unique morphology and resilience make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
