    "intro": "Desmodium retusum var. amoenum, commonly known as the velvet bean or velvetleaf, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces pods containing small, edible seeds that are rich in protein and often used as a food source. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. Additionally, it has nitrogen-fixing capabilities, which can benefit soil fertility."
