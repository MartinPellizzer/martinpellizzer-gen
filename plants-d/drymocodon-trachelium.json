    "intro": "Drymocodon trachelium, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its succulent foliage helps it retain moisture in harsh, high-altitude environments. Drymocodon trachelium is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid conditions."
