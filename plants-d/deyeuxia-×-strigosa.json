    "intro": "Deyeuxia \u00d7 strigosa, commonly known as the hybrid tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in association with other wetland grasses. Deyeuxia \u00d7 strigosa is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
