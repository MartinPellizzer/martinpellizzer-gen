    "intro": "Dalea boraginea, commonly known as the blue milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Dalea boraginea plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
