It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and the production of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to southern Africa and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Dicodon species are typically drought-tolerant and thrive in well-drained soils. They are also known for their ability to propagate through offsets, making them easy to grow in gardens and indoor settings."
