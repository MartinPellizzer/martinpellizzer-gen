    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudofilix-mas, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically lance-shaped and have a dense arrangement of small, rounded sori on the underside. The plant is native to temperate regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The fronds are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
