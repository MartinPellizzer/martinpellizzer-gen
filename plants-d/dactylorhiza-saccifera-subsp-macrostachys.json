    "intro": "Dactylorhiza saccifera subsp. macrostachys, commonly known as the broad-stalked marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often in shaded environments. The plant features a stout rhizome with a saccate base, and its leaves are grass-like, arranged in a rosette. It produces tall, branching inflorescences with pale purple or greenish flowers that have a distinctive three-lobed lip. This subspecies is noted for its ecological importance in wetland ecosystems and is often found in association with other orchid species."
