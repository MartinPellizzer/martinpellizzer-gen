    "intro": "Dryopteris inaensis, commonly known as the Ina Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically arching and finely divided. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are typically borne on short, upright stalks."
