    "intro": "Diplocardia, commonly known as the \"cabbage tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the spring. The plants are native to southern Africa and are often found in rocky or arid environments. They have a compact growth habit and are valued for their ornamental appeal. Diplocardia species are generally drought-tolerant and require well-drained soil to thrive."
