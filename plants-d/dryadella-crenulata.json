    "intro": "Dryadella crenulata, commonly known as the smoothleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It features a dense, leathery thallus with a smooth, greenish to yellowish upper surface. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which provides it with nutrients. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health."
