    "intro": "Danthonia alpicola, commonly known as the alpine danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its specialized habitat, Danthonia alpicola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
