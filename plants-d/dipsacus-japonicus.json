    "intro": "Dipsacus japonicus, commonly known as Japanese teasel, is a perennial plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. Dipsacus japonicus is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along roadsides."
