    "intro": "Dionysia zagrica, commonly known as the Zagreb dionysia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Dionysia zagrica is considered a species of conservation concern."
