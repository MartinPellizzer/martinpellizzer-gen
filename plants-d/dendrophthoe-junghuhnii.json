    "intro": "Dendrophthoe junghuhnii, commonly known as the red root or Indian milkweed, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying on its host plant for essential nutrients. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, attaching itself to various host trees such as figs and eucalyptus. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or red, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Dendrophthoe junghuhnii is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested areas where its host trees are abundant."
