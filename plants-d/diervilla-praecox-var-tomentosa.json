    "intro": "Diervilla praecox var. tomentosa, commonly known as the silverleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its foliage covered in a fine, silvery-gray pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically white or pale yellow. Its berries are red or orange and appear in late summer, providing food for birds. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in shaded to partially sunny conditions."
