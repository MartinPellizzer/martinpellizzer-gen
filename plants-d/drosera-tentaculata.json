    "intro": "Drosera tentaculata, commonly known as the tentacle sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its small, white flowers bloom in summer, and it produces a unique seed capsule that disperses its seeds via wind. Drosera tentaculata is a hardy species that can survive in various conditions, making it a popular choice for carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
