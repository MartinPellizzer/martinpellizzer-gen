    "intro": "Dactylorhiza lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces a single, tall stem with a few leaves and a single, showy flower that is usually pink or purple in color. It blooms in late spring to early summer and is often found in heathlands and bogs. Dactylorhiza lapponica is adapted to cold climates and has a long dormancy period during the winter months."
