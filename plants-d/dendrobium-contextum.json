    "intro": "Dendrobium contextum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, branching stem system with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern along the stems. Dendrobium contextum thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
