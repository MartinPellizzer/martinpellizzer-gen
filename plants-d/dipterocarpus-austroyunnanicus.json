    "intro": "Dipterocarpus austroyunnanicus, commonly known as the Yunnan dipterocarp, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its large, often buttressed roots and broad, ovate leaves. The tree produces heavy, woody fruits that contain winged seeds, typical of many dipterocarps. It thrives in humid, lowland forests and plays a significant role in the ecological structure of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
