    "intro": "Dockrillia delicata, commonly known as the delicate dockrillia, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific microhabitats. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. It produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dockrillia delicata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
