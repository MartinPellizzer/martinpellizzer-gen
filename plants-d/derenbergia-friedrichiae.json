    "intro": "Derenbergia friedrichiae, commonly known as the Friedrich's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and debris. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
