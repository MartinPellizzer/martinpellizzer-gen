    "intro": "Dryopteris excellens, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive golden margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative propagation. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
