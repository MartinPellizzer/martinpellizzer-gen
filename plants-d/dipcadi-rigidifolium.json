    "intro": "Dipcadi rigidifolium, commonly known as the rigid-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant has a slender, yellowish stem with dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in certain regions."
