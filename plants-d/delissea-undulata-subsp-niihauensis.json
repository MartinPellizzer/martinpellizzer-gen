    "intro": "Delissea undulata subsp. niihauensis, commonly known as Niihau dandelion, is a rare plant native to the Hawaiian island of Niihau. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The leaves are typically spoon-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, while the stems are hairy and often reddish in color. This subspecies is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat, including dry, sandy soils and limited rainfall. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
