    "intro": "Dichaea standleyi, commonly known as the Standley's dichaea, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces delicate, linear leaves and bears small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its roots are adapted for absorbing water and nutrients from the substrate, and it thrives in high humidity and indirect light. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
