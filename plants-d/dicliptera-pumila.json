    "intro": "Dicliptera pumila, commonly known as dwarf dicliptera, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom during the wet season. Dicliptera pumila is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
