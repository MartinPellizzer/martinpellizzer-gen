    "intro": "Dioscorea chusqueifolia, commonly known as the Andean yam, is a climbing vine native to South America. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are used for both food and traditional medicine. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by capsule fruits. Its tubers are typically harvested for their starchy, edible qualities, though they require careful preparation to avoid toxic compounds. Dioscorea chusqueifolia is an important species in the Andean region, valued for its nutritional and medicinal properties."
