    "intro": "Dendrobium stricticalcarum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces raceme-like inflorescences with fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its leaves are narrow and linear, arranged in two rows along the pseudobulbs. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media."
