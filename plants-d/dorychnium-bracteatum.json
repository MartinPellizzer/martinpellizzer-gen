    "intro": "Dorychnium bracteatum, commonly known as the bracted burrweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, spiny pods. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early summer, followed by the development of its characteristic bracteate, pod-like fruits. Dorychnium bracteatum is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a food source for certain insects and birds."
