    "intro": "Dendrophorbium zongoense, commonly known as the Zongo tree, is a unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its dense, woody structure and ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces small, clustered flowers. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky soils. Dendrophorbium zongoense plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine species."
