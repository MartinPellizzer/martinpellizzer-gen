    "intro": "Drymaria diffusa, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread extensively. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Drymaria diffusa is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
