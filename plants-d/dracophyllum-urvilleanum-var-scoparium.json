    "intro": "Dracophyllum urvilleanum var. scoparium, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as birds and insects. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salty sea air, making it a hardy plant in coastal environments. The variety scoparium is distinguished by its more open branching and slightly different floral characteristics compared to other varieties of Dracophyllum urvilleanum."
