    "intro": "Dryopteris singaporiana, commonly known as the Singapore holly fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a rosette of leathery, dark green, serrated fronds that form a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are typically found on the upper portion of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses as a decorative plant."
