The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and is well adapted to cold, alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a species of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
