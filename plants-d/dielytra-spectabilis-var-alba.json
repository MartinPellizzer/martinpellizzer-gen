    "intro": "Dielytra spectabilis var. alba, commonly known as the white marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the upper part of the stem. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
