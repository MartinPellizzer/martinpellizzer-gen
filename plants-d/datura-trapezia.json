    "intro": "Datura trapezia, commonly known as the Mexican devil's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy blooms that open in the evening. Its leaves are ovate and pubescent, with a rough texture. Datura trapezia is known for its potent alkaloids, which make it both ecologically significant and potentially toxic to humans and animals."
