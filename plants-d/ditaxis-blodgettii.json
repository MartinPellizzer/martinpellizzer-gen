    "intro": "Ditaxis blodgettii, commonly known as the Blodgett's dittany, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
