    "intro": "Dracontia grandis, commonly known as the giant dragon fern, is a striking epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich substrates to flourish. Its unique growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and specialized collections. Dracontia grandis plays a role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to forest biodiversity."
