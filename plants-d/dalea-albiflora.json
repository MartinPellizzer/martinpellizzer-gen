    "intro": "Dalea albiflora, commonly known as whiteflower leadplant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. Dalea albiflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
