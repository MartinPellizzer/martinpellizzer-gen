    "intro": "Diplazium holttumii, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating the spread of its spore-producing structures. Diplazium holttumii plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
