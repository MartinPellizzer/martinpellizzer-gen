    "intro": "Dryopteris nigrosquamosa, commonly known as the black-scaled wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, velvety fronds that are covered in small, black, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
