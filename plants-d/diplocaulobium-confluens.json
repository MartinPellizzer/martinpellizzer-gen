    "intro": "Diplocaulobium confluens, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, and it produces showy yellow flowers that bloom from June to September. The plant has a complex root system that anchors it in muddy substrates and helps filter water. Its reproductive strategy involves both self-pollination and cross-pollination, facilitated by its insect-pollinated flowers. The plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality maintenance."
