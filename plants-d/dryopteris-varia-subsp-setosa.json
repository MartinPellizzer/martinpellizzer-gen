    "intro": "Dryopteris varia subsp. setosa, commonly known as the hairy woodfern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
