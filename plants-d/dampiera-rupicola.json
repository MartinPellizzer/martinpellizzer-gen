    "intro": "Dampiera rupicola, commonly known as the rock dampiera, is a perennial shrub native to the south-western regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows on rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Dampiera rupicola is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
