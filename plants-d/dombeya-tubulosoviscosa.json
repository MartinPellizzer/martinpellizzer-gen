    "intro": "Dombeya tubulosoviscosa, commonly known as the sticky-tubular dombeya, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its sticky texture. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. These flowers are adapted to attract specific pollinators, such as bees and hummingbirds. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
