    "intro": "Descantaria palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's bell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers, which are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, succulent-like leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. Descantaria palmeri is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and displaying a unique botanical structure suited to its desert habitat."
