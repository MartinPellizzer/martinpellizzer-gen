    "intro": "Daedalacanthus wardii, commonly known as the Ward's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble the shape of a ghostly face, giving it its common name. The plant has a unique growth habit, with a short, slender stem and a single, elongated leaf that supports its inflorescence. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to habitat destruction, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
