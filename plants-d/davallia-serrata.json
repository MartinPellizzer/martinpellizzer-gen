It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
