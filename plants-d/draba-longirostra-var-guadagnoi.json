    "intro": "Draba longirostra var. guadagnoi, commonly known as the Guadagno's whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Italy. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The species is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, clustered leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variant is distinguished by its elongated floral structures and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphology."
