    "intro": "Dysoxylum beddomei, commonly known as the beddome's dysoxylum, is a tropical tree belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to the island of Socotra, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and distinctive, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its native habitat. Dysoxylum beddomei is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and its role in the ecological dynamics of Socotra."
