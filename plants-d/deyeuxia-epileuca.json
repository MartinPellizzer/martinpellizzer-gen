It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. Deyeuxia epileuca is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
