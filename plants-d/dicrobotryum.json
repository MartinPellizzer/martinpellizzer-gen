    "intro": "Dicrobotryum, commonly known as the false broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host, and it can significantly weaken or even kill the host plant. Due to its parasitic nature, Dicrobotryum is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
