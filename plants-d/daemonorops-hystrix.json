    "intro": "Daemonorops hystrix, commonly known as the spiny cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in sharp, spiny projections. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
