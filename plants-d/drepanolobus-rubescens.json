    "intro": "Drepanolobus rubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It typically grows in dry, open habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. The bright red coloration of its stems and bracts makes it visually distinctive in its native environment."
