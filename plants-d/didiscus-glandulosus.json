    "intro": "Didiscus glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky disk plant, is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its unique floral structure and glandular features. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is known for its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that produce a sticky substance. The plant produces showy, disc-shaped flowers with numerous stamens, which are often brightly colored to attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture due to the presence of glandular hairs. Didiscus glandulosus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
