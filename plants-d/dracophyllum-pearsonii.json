    "intro": "Dracophyllum pearsonii, commonly known as the pearson's dracophyllum, is a low-growing shrub native to the southern regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Dracophyllum pearsonii is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
