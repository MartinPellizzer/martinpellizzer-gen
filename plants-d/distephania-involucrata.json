    "intro": "Distephania involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils in tropical regions. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
