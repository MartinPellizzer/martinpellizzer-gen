    "intro": "Dennstaedtia wercklei, commonly known as the Werckle's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in water absorption. The plant's spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
