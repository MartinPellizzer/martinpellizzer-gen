    "intro": "Dendrobium dalatense, commonly known as the Dalat orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in varying environmental conditions. Its flowers are typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Dendrobium dalatense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
