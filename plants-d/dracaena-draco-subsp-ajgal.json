It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown and thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its most notable feature is the red resin it exudes, which has been historically used for medicinal and dye purposes. This subspecies is adapted to the extreme climate of its native habitat, showcasing remarkable resilience and evolutionary traits."
