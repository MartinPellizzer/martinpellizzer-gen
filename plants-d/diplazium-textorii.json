    "intro": "Diplazium textorii, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, tree-like appearance with a thick, fibrous root system that anchors it to surfaces such as tree trunks or rocks. The plant has two types of leaves: sterile, spore-bearing fronds that form a dense, umbrella-like structure, and fertile fronds that are shorter and more upright. Diplazium textorii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high humidity and indirect light to flourish. Its unique morphology and ability to grow epiphytically make it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
