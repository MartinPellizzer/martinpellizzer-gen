    "intro": "Daviesia cordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed broom, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features slender, erect stems with narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow, pea-like flowers in late summer to early autumn, which are clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Daviesia cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens and restoration projects."
