    "intro": "Dianthus achtarovii, commonly known as the Achtarovii carnation, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red petals that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
