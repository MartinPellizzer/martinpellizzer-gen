    "intro": "Doria undulata, commonly known as the wavy orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Doria undulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
