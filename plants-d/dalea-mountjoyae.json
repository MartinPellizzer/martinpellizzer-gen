    "intro": "Dalea mountjoyae, commonly known as Mountjoy's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains. Its small, yellow to orange flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Dalea mountjoyae is considered a rare and endangered species."
