    "intro": "Dryopteris pectinata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, frond-like leaves that are divided into soft, fuzzy segments resembling a cinnamon stick. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in a fiddlehead-like structure at the base. Dryopteris pectinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various organisms."
