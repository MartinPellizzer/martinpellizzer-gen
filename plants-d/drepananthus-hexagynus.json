    "intro": "Drepananthus hexagynus, commonly known as the six-ovary grass, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a component of wetland and riparian ecosystems. Drepananthus hexagynus is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in swampy areas."
