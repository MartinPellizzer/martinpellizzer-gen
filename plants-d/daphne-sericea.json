    "intro": "Daphne sericea, commonly known as silver daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring caution in cultivation."
