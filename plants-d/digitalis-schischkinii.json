    "intro": "Digitalis schischkinii, commonly known as Schischkin's foxglove, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and striking, hooded flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant produces tubular flowers that open in the morning and close in the evening, a feature known as nyctinasty. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
