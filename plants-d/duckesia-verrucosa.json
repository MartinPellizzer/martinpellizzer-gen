    "intro": "Duckesia verrucosa, commonly known as the woolly duckweed, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It is characterized by its tiny, floating leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly coating of fine hairs, which helps it to retain moisture and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged or just at the water's surface. It is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow streams, where it forms dense mats on the water's surface. Duckesia verrucosa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
