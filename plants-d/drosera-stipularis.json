    "intro": "Drosera stipularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It features sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that secrete a sweet-smelling mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swamps. Its leaves are narrow and often have a reddish hue, especially when exposed to sunlight. Drosera stipularis is a perennial species that reproduces through seeds and can form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
