    "intro": "Dracaena renardiae, commonly known as the Renard's dracaena, is a rare and striking plant native to the island of Pr\u00edncipe in the Comoros archipelago. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and long, narrow leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Dracaena renardiae is adapted to grow in rocky, coastal environments and is highly susceptible to habitat loss. Due to its limited distribution and threats from deforestation, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN."
