    "intro": "Draba oreades var. setosa, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, basal leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers. Native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe, this variety thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant is often found in mountainous regions, contributing to the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems."
