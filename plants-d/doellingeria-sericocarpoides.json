    "intro": "Doellingeria sericocarpoides, commonly known as the silky-fruited beakweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature typical of many members of the Asteraceae family. Doellingeria sericocarpoides typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks."
