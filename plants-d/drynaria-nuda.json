    "intro": "Drynaria nuda, commonly known as the naked tree fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery, light green fronds that grow in a spiral pattern. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to form dense clumps and spread vegetatively. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets arranged along the rachis. Drynaria nuda prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks."
