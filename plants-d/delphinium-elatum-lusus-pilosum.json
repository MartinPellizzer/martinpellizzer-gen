    "intro": "Delphinium elatum lusus pilosum, commonly known as the hairy larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, hairy textures, giving it a distinctive appearance. This species is valued in gardens for its ornamental value but is toxic to livestock and humans due to its alkaloid content."
