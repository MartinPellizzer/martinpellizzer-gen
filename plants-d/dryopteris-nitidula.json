    "intro": "Dryopteris nitidula, commonly known as the glossy wood fern, is a species of polypod fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and its distinctive, glossy, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The fronds are typically evergreen, with a leathery texture that helps the plant retain moisture in its woodland habitat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a thin, membranous indusium."
