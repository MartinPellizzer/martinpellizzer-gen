    "intro": "Dendrobangia tenuis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. The plant produces delicate, pendant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often blooming during the rainy season. It requires high humidity and indirect light to flourish, making it a challenging but rewarding plant for experienced growers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
