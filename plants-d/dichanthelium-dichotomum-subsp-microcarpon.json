    "intro": "Dichanthelium dichotomum subsp. microcarpon, commonly known as the small-seeded dichotomous grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense tufts, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing two to three bristle-like awns. The subspecies is distinguished by its small, dark brown seeds and its unique branching pattern, which gives it its common name."
