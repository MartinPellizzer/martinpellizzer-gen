    "intro": "Diplazium virescens var. conterminum, commonly known as the broadleaf chain fern, is a variant of the chain fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is a fern characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant features a stout, creeping rhizome with a dense covering of roots, which helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a dark green, glossy appearance. This fern thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forest understories where it receives indirect sunlight."
