    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata subsp. judaica, commonly known as Jerusalem grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, two-lobed flowers. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in poor agricultural conditions. This subspecies is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and resilience."
