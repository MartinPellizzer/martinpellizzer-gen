    "intro": "Dionaea uniflora, commonly known as the sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of North and South Carolina. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested by the plant. The plant's leaves are typically rosette-shaped and can curl around prey to aid in digestion. It produces a single, showy flower per stem, which is usually pink or reddish in color. Dionaea uniflora thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires high humidity and abundant sunlight to flourish."
