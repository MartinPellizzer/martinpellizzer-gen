    "intro": "Dendrobium terrestre var. sublobatum, commonly known as the terrestrial orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid, meaning it grows in soil rather than on trees, which is unusual for the Dendrobium genus. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white, yellow, or green. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to cultivation."
