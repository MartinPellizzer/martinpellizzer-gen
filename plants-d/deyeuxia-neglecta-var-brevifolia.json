    "intro": "Deyeuxia neglecta var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved false panicgrass, is a grass species native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
