    "intro": "Drosera fulva, commonly known as the golden sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, sticky leaves that trap insects, which are then digested by the plant's enzymes. The plant produces a bright yellow coloration due to the presence of carotenoids in its tissues. It thrives in wet, acidic environments and is often found in swampy or boggy areas. Drosera fulva is a perennial species that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height, with a rosette of leaves surrounding a central stem."
