It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its striking, cone-shaped inflorescences. The plant produces small, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its natural habitat. Dryandra ferruginea is also known for its resilience to drought and its role in local ecosystems."
