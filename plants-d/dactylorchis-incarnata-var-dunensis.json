    "intro": "Dactylorchis incarnata var. dunensis, commonly known as the Dunedin orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it has a short, stout rhizome. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
