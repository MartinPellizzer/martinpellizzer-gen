    "intro": "Diplazium tenebrosum, commonly known as the dark fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fertile fronds."
