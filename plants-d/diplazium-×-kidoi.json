    "intro": "Diplazium \u00d7 kidoi, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Diplazium esculentum and Diplazium sellowianum. It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
