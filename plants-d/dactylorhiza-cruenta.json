    "intro": "Dactylorhiza cruenta, commonly known as the crimson twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as woodlands and heaths. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces a single spike of flowers during the summer months. Dactylorhiza cruenta is also known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, which is a common trait among orchids."
