    "intro": "Duania, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Duania is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an aggressive weed in many regions."
