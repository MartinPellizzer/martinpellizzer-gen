    "intro": "Drymaria rotundifolia, commonly known as roundleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, fleshy, round leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers during the summer months. It is often found in rocky soils and sandy habitats, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy ornamental plant suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
