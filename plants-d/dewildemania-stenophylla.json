    "intro": "Dewildemania stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dewildemania, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are tightly packed along its stem. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting specific pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
