    "intro": "Dryopteris nutans, commonly known as the nodding wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a robust rhizome system that supports its growth in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces fertile fronds with spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. Its foliage is characterized by a delicate, feathery appearance with a distinct, nodding habit. Dryopteris nutans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
