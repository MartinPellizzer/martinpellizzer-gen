    "intro": "Dactylorhiza incarnata lusus albida, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with its dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands. It has a complex root system and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
