    "intro": "Dactylis polygama f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved cat's ear, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, spoon-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including poor and rocky soils. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish flowers in spikelets, which are typically arranged in clusters along the stem. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, where it contributes to soil stabilization. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
