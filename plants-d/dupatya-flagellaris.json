    "intro": "Dupatya flagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble the structure of a flagellum. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged in a unique linear pattern along the margins of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dupatya flagellaris is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
