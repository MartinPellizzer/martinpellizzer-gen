    "intro": "Dryopteris deparioides subsp. concinna, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. The fronds are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments with a distinctive, serrated edge. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in woodland areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its hardy and adaptable nature."
