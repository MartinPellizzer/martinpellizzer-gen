    "intro": "Dissiliaria surculosa, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, spirally arranged leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
