The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically during the dry season. Its leaves are long and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Dendrobium micholitzii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
