    "intro": "Dunbaria conspersa, commonly known as the hairy dunbaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
