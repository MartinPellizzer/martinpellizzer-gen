    "intro": "Dendrobium affine, commonly known as the common dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that bear clusters of fragrant, white or yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically broad and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium affine is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its showy blooms."
