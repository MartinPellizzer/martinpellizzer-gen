    "intro": "Daphne striata, commonly known as the spotted daphne, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive white or pale markings along the veins. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring. It is evergreen and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it is toxic to both humans and animals."
