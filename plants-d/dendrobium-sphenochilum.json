    "intro": "Dendrobium sphenochilum, commonly known as the orchid with the \"scented lip,\" is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length, and its flowers are usually white or pale yellow with a distinctive, fragrant lip. It thrives in humid environments with high light exposure and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium sphenochilum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beautiful, long-lasting blooms."
