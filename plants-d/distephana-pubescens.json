    "intro": "Distephana pubescens, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small white or pale green flowers, followed by berries that are typically red or yellow. It is native to parts of South America and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis."
