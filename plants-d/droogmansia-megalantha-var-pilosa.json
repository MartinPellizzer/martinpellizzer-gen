    "intro": "Droogmansia megalantha var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy giant droogmansia, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to South America. This plant is characterized by its large, upright rosettes of broad, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, almost woolly appearance. The leaves are typically green with a silvery or grayish hue due to the dense pubescence. It produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear bright red or orange flowers, which are showy and attract pollinators. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
