    "intro": "Draba parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassius bellflower, is a small flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many cruciferous plants. The plant produces delicate, four-petaled flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Draba parnassica is adapted to high-altitude environments, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cold, arid conditions."
