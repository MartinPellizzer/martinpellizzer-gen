    "intro": "Danhatchia copelandii, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its evergreen, arching fronds that remain green throughout the winter. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The fronds have a distinctive, curled appearance that resembles a Christmas tree, giving it its common name."
