    "intro": "Dudleya brevifolia, commonly known as the coastal dudleya, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring. It is well adapted to arid and coastal environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in rocky soils. Dudleya brevifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
