It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or arctic regions. The plant produces small, cruciform flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, and its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and often covered in fine hairs. It is characterized by its ability to survive in harsh environments due to its deep root system and frost-resistant properties. Dactylicapnos odontocarpa plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
