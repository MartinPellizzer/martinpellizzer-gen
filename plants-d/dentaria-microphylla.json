    "intro": "Dentaria microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved toothplant, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the end of each stem, typically blooming in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and has been historically used in traditional medicine. Dentaria microphylla thrives in moist, woodland soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments."
