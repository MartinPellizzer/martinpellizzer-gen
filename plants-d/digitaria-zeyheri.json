    "intro": "Digitaria zeyheri, commonly known as Zeyher's Digitaria, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and along the edges of forests, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spikelet cluster, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in restoration ecology due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
