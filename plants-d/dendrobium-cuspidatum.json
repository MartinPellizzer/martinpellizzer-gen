    "intro": "Dendrobium cuspidatum, commonly known as the spike orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Dendrobium cuspidatum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
