It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which reflects sunlight and reduces water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions."
