    "intro": "Dryopteris rheophila, commonly known as the stream fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically growing along streams and in shaded forest floors. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is notable for its ability to tolerate high humidity and is often found in areas with rich, organic soil."
