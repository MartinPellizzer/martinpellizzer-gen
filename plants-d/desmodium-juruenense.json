    "intro": "Desmodium juruenense, commonly known as the Juruenense burr legume, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind or animals. Its growth habit is typically herbaceous, with a sprawling or climbing form depending on the environmental conditions. Desmodium juruenense is also noted for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
