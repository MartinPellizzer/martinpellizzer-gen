    "intro": "Disperma repens, commonly known as the creeping disperma, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the short growing season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand harsh cold and strong winds. Disperma repens is an important component of tundra ecosystems, providing food for various herbivores."
