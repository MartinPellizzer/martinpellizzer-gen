    "intro": "Dryopteris dickinsii, commonly known as the Dickins' wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant prefers cool, moist, and shaded environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are released from small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
