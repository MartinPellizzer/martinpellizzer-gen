    "intro": "Dalea confusa var. hexandra, commonly known as the six-angled milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves with a hairy texture, and its seed pods are slender and curved. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. This species is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for native wildlife."
