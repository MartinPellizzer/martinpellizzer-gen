    "intro": "Draba aizoides subsp. cantabriae, commonly known as the Cantabrian whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions, particularly in the Cantabrian Mountains. It is adapted to cold, temperate climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
