    "intro": "Diplazium lucidum, commonly known as the shining water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are glossy and often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a network of roots that help anchor it in the soil. Diplazium lucidum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils."
