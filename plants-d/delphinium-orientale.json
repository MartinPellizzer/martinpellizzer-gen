    "intro": "Delphinium orientale, commonly known as the oriental larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking flower color and long blooming period in late spring to early summer."
