    "intro": "Dactylorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Dactylorchis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
