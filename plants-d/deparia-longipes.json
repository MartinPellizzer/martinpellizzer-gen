    "intro": "Deparia longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed wood fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous fertile and sterile fronds. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a distinctive pattern."
