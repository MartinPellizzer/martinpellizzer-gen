It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are white or pale yellow. This variety is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and larger, more numerous flowers compared to other Draba species."
