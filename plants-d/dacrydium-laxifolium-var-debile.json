    "intro": "Dacrydium laxifolium var. debile, commonly known as the slender-leaved silver pine, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in subalpine or montane regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
