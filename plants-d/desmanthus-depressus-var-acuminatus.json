    "intro": "Desmanthus depressus var. acuminatus, commonly known as the sharp-pointed desmanthus, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to well-drained, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for use in erosion control and wildlife habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility, and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable habitats."
