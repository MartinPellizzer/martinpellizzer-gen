    "intro": "Dracaena suffruticosa, commonly known as the dragon tree, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, evergreen foliage that forms a bushy crown. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Its roots can form a symbiotic relationship with the scale insect *Dactylopius coccus*, which produces the crimson dye cochineal. Dracaena suffruticosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in dye production."
