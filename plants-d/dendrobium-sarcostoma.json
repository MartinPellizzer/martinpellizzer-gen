    "intro": "Dendrobium sarcostoma, commonly known as the orchid of the genus Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that are often covered in dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow and bloom in late summer or early autumn. Dendrobium sarcostoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
