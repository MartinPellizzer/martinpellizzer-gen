    "intro": "Deutzia dumicola, commonly known as the rock deutzia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, arching stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually gray-green in color. It produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Deutzia dumicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
