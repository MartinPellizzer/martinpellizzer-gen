It is characterized by its delicate, ephemeral flowers that often appear and disappear quickly, giving it its ethereal reputation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Its leaves are usually small, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem. Disquamia species are known for their short blooming period and their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
