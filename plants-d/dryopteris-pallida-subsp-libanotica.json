    "intro": "Dryopteris pallida subsp. libanotica, commonly known as the pale fern or the Lebanon shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, light green fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
