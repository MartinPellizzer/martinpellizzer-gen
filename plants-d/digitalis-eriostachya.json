    "intro": "Digitalis eriostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved foxglove, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of hooded flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
