    "intro": "Decaspermum exiguum, commonly known as the small spore grass, is a small annual herb belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is found in arid and semi-arid regions. Due to its low stature and specialized adaptations, it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native habitats."
