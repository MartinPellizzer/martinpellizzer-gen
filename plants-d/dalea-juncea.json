    "intro": "Dalea juncea, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. Dalea juncea is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for native pollinators."
