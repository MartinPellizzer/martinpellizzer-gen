    "intro": "Dryopteris delicatula, commonly known as the delicate wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically arching and graceful in appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, feathery texture that gives it a distinctive, elegant look."
