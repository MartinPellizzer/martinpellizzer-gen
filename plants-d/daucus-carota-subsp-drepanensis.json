    "intro": "Daucus carota subsp. drepanensis, commonly known as the Mediterranean carrot, is a subspecies of the wild carrot native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in umbels. The leaves are finely divided and aromatic, with a distinctive carrot-like scent. Its root system is less developed compared to the cultivated carrot, and the roots are typically smaller and less fleshy. This subspecies is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates."
