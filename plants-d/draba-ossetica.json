    "intro": "Draba ossetica, commonly known as the Ossetian whitlow, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a compact cluster, which bloom in early spring. Draba ossetica is native to the Caucasus region and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
