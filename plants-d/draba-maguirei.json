    "intro": "Draba maguirei, commonly known as Maguire's whitlow grass, is a small, flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clustered flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees. Draba maguirei is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in alpine meadows and talus slopes. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
