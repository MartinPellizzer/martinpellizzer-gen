    "intro": "Dendrobium vernicosum, commonly known as the sandhill orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces racemes of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sun exposure. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for specific ecological conditions in its native habitat."
