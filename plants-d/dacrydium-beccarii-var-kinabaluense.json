    "intro": "Dacrydium beccarii var. kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu pine, is a coniferous tree native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It is characterized by its slender, evergreen foliage and distinctive cone-like structures. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to the cool, moist climate of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are typically needle-like, and the tree can reach heights of up to 30 meters. This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its restricted distribution and ecological significance in the region."
