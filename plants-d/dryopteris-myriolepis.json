    "intro": "Dryopteris myriolepis, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which are further subdivided into smaller pinnules, giving the plant a lush, intricate appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant's rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in its natural habitat."
