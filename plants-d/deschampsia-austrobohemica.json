    "intro": "Deschampsia austrobohemica, commonly known as the Bohemian feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to central Europe. It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, wiry stems that often lean over, creating a mat-like appearance. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually gray-green in color, and it blooms with delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, fluffy seeds. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in regions with temperate climates. Deschampsia austrobohemica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
