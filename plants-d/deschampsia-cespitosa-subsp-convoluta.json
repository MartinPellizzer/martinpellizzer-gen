It forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, wiry stems that often curl in a spiral, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
