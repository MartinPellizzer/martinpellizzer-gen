    "intro": "Dryopteris xunwuensis, commonly known as the Xunwu Shield Fern, is a species native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive, shield-shaped appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
