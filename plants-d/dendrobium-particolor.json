    "intro": "Dendrobium particolor, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in varying environmental conditions. Dendrobium particolor is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant floral display."
