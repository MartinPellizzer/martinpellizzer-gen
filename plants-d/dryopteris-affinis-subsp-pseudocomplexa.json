    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis subsp. pseudocomplexa, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, broad, and leathery fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, rounded pinnae that give the plant a dense, bushy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sori, which are grouped into clusters called sorus."
