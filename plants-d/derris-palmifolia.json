    "intro": "Derris palmifolia, commonly known as the giant climbing bean, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves and long, trailing vines that can reach significant lengths. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated pods containing flat, bean-like seeds. Native to tropical regions of Asia, it thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. Due to its rapid growth and potential invasiveness, it is often cultivated as an ornamental or for its use in traditional medicine."
