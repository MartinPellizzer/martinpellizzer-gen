    "intro": "Delphinium geyeri var. geraniifolium, commonly known as the Geranium-leaved Larkspur, is a striking perennial herb native to the western United States. It features tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of vivid blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are deeply lobed and resemble those of geraniums, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is a popular choice in gardens and wildflower displays."
