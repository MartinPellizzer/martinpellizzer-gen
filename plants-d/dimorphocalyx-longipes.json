It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in cymes, often with two different leaf shapes on the same stem, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
