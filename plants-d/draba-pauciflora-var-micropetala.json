    "intro": "Draba pauciflora var. micropetala, commonly known as the small-petioled whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is distinguished by its smaller petals and shorter petioles compared to the typical form of Draba pauciflora."
