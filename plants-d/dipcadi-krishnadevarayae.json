    "intro": "Dipcadi krishnadevarayae, commonly known as the Krishna Devaraya's dipcadi, is a rare flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and lanceolate, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
