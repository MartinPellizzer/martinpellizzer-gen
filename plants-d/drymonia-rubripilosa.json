    "intro": "Drymonia rubripilosa, commonly known as the red-hair fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a reddish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests or along stream banks. Its spores are released from small, fleshy structures called sorus, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. Drymonia rubripilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
