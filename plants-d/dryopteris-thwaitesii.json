    "intro": "Dryopteris thwaitesii, commonly known as the Thwaites' wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure that gives the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate woodlands. The plant's rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time."
