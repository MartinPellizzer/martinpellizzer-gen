    "intro": "Dryopteris sparsa var. viridescens, commonly known as the greenish wood fern, is a variant of the sparse wood fern native to temperate regions of Asia. It is a medium-sized fern characterized by its upright, slender fronds that are typically green with a slight bluish or grayish tinge. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that distinguishes it from other fern species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori along the veins."
