    "intro": "Dianthus petraeus subsp. minutiflorus, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial species characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, thriving in high-altitude conditions."
