    "intro": "Dischidia ruscifolia, commonly known as the creeping fig or silver vine, is a climbing tropical plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing several seeds. Dischidia ruscifolia is native to Southeast Asia and is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid environments. It is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
