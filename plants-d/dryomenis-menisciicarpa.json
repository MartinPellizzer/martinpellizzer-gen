    "intro": "Dryomenis menisciicarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit bladder nut, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fagaceae. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces unique, bladder-like fruits that encase its seeds. The plant is native to certain regions of Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in temperate forest environments. Its botanical features include a woody stem, alternate leaf arrangement, and small, inconspicuous flowers. The fruit matures to a leathery texture, providing protection to the seeds until they are dispersed."
