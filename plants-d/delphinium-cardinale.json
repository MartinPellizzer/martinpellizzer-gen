    "intro": "Delphinium cardinale, commonly known as the cardinal larkspur, is a striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in the western United States and parts of Canada. The plant is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of showy blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
