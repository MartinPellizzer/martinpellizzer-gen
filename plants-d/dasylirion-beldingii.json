    "intro": "Dasylirion beldingii, commonly known as the Belding's sotol, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of long, sword-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces striking, branched inflorescences of yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber."
