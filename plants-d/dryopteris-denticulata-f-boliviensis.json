    "intro": "Dryopteris denticulata f. boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian holly fern, is a fern species native to South America, particularly Bolivia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely toothed, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
