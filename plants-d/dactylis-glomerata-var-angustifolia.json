    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as fields, roadsides, and pastures. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in forage and erosion control. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively and form dense mats."
