    "intro": "Diplazium bhutanense, commonly known as Bhutanese water fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayan region, particularly Bhutan. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine in the region for their purported health benefits. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
