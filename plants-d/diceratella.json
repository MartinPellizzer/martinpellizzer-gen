    "intro": "Diceratella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Diceratella is considered a conservation concern."
