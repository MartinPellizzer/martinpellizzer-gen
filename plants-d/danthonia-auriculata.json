    "intro": "Danthonia auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Danthonia auriculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
