    "intro": "Diplazium virescens, commonly known as the green shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are divided into segments with a distinctive, shield-like appearance, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has pinnate leaves with serrated margins and produces spores in small, clustered clusters on the undersides of its fronds."
