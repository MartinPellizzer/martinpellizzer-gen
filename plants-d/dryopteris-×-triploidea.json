    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 triploidea, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant is native to the temperate regions of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its fronds are typically dark green with a leathery texture and exhibit a distinctive bipinnate structure. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters known as sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering called an indusium."
