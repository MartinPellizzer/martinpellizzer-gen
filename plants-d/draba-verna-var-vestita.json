    "intro": "Draba verna var. vestita, commonly known as the white spring sandwort, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, usually between March and May. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is distinguished by its white flowers, which contrast with the green foliage, making it a notable species in its ecological niche."
