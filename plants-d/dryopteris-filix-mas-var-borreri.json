    "intro": "Dryopteris filix-mas var. borreri, commonly known as the Borreri male fern, is a variant of the male fern native to parts of Asia. It is a perennial fern characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are often deeply divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
