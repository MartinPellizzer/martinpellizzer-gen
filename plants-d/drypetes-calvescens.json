    "intro": "Drypetes calvescens, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-brown bark and alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. It is valued for its durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overexploitation."
