    "intro": "Dendrobium fytchianum, commonly known as the Fytch's orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, long-lasting orchid flowers in shades of yellow and orange. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its unique appearance and hardiness make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
