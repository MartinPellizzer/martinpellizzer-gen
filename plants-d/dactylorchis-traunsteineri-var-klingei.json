    "intro": "Dactylorchis traunsteineri var. klingei, commonly known as the Traunsteiner's dactylorchis, is a rare orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, favoring rich, humus-filled soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often clustered at the base of the plant. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
