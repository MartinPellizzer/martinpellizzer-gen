    "intro": "Dudleya regalis, commonly known as the royal dudleya, is a succulent plant native to California and Baja California. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming structure with fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces tall, branched flowering stems that bear clusters of star-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink or white. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Dudleya regalis is also noted for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy leaves, allowing it to survive in arid conditions."
