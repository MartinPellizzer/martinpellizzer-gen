    "intro": "Dryopteris balearica, commonly known as the Balearic wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped pinnae. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are protected by a fertile indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural gardens."
