    "intro": "Draba altaica, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale purple. Draba altaica thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing in open, sunny areas. Its short stature and rapid life cycle make it well-adapted to the harsh conditions of its habitat."
