    "intro": "Delphinium carolinianum, commonly known as the Carolina larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often avoided in gardens where children or pets are present."
