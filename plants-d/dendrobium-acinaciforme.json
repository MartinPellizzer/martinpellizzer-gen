    "intro": "Dendrobium acinaciforme, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs that are often covered in a layer of moss-like tissue. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, sword-shaped lip. Dendrobium acinaciforme thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
