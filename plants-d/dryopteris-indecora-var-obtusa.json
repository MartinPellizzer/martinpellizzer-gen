    "intro": "Dryopteris indecora var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It features large, deeply lobed, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a broad, rounded shape. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in lines along the veins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shade gardens and naturalistic landscapes."
