    "intro": "Dryopteris enneaphylla var. toyamae, commonly known as the Toyama wood fern, is a variant of the nine-pinnate wood fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its elegant, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a compact, upright habit. The plant features a fertile frond with sporangia arranged in clusters along the pinnae, typical of the Dryopteris genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The varietal distinction is based on subtle differences in frond morphology and habitat preferences."
