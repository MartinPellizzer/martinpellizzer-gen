    "intro": "Dicliptera umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it forms dense clusters of grass-like foliage. The plant is characterized by its upright, cylindrical stems and produces small, clustered inflorescences resembling an umbrella, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a fibrous texture, and it often thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Dicliptera umbellata is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
