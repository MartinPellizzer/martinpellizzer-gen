    "intro": "Dryopteris spinulosa, commonly known as the spinulose wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It features a tall, upright frond structure with a distinctive, serrated leaf margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
