    "intro": "Dryopteris cinerea, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, silvery-gray fronds that are covered in fine, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it in its habitat. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
