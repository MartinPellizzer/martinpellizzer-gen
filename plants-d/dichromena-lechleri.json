    "intro": "Dichromena lechleri, commonly known as the caapi vine, is a climbing plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dark, woody stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant is known for its use in traditional shamanic practices, particularly in the preparation of ayahuasca. Its alkaloid-rich bark contains compounds such as harmine and tetrahydroharmine, which contribute to its psychoactive effects. Dichromena lechleri thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a significant role in the ecological and cultural landscape of the Amazon."
