    "intro": "Draba hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces small, elongated seed pods that release tiny seeds when mature. Its hardy nature and ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils make it a notable species in high-altitude ecosystems."
