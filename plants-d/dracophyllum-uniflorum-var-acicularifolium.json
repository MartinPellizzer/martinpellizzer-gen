    "intro": "Dracophyllum uniflorum var. acicularifolium, commonly known as the needle-leaved dracophyllum, is a shrub native to the cool, moist regions of southern Australia. It features compact, evergreen foliage with needle-like leaves that are densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its foliage is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and hardiness. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water once established."
