    "intro": "Dorstenia paucibracteata, commonly known as the little leaf false arum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants characterized by their unique inflorescence structure known as a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in its native habitat. It produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Dorstenia paucibracteata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-draining soil with indirect light."
