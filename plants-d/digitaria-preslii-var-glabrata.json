    "intro": "Digitaria preslii var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth digitgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
