    "intro": "Dicksonia sorbifolia, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant's fronds are bioluminescent, a unique feature that helps it attract pollinators in the dark. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Dicksonia sorbifolia plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's native ecosystems."
