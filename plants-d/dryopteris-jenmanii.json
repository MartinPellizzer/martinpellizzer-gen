    "intro": "Dryopteris jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers cool, moist, and shaded environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizome is creeping, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
