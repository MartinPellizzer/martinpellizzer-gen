    "intro": "Discocactus zehntneri subsp. petr-halfarii, commonly known as the Petr-Halfari Discocactus, is a rare and compact cactus native to the arid regions of Namibia. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a dark green to bluish-green coloration, often marked with distinctive white or pale warts. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in its native range."
