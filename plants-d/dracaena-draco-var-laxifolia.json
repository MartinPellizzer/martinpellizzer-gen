    "intro": "Dracaena draco var. laxifolia, commonly known as the dragon tree or dragon blood tree, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, branching trunk and narrow, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that give way to red, fleshy fruits. Its most notable feature is the resinous sap, known as dragon's blood, which has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and dyes. This variety is adapted to arid environments and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
