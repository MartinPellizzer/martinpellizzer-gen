    "intro": "Dalbergia fusca, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of legume native to South America. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, reddish-brown color and a fine, even grain. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The fruit is a legume pod that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
