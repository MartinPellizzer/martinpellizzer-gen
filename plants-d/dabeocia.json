    "intro": "Dabeocia, commonly known as the sacred lotus of ancient Egypt, is a flowering plant belonging to the Nelumbonaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks rising from water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, often with a waxy coating to repel water. Dabeocia was revered for its symbolic and spiritual significance in Egyptian culture. Its botanical features make it a unique and culturally important aquatic plant."
