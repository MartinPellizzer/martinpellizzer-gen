    "intro": "Dichelachne rara subsp. asperula, commonly known as the rough dichelachne, is a grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along waterways. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
