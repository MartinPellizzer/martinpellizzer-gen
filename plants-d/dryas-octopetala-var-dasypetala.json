    "intro": "Dryas octopetala var. dasypetala, commonly known as the hairy-leaved mountain avens, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The leaves are typically hairy, with a waxy coating that helps protect against harsh weather conditions. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value in rocky gardens. This plant is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude areas."
