    "intro": "Dendrobium constrictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, with a distinctive red or purple lip. Dendrobium constrictum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated for its beauty and fragrance."
