    "intro": "Dendrophthoe fuscata, commonly known as the Indian milk bush, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of other plants, primarily in the genus Acacia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and has a unique, woody stem that often appears as a shrub. It is native to regions of India and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
