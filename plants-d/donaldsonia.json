    "intro": "Donaldsonia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the wetlands of Australia and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, translucent leaves and delicate, white or pale green flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized adaptations to humid, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Donaldsonia is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
