It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain flat, elongated seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
