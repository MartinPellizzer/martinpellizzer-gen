    "intro": "Dorstenia intermedia, commonly known as the \"corky-leafed spiderplant,\" is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unusual foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor conditions. Dorstenia intermedia is also notable for its ability to store water in its leaves, making it relatively drought-tolerant."
