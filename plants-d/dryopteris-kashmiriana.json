    "intro": "Dryopteris kashmiriana, commonly known as the Kashmir fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the Himalayan regions of Pakistan, India, and Afghanistan. It is characterized by its delicate fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a common feature among ferns. The plant's rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of brownish scales, which help it survive in its mountainous habitat."
