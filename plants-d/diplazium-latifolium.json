    "intro": "Diplazium latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, and leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically divided into a series of pinnae, which are further subdivided into smaller pinnules. Diplazium latifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
