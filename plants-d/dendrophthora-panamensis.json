    "intro": "Dendrophthora panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in Central America. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and has a symbiotic relationship with its host, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are evergreen and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Dendrophthora panamensis plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and other wildlife."
