    "intro": "Danaea epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic plant that grows on the surfaces of trees and other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. Danaea epiphytica thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
