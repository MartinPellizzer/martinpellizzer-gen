    "intro": "Daphne papyracea subsp. jinyunensis, commonly known as the Jinyun daphne, is a rare and ornamental plant native to China. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial shade to full sun, depending on the climate. It is noted for its unique morphology and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
