    "intro": "Dichapetalum choristilum var. choristilum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its dark red to purple bark and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to rocky and lateritic soils. Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
