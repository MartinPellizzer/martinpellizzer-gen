    "intro": "Delphinium calthifolium, commonly known as the meadow larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens."
