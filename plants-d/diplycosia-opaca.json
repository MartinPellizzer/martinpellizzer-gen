It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and dense, rounded growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often growing in heathlands and coastal scrub. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
