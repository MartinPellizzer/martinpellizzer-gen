It features slender, arching fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough, scaly texture on the underside. The plant is native to parts of Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through underground stems. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in humid climates."
