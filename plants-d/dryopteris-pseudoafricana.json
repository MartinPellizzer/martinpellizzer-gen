    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudoafricana, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into shield-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of sporangia on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and light conditions."
