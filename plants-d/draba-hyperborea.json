    "intro": "Draba hyperborea, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in harsh environments, including rocky soils and tundra, where it forms dense mats to protect itself from extreme cold and wind. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. Draba hyperborea plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife in its extreme habitat."
