    "intro": "Drosera stolonifera subsp. porrecta, commonly known as the sprawling sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers on slender stalks, which bloom in summer. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats over time."
