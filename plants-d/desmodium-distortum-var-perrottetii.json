    "intro": "Desmodium distortum var. perrottetii, commonly known as the warty desmodium, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with warty projections on the leaflets, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, followed by narrow, elongated pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
