    "intro": "Drummondita hassellii var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved drummondia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Australia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant features slender, often sprawling stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or cream, clustered in dense, raceme-like inflorescences, and bloom during the warmer months. This variety is noted for its resilience and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops."
