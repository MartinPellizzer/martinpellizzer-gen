    "intro": "Delphinium peregrinum var. oranense, commonly known as the Armenian larkspur, is a tall, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It grows to heights of up to 2 meters, with a slender stem that is often branched. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role in the ecosystems of its native range."
