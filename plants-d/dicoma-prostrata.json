    "intro": "Dicoma prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate dicoma, is a low-growing succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Dicoma prostrata is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
