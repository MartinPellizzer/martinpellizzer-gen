It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow to purple flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas and is adapted to humid, cool climates. It is a perennial herb that forms clumps and has a rhizomatous root system. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a wide range of morphological variation, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
