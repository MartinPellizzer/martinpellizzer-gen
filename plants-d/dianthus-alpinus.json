    "intro": "Dianthus alpinus, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and features showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often pink or red in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Dianthus alpinus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and resilience."
