    "intro": "Dansiea elliptica, commonly known as the elliptical dansiea, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often a deep green with a waxy texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale yellow, and it produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
