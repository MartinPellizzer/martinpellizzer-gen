    "intro": "Dianthus collinus subsp. collinus, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features slender, hairy stems and produces clusters of pink or red, five-petaled flowers. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
