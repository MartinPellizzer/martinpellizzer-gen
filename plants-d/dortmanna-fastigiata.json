    "intro": "Dortmanna fastigiata, commonly known as the narrowleaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences and bloom in late spring to early summer. Dortmanna fastigiata is known for its ability to thrive in wet environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
