    "intro": "Davallia solida var. ornata, commonly known as the silver-veined fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often adorned with silvery veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The foliage is evergreen, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
