    "intro": "Drosera occidentalis subsp. australis, commonly known as the Australian sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insect prey. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its small, white flowers bloom in summer, and it is often found in coastal regions. This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and relies on insect prey for essential nutrients."
