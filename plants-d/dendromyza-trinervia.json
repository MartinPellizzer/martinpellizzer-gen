    "intro": "Dendromyza trinervia, commonly known as the three-veined fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into three main veins, giving it its scientific name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Dendromyza trinervia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
