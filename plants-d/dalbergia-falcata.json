    "intro": "Dalbergia falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in the production of musical instruments and fine furniture. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species."
