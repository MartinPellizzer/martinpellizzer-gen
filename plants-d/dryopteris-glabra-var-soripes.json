It is a perennial fern native to various regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features lance-shaped, smooth, and glossy fronds that are typically dark green. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
