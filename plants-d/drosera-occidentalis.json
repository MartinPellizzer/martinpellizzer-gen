    "intro": "Drosera occidentalis, commonly known as the western sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sweet nectar to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are often rosette-shaped, and it produces small, white flowers during the summer months. Drosera occidentalis is a hardy species that can survive in cold climates and is often used in botanical gardens for its unique appearance and ecological role."
