    "intro": "Dryopteris chapaensis, commonly known as the Chapa fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often divided into numerous segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to woodland gardens."
