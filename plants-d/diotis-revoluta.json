    "intro": "Diotis revoluta, commonly known as the revolute diotis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates."
