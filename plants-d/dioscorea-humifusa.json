    "intro": "Dioscorea humifusa, commonly known as wild yam, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stolons that root at the nodes and its palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Dioscorea humifusa is notable for its tuberous roots, which have been used historically in traditional medicine."
