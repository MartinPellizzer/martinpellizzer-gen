It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in two rows along the stems. Dendrobium ciliatilabellum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
