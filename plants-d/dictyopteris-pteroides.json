    "intro": "Dictyopteris pteroides, commonly known as the feather sea palm, is a species of brown algae belonging to the family Dictyopteridaceae. It is characterized by its fronds that resemble the structure of a palm tree, with a central axis and branching, feather-like blades. This plant typically grows in shallow, coastal waters and is often found in the intertidal zone. Its thallus is leathery and robust, capable of withstanding wave action and desiccation. Dictyopteris pteroides plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
