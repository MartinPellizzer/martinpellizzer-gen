    "intro": "Dendrobium multifolium, commonly known as the many-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a tall, cane-like stem with multiple leaves arranged along its length. Its flowers are typically yellow or green with red or purple markings, and they bloom in clusters. Dendrobium multifolium thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light."
