    "intro": "Digitaria scaettae, commonly known as the Italian grass or scaetta grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Digitaria scaettae thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component of native plant gardens."
