    "intro": "Dalea obovatifolia var. uncifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with oval, pointed leaflets, and its root system is well adapted to arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. This species is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for native wildlife."
