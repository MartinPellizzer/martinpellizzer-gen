    "intro": "Dolichos palmatifidus, commonly known as the broad-leafed cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its palmately divided leaves, which give it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm climate with adequate sunlight. Dolichos palmatifidus is valued for its nutritional seeds and its role in soil nitrogen fixation."
