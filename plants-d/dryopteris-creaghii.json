    "intro": "Dryopteris creaghii, commonly known as the Creagh's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense layer of rhizomorphs, which help anchor it to rocky substrates. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
