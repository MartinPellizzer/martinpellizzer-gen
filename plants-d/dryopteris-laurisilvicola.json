    "intro": "Dryopteris laurisilvicola, commonly known as the laurel fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in a dense, brownish coating. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, paper-like indusium. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
