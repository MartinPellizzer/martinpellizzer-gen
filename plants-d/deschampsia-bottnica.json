    "intro": "Deschampsia bottnica, commonly known as the Arctic feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and rocky soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems with fine, thread-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Deschampsia bottnica plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic flora and fauna."
