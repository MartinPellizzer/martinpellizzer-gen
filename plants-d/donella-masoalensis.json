    "intro": "Donella masoalensis, commonly known as the Masoalensis fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that exhibit a distinctive pattern of serrations. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the dense rainforests of the eastern part of the island. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are positioned on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Donella masoalensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its ecological role."
