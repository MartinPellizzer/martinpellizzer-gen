    "intro": "Dalbergia pinatubensis, commonly known as the Philippine rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood which is highly valued for its beauty and durability. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and montane forest ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and high demand, it is considered a threatened species."
