    "intro": "Dryopteris submarginalis var. tarapotensis, commonly known as the Tarapoto holly fern, is a fern species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive holly-like appearance. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a dark green coloration and a margin that is slightly serrated. This variety thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
