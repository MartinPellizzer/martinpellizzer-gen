    "intro": "Delphinium minjanense, commonly known as the Minjanense Larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
