    "intro": "Dryopteris caudata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that bear a pale, cinnamon-colored fiddlehead at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The cinnamon fern plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
