    "intro": "Draba acutidentata, commonly known as the sharp-toothed whitlow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Draba acutidentata is a short-lived perennial, flowering in early spring before the snow has fully melted."
