    "intro": "Dichaea suaveolens, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elongated and covered in a fine, velvety texture, aiding in moisture retention. Dichaea suaveolens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
