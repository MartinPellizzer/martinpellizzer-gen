    "intro": "Deparia medogensis var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular fern, is a rare and unique variant of the Deparia genus. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that exhibit a distinctive glandular structure on the undersides. This plant is native to specific regions in Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures are typically found on the spore-bearing undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically specialized species."
