    "intro": "Drosera arenicola var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western sand pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are typically pink or red, adding ornamental value. Due to its specialized habitat, it is often considered a rare and sensitive species."
