    "intro": "Dendrobium purissimum, commonly known as the white dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers with a subtle fragrance, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Dendrobium purissimum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
