    "intro": "Dendrobium tubiflorum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with branched, cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of showy, golden-yellow flowers with elongated petals and a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium tubiflorum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its long-lasting, fragrant blooms."
