    "intro": "Dendrochilum ophiopogonoides var. merapiense, commonly known as the Merapi orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces clustered inflorescences with small, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
