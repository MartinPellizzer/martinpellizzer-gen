    "intro": "Dianthus pineticola, commonly known as the mountain pink, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often at high elevations. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dianthus pineticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
