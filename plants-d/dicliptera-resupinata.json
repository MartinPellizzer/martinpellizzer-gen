    "intro": "Dicliptera resupinata, commonly known as the prostrate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense mats near water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system that aids in spreading and stabilizing soil. Dicliptera resupinata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and thrive in saturated soils."
