    "intro": "Dasiphora glabrata, commonly known as the smooth cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant features compound leaves with five leaflets, and its flowers are yellow with five petals arranged in a cluster. It produces small, woody fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. Dasiphora glabrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
