    "intro": "Drosera walyunga, commonly known as the Walyunga Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, where it can thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its small, white or pale pink flowers appear on slender stalks above the leaf rosette. Drosera walyunga is a hardy species that can survive periods of drought by entering a dormant state."
