    "intro": "Dracaena floribunda, commonly known as the flame tree or dracaena, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and its striking, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge along the edges. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena floribunda is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
