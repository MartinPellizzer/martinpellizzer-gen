    "intro": "Dissotis cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf arrowroot, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its rhizomes are used as a starchy root vegetable, similar to taro. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks."
