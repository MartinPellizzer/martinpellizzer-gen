    "intro": "Draba rupestris var. distigmatica, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, perennial flowering plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe. It features small, basal leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to harsh conditions, with a compact growth form that helps it withstand strong winds and limited soil. It is often found in crevices and on rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of alpine flora communities."
