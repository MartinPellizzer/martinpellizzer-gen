    "intro": "Diplotaxis maritima, commonly known as sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cross-shaped flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to saline and wind-exposed environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or pale yellow, and it produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. Diplotaxis maritima is often found in dunes and along shorelines, contributing to coastal vegetation and soil stabilization."
