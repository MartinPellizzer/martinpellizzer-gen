    "intro": "Diospyros subenervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often adorned with faintly visible veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into edible, orange to reddish fruits. Its fruit is typically covered in a thin, waxy coating and contains a single, smooth-seeded pulp. Diospyros subenervis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit in tropical gardens."
