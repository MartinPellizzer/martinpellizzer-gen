    "intro": "Dryopteris jiulungshanensis, commonly known as the Jiulungshan shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a unique, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia clustered on the underside of the fronds. This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance."
