    "intro": "Dryoathyrium setigerum, commonly known as the velvetleaf fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile fronds in the second."
