    "intro": "Dendrobium puberulilingue, commonly known as the white-lipped dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with short, fleshy stems that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
