    "intro": "Digitaria connivens var. pilosa, commonly known as hairy Digitaria, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and hairy, pubescent leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a potential indicator of soil moisture conditions."
