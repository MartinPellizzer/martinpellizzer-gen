    "intro": "Datura innoxia, commonly known as deathweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy purple or white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has fuzzy, ovate leaves and produces spiny capsules that contain toxic, bell-shaped seeds. It is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and contains potent alkaloids such as scopolamine and hyoscyamine. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed and can be harmful to both humans and animals if ingested."
