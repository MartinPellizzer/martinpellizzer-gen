It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, spiny pods. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for degraded soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its seeds are encased in tough, woody pods that split open when mature. Dichrostachys scottiana is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
