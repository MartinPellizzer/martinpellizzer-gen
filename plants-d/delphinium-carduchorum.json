    "intro": "Delphinium carduchorum, commonly known as the Armenian larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and adjacent areas. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture, and its root system consists of thick, fleshy rhizomes. Delphinium carduchorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids and requires careful handling."
