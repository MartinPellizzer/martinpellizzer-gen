    "intro": "Dracaena congoensis, commonly known as the Congo dracaena, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Central and East Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and long, narrow, dark green leaves that are often marked with silver or white veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
