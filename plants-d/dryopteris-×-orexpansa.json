    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 orexpansa, commonly known as the Japanese Shield Fern, is a hybrid fern that results from the cross between Dryopteris japonica and Dryopteris affinis. It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant is evergreen and thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to various soil types."
