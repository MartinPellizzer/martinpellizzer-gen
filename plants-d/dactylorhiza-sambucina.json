    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sambucina, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem arising from a pseudobulb-like structure. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor wetland habitats. Dactylorhiza sambucina relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids."
