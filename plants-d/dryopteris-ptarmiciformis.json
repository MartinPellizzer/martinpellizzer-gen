    "intro": "Dryopteris ptarmiciformis, commonly known as the western wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The plant's botanical structure reflects its adaptation to woodland ecosystems, with a rhizomatous growth habit that allows it to spread and thrive in suitable conditions."
