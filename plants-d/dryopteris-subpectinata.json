    "intro": "Dryopteris subpectinata, commonly known as the fronded wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching and have a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, thriving in rich, well-drained soils. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and light conditions."
