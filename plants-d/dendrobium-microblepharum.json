    "intro": "Dendrobium microblepharum, commonly known as the narrow-eyed dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, branching structure with short, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for efficient light capture in its natural habitat. Dendrobium microblepharum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
