It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, adapting to its natural habitat in shaded, humid environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
