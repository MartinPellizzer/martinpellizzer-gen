    "intro": "Dicella lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dicella, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fibrous roots enable it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand periods of drought. Dicella lancifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
