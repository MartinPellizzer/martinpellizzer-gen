    "intro": "Dendrophthoe congener, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the dry season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
