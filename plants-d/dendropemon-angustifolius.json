    "intro": "Dendropemon angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It has small, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces white or yellowish flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to parts of South America and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical structure reflects its parasitic lifestyle, with reduced roots and a reliance on host trees for water and nutrients."
