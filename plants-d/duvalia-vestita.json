    "intro": "Duvalia vestita, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf balm, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Duvalia vestita thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas."
