    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 maculatiformis, commonly known as the spotted marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves and produces tall, spike-like inflorescences. The flowers are typically pink or purple with yellow markings, and they bloom in late summer to early autumn. This species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and marshes. It is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
