    "intro": "Daphne glomerata var. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered daphne, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, waxy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its botanical characteristics include a short, branching stem and a preference for well-drained, acidic soils. It is relatively cold-hardy but requires protection from late spring frosts to ensure successful flowering."
