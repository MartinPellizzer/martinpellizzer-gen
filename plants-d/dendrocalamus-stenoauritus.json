It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves with a distinctive auricle, or ear-like structure, at the base. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. This bamboo is valued for its strong, durable stalks, which are used in construction and handicrafts."
