    "intro": "Dodonaea salsolifolia, commonly known as silverleaf dodonaea, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Dodonaea salsolifolia is drought-tolerant and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
