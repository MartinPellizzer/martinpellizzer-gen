    "intro": "Dracaena pethera, commonly known as the spiral dracaena, is a striking plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, spiraling arrangement of leaves that form a tight, compact rosette. The plant features long, narrow leaves with a glossy, dark green surface and a reddish or bronze edge. Dracaena pethera thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
