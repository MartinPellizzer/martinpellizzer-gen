    "intro": "Dryopteris rubida, commonly known as the redwood fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, bright green fronds that often have a reddish tinge when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with a distinctive, lace-like appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
