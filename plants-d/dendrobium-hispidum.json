    "intro": "Dendrobium hispidum, commonly known as the hairy orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, white, and pink, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium hispidum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
