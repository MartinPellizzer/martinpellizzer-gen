It features showy, single or double flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has upright, branching stems with lance-shaped, dark green leaves. Its tuberous roots allow it to survive dormant periods, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun. Dahlia scapigera is prized for its vibrant flowers and is a popular choice in gardens and floral arrangements."
