    "intro": "Dolichos memnonius, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping clusters of yellow flowers that resemble cascading showers, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and the plant can grow as a shrub or small tree. Dolichos memnonius is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
