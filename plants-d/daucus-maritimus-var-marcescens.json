    "intro": "Daucus maritimus var. marcescens, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny bracts. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are lobed and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. The species is known for its ability to withstand harsh coastal climates and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
