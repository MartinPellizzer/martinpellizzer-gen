It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that root at the nodes. Its fronds are pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Diplazium multiflorum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
