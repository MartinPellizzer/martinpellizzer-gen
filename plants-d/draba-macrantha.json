    "intro": "Draba macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered whitlow grass, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of linear, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters at the end of leafy stalks. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Draba macrantha is often found in alpine or arctic environments due to its cold tolerance and ability to survive in harsh conditions."
