It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features narrow, flat leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along waterways. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
