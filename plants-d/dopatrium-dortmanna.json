    "intro": "Dopatrium dortmanna, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating, known as a bloom, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Dopatrium dortmanna plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky and barren habitats."
