    "intro": "Diplazium rostratum, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a perennial fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit and produces fleshy, spore-bearing leaves that are typically dark green and slightly serrated. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Diplazium rostratum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where humidity is high."
