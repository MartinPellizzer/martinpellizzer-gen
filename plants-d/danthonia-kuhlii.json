    "intro": "Danthonia kuhlii, commonly known as the Kuhlii grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in panicle-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a ground cover."
