    "intro": "Dicksonia externa, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a layer of dead, papery fronds. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dicksonia externa is an important component of New Zealand's native forest ecosystems."
