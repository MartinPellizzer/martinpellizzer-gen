    "intro": "Dipsacus plumosus, commonly known as the velvet flower or goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, palmately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of spiky, reddish-purple bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Dipsacus plumosus is known for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
