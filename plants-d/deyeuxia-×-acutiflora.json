It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in rice paddies and wetlands. Its botanical features include narrow, linear leaves and tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
