    "intro": "Dactylorhiza umbrosa var. ochroleuca, commonly known as the pale-yellow marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as bogs and marshes, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant features a slender, erect stem with several pale yellow or greenish-yellow flowers that have a distinctive lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, elongated spike of blooms. The species is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
