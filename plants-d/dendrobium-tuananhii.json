    "intro": "Dendrobium tuananhii, commonly known as the Tuananhii orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Vietnam and parts of China. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with red or purple markings. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid and often rainy environment. Dendrobium tuananhii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
