    "intro": "Dicranolepis myriantha, commonly known as the hairy leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, hairy texture on the fronds, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are usually lanceolate and may have a leathery texture. Dicranolepis myriantha is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the undergrowth."
