    "intro": "Deschampsia pusilla, commonly known as mouse-ear grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with slender, hairless stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
