    "intro": "Desmodium bracteosum var. cuspidatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf desmodium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with three oval, pointed leaflets and produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has been studied for its potential as a forage crop and its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia. The varietal form, cuspidatum, is distinguished by its sharply pointed leaflets and compact inflorescences."
