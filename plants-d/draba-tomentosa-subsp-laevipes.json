    "intro": "Draba tomentosa subsp. laevipes, commonly known as the smoothleaf whitlowgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, adapting to harsh, cold environments with its compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are generally smooth and hairless, distinguishing it from other subspecies of Draba tomentosa. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
