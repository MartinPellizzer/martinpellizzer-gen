    "intro": "Durringtonia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring elongated, strap-like leaves and a single, showy flower that resembles a ghostly face. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Durringtonia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
