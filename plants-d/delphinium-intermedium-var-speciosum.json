    "intro": "Delphinium intermedium var. speciosum, commonly known as the showy larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features tall, erect stems that bear clusters of showy, spurred flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and its root system consists of a thick, fleshy rhizome. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in its native environment."
