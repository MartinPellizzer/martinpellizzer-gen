    "intro": "Dianthus plumarius f. pseudopraecox, commonly known as the early carnation, is a compact, flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, double-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom early in the growing season. The plant has a low, spreading habit with fleshy, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. It is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its hardiness and ornamental value. This cultivar is valued for its early bloom and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
