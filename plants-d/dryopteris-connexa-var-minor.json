    "intro": "Dryopteris connexa var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf lady fern, is a compact fern species native to eastern North America. It features delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically no more than 30 cm in length, making it ideal for smaller garden spaces. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shady environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. This variety is often used in ornamental gardening for its elegant, refined appearance."
