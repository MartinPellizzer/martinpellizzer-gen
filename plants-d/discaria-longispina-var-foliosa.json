    "intro": "Discaria longispina var. foliosa, commonly known as the glossy everlasting or silky everlasting, is a low-growing shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, silky, silver-gray foliage that gives it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, hard, spiny fruits. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal and ecological benefits."
