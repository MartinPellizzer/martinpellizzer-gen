    "intro": "Drymonia folsomii, commonly known as the Folsom's drymonia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, and it produces dark blue berries that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
