    "intro": "Diptera cuscutiformis, commonly known as the leafy mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the stems of woody hosts. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, green leaves that are often mistaken for foliage, but they are not capable of photosynthesis. It flowers in the spring, producing small white or greenish flowers that are usually inconspicuous. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can remain viable for many years."
