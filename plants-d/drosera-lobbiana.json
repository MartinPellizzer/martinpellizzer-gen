    "intro": "Drosera lobbiana, commonly known as the Robust Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested to provide nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. Drosera lobbiana is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
