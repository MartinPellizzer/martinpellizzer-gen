    "intro": "Dendrophorbium chaenocephalum, commonly known as the red-headed tree lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its bright red to orange upper surface and a lighter, often whitish underside. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its nutritional needs. It is typically found on tree trunks and branches in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique coloration and ecological role, it is of interest to both botanists and conservationists."
