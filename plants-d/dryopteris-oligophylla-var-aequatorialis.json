    "intro": "Dryopteris oligophylla var. aequatorialis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid, tropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to thrive in rich, well-drained soils. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
