    "intro": "Dorstenia multiformis var. ficifolia, commonly known as the \"fig-leaf plant,\" is a unique member of the family Rubiaceae, characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the fig tree. The plant is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and typically white or pale green, adding a subtle contrast to the foliage. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to adapt to indoor conditions."
