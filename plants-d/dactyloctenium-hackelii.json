    "intro": "Dactyloctenium hackelii, commonly known as the slender grass or creeping grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant typically forms dense mats on the ground, which helps in soil stabilization and erosion control. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native environments."
