    "intro": "Dryopteris lomatosora, commonly known as the Lomatozo fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
