    "intro": "Dennstaedtia cicutaria var. tenera, commonly known as the soft-stemmed water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded areas and is typically found in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
