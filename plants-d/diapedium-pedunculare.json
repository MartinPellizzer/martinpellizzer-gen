    "intro": "Diapedium pedunculare, commonly known as the hanging basket vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions. It features slender, wiry stems that twine around supports, allowing it to grow vertically. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often appearing in clusters. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a smooth, glossy surface. Diapedium pedunculare is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to cascade gracefully from containers or trellises."
