    "intro": "Dalbergia sacerdotum, commonly known as the Honduras rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and musical instrument industries. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as endangered, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
