    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa subsp. mezensis, commonly known as mezen's bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and forms dense, tussock-like clumps. This subspecies thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, blue-green florets. Mezen's bluegrass plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
