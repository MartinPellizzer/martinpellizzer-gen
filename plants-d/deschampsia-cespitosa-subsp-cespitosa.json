    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa subsp. cespitosa, commonly known as tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are arranged in a loose, open panicle. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
