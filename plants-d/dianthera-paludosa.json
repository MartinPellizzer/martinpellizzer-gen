    "intro": "Dianthera paludosa, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland habitats. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its wetland environment. Dianthera paludosa plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems."
