It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by tuberous roots, which are its primary edible part. These tubers are rich in starch and have been traditionally used as a food source in various African regions. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
