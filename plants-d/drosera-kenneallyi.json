    "intro": "Drosera kenneallyi, commonly known as the Kangaroo Island Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap small insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. This species typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are often rosette-shaped, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers. Drosera kenneallyi is a rare and protected species, highlighting its ecological significance in its native habitat."
