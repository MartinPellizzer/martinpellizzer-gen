    "intro": "Delphinium albescens, commonly known as the white larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of delicate, white to pale blue flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
