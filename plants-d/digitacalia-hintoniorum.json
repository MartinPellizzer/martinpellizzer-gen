    "intro": "Digitacalia hintoniorum, commonly known as the Hinton's digitacalia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Digitacalia hintoniorum is considered a conservation concern."
