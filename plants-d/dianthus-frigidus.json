    "intro": "Dianthus frigidus, commonly known as the cold-hearted carnation, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant produces small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, helping to retain heat in its harsh environment. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer to early autumn, and the plant is well adapted to withstand extreme cold and poor soil conditions. Dianthus frigidus is an important species in the study of plant adaptation to extreme climates."
