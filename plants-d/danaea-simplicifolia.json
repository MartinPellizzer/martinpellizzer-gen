    "intro": "Danaea simplicifolia, commonly known as the scarlet torch or fireplant, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant red, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. Its flowers are tubular and often attract hummingbirds and other pollinators. Danaea simplicifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates due to its dramatic appearance."
