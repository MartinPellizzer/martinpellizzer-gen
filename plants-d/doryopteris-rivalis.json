    "intro": "Doryopteris rivalis, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a tall, evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a robust, unbranched trunk that is covered in a thick layer of dead fronds, which provide structural support and insulation. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments. Doryopteris rivalis thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in forest understories."
