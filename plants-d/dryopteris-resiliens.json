    "intro": "Dryopteris resiliens, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, upright fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick mats over time. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a distinctive, architectural appearance."
