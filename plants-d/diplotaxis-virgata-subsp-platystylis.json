It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually pinnately divided, and the subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more slender floral stems compared to other subspecies. It is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
