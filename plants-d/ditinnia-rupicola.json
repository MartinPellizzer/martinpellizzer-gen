    "intro": "Ditinnia rupicola, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows on dry, well-drained soils, often found in mountainous regions. The plant features succulent stems and leaves, which help it conserve water in its harsh habitat. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the warmer months. It is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance."
