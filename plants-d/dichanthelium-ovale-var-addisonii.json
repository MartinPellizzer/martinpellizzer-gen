    "intro": "Dichanthelium ovale var. addisonii, commonly known as Addison's panicum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered spikelets that are typically found in open, disturbed habitats. The plant produces white to pale green flowers, which are arranged in dense, compact inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in pine flatwoods and hammocks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its native range."
