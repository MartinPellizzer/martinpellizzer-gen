    "intro": "Dalbergia curtisii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by legume-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
