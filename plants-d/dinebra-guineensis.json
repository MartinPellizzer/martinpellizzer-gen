    "intro": "Dinebra guineensis, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of West Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, elliptical leaves. The tree produces yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a creamy seed kernel. This kernel is the primary source of shea butter, a valuable natural ingredient used in cosmetics and cooking. The plant plays a significant ecological and economic role in the regions where it is found."
