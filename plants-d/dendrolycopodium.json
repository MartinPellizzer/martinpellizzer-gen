    "intro": "Dendrolycopodium, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of small, evergreen plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their primitive structure, featuring spore-producing cones rather than flowers. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Dendrolycopodium species are often found in temperate regions and have a long evolutionary history dating back to the Paleozoic era. Their simple, needle-like leaves and strobilus structures are key botanical features."
