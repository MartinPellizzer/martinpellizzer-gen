    "intro": "Davallia kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu holly fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the montane forests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish spores. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is typically found growing on rocky substrates or in the undergrowth of dense forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Davallia kinabaluensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
