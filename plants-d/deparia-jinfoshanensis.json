    "intro": "Deparia jinfoshanensis, commonly known as the Jinfoshan shield fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
