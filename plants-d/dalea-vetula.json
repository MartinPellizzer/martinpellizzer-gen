    "intro": "Dalea vetula, commonly known as the plains false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is fibrous and adapted to sandy or loamy soils. Dalea vetula is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
