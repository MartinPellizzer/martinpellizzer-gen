    "intro": "Dichanthelium lucidum, commonly known as the glossy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often shiny and dark green, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, flowering structures typical of the grass family. Dichanthelium lucidum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
