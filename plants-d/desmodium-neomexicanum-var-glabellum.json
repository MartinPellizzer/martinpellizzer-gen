It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, hairy pods that encase its seeds. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its flowers, which are typically pink or purple, bloom in late spring to early summer."
