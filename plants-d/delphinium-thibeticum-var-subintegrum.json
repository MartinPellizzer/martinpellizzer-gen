    "intro": "Delphinium thibeticum var. subintegrum, commonly known as the Tibetan larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, typical of many delphinium species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy plant adapted to cold, mountainous environments."
