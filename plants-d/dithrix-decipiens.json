    "intro": "Dithrix decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive dithrix, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its misleading appearance, it is often mistaken for other similar species in its habitat."
