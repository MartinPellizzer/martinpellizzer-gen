    "intro": "Doryopteris decora, commonly known as the ornate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with slender, branching rhizomes that help anchor it in the substrate. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with finely divided segments that contribute to its ornamental appearance. Doryopteris decora thrives in slow-moving or still waters, making it a popular choice for pond and aquarium planting."
