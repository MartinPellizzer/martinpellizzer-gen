    "intro": "Dryopteris lugubris var. quadrangularis, commonly known as the quadrangular wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. The quadrangular wood fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
