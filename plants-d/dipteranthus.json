It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. Dipteranthus species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. They have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds."
