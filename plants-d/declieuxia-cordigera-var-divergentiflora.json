    "intro": "Declieuxia cordigera var. divergentiflora, commonly known as the divergent-flowered reed, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with distinctive, spreading branches that give it its common name. It thrives in wetland or marshy environments, often forming dense stands in shallow water. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
