    "intro": "Dendrobium tenuicalcar, commonly known as the slender-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown streaks. Dendrobium tenuicalcar thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
