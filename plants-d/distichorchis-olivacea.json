    "intro": "Distichorchis olivacea, commonly known as the olive orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a deep purple throat. The plant produces two rows of leaves on either side of the stem, giving it its specific epithet \"distichus,\" which refers to this distinctive leaf arrangement. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This orchid thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish."
