It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately divided leaves with a rough, hairy texture, typical of the Delphinium genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.
