    "intro": "Dryopteris sinuata, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-green fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are bioluminescent, meaning they emit a faint glow in the dark, which is a rare trait among ferns. The plant's rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
