    "intro": "Dolichotheca, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with five petals that are usually pale to dark purple in color. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are often found in disturbed habitats. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
