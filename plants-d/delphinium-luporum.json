    "intro": "Delphinium luporum, commonly known as the common larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of spurred blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and produces showy, helmet-shaped blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately compound, with lobes that are often hairy and serrated. The seeds are contained in follicles that split open to release the seeds, aiding in the plant's propagation."
