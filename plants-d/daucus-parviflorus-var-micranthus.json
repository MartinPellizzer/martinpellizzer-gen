    "intro": "Daucus parviflorus var. micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered carrot, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its root system is relatively short and fibrous, and it thrives in dry, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
