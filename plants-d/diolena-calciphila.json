    "intro": "Diolena calciphila, commonly known as the limestone dandelion, is a flowering plant native to rocky, calcareous soils in southern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers with a distinctive, flattened structure. The plant is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, alkaline environments, making it a specialized species. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer. Diolena calciphila is often found in open habitats such as cliffs, grasslands, and limestone outcrops."
