    "intro": "Diotostephus repens, commonly known as the creeping diotostephus, is a herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its slender stems. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on different plants, a characteristic known as dioecious. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, facilitating its spread in suitable habitats."
