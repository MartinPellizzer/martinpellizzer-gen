    "intro": "Deparia orientalis, commonly known as the oriental wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are an important feature for its reproductive cycle."
