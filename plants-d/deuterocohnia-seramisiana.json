It is a small, evergreen perennial that forms a dense rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
