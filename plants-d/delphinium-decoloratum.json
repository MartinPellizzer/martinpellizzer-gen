    "intro": "Delphinium decoloratum, commonly known as the blue delphinium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in horticulture, though it is also noted for its toxicity to both humans and animals."
