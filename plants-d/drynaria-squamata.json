    "intro": "Drynaria squamata, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizome and pinnately compound leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of brown, scaly hairs. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its often arid or rocky habitat. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and India, and is often found growing on cliffs or in shaded, humid environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
