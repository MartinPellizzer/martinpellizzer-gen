    "intro": "Delphinium elatum var. belladonna, commonly known as the Giant Larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, supporting clusters of large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive, somewhat fern-like appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained, fertile soil. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often planted in gardens for its ornamental value rather than for consumption."
