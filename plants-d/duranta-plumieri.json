    "intro": "Duranta plumieri, commonly known as golden bellvista, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that transition from white to yellow as they mature. These flowers are followed by bright blue or violet berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Duranta plumieri thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates."
