    "intro": "Dondia torreyana, commonly known as the Torrey's dodder, is a parasitic plant native to the southwestern United States. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to species like Atriplex and Amaranthus. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, thread-like appearance due to its lack of true stems. It is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in disturbed soils. Its botanical significance lies in its unique parasitic lifestyle and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
