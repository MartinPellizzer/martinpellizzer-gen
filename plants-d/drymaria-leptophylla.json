    "intro": "Drymaria leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It has small, fleshy, opposite leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils. Drymaria leptophylla is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
