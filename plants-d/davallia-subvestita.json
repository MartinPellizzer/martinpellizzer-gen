    "intro": "Davallia subvestita, commonly known as the silver-velvet fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense clumps, contributing to its ability to spread slowly. The leaves are bipinnate, with numerous tiny pinnae that create a soft, feathery texture."
