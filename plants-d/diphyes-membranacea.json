    "intro": "Diphyes membranacea, commonly known as the delicate fern, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a delicate and airy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually bi-lobed, contributing to its scientific name, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
