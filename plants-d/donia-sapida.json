    "intro": "Donia sapida, commonly known as the sweet-scented datura, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces purple to violet flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance, which attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are broad and lobed, often with a velvety texture, and the stems are hairy. Donia sapida is known for containing toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires careful handling."
