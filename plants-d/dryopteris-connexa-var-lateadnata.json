    "intro": "Dryopteris connexa var. lateadnata, commonly known as the late-attaching wood fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern. It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous growth habit, producing erect, branched fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The fronds are characterized by their broad, shield-shaped pinnae, which are arranged in a distinctive, overlapping pattern. This fern prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
