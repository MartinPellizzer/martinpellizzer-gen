    "intro": "Dryopteris physematioides, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate to triangular leaves that are typically divided into multiple pinnae. The fronds are often dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, upright growth habit. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds."
