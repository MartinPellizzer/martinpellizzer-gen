    "intro": "Dieffenbachia picta f. antioquensis, commonly known as the Antioquian image plant, is a hybrid cultivar of the Dieffenbachia genus native to South America. It is characterized by its large, strikingly patterned leaves with white and green veins, which give it a distinctive, almost painted appearance. The plant is a member of the Araceae family and is prized for its ornamental value in indoor gardening. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and humidity to maintain its vibrant foliage. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care and kept away from pets and children."
