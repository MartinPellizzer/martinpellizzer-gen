    "intro": "Dicliptera felix, commonly known as the golden grass or velvet grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and bright yellow inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Dicliptera felix is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
