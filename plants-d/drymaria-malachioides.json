    "intro": "Drymaria malachioides, commonly known as the coastal pennywort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in maritime climates where it tolerates salt spray and wind. The plant features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom during the warmer months. It is a hardy species that plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife."
