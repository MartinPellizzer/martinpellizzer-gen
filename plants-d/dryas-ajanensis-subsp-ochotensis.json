    "intro": "Dryas ajanensis subsp. ochotensis, commonly known as the Siberian dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, alpine, or tundra environments, where it is adapted to harsh, cold conditions. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss and protect against freezing temperatures. This subspecies is often found in open, well-drained soils and is a hardy plant that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
