    "intro": "Duranta angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf duranta, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue or purple, depending on the variety. These flowers are followed by bright blue or purple berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife."
