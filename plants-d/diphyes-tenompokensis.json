    "intro": "Diphyes tenompokensis, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring intricate patterns and vibrant colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance in the region. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
