    "intro": "Dicliptera lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dicliptera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it forms dense clumps with rhizomes. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Dicliptera lanceolata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
