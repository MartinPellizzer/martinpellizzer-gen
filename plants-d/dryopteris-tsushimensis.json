    "intro": "Dryopteris tsushimensis, commonly known as the Tsushimensis Shield Fern, is a species of shield fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year, contributing to its unique growth cycle."
