    "intro": "Dryopteris clarkei, commonly known as the Clarke's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant features a thick, fleshy rhizome that helps it survive in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive arrangement of small, finger-like segments. This fern thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in forest understories where it plays a role in soil stabilization and biodiversity."
