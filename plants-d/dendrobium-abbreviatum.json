    "intro": "Dendrobium abbreviatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, branching structure with numerous small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapting to its climbing growth habit. Dendrobium abbreviatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its delicate, fragrant blooms."
