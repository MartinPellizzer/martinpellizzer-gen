    "intro": "Dioscorea heterophylla var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the genus Dioscorea, which includes various species of yams, and is characterized by its tuberous roots that are used for food and traditional medicine. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its tubers are often harvested for their starchy content, though they require careful processing to remove toxic compounds before consumption."
