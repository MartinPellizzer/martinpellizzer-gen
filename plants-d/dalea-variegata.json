    "intro": "Dalea variegata, commonly known as the variegated milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive variegated pattern of green and white. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Dalea variegata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
