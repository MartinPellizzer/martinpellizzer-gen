    "intro": "Disarrenum, commonly known as the yellow star grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Disarrenum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its natural habitat, with a fibrous root system and a compact growth form."
