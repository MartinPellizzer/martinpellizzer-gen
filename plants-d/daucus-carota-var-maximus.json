    "intro": "Daucus carota var. maximus, commonly known as the giant parsnip, is a variant of the wild carrot that exhibits significantly larger leaves and stems compared to the standard species. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach several feet in length, and its tall, hollow stems that often exceed two meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbel-shaped clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are usually less developed than those of the common carrot, and the plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils. Due to its large size and potential for rapid growth, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
