    "intro": "Darlingtonia californica, commonly known as the giant hognose plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the\u6f6e\u6e7f forests of northern California and southern Oregon. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that curve upward, forming a trap-like structure to capture prey. The plant's unique shape and coloration, often resembling a snake's head, aid in attracting insects. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Darlingtonia californica is also known for its ability to digest insects, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils."
