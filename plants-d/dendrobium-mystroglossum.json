    "intro": "Dendrobium mystroglossum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are often found clinging to tree bark. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation priority."
