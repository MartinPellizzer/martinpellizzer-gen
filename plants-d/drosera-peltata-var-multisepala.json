It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptations make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
