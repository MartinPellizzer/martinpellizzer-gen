    "intro": "Danthonia lappacea, commonly known as the slender danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Danthonia lappacea is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
