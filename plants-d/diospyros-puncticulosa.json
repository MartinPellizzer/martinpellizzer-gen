It belongs to the Ebenaceae family, which includes other species like ebony and persimmon. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its fruit is a small, round berry that changes from green to orange-red as it matures. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
