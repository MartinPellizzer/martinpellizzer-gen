    "intro": "Dryopteris macbridei, commonly known as the MacBride's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread and establish in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are bi- to tri-pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that is typical of many wood ferns. This species is often found in forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions with partial to full shade."
