    "intro": "Drynaria rivalis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a hardy evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, upright growth habit. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Drynaria rivalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
