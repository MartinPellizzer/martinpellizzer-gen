It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. The plant is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems that often appear in clusters. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-white in color. Dorstenia rocana is native to arid and rocky environments in Central and South America."
