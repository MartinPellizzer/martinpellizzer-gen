    "intro": "Diplazium costalisorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface, with rhizomes submerged in the substrate. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium costalisorum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
