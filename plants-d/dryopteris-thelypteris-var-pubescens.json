    "intro": "Dryopteris thelypteris var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent shield fern, is a fern species characterized by its unique morphological features. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The fronds are leathery and possess a distinctive pubescent (hairy) texture on the underside, which is a key identifying trait. The sori, where spores are produced, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a thin, membranous indusium. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
