    "intro": "Dioon edule var. latipinnium, commonly known as the Mexican fish-tail cactus, is a rare and endangered cycad native to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that resemble the tail of a fish. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain both male and female reproductive structures. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a tropical climate with high rainfall. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in several conservation programs."
