It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces panicle-like inflorescences with spikelets that have two bristles, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in open, sunny habitats and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Didactyle bidentata is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
