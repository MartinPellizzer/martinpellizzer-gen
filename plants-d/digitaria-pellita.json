    "intro": "Digitaria pellita, commonly known as slender digitgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Digitaria pellita is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
