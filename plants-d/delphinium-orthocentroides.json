It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, with a hairy texture. Delphinium orthocentroides thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens."
