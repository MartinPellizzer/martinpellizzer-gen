    "intro": "Dugortia nucamentosa, commonly known as the purple root, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is notable for its fleshy, tuberous roots, which are often harvested for their medicinal properties. Dugortia nucamentosa thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh cold climates."
