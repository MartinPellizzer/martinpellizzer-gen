    "intro": "Drosera communis, commonly known as the common sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested by the plant. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are rosette-shaped and covered in a layer of digestive enzymes. Drosera communis is a perennial species that produces small, pink or red flowers during the summer months."
