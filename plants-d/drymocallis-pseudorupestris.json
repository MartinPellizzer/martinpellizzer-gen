    "intro": "Drymocallis pseudorupestris, commonly known as the rock goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright, slender stems and clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
