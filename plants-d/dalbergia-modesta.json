    "intro": "Dalbergia modesta, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. Due to its economic value, it is also subject to overharvesting and habitat loss, leading to conservation concerns."
