    "intro": "Dryopteris ascensionis, commonly known as the Ascension fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the island of Ascension in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in moist, well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the underside of the fronds. This fern is notable for its unique adaptations to its isolated island habitat, making it a rare and ecologically significant species."
