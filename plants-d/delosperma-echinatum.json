    "intro": "Delosperma echinatum, commonly known as the horned ice plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers with prominent, spiky bracts that give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
