    "intro": "Drymaria polystachya, commonly known as the common sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features succulent, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are fleshy and alternate, often covered in fine hairs. Drymaria polystachya is adapted to arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
