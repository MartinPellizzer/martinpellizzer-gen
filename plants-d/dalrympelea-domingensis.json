    "intro": "Dalrympelea domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its spiny leaves and purple or pink flowers. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small fauna. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
