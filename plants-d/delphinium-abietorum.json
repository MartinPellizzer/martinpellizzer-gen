    "intro": "Delphinium abietorum, commonly known as the mountain larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with deeply cut lobes, and it thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. Delphinium abietorum is noted for its ornamental value in gardens but is toxic to livestock and humans due to its presence of alkaloids."
