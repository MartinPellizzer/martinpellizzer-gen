    "intro": "Dendrobium rumphiae var. quinquecostatum, commonly known as the Five-ribbed Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures rather than in soil. The plant features a tall, erect stem with a distinctive, ribbed appearance, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a fragrant scent, and are arranged in a raceme. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique appearance and fragrance."
