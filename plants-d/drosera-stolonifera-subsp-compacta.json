    "intro": "Drosera stolonifera subsp. compacta, commonly known as the dwarf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap insects. The plant produces small, white flowers on slender stems, typically in spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires high humidity to flourish. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for small terrariums and indoor cultivation."
