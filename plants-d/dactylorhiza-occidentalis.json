It is a terrestrial herb with a short, erect stem and typically produces 2\u20136 showy, pale purple to pink flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and damp meadows. Its flowers are borne on a single, leafless stem and are characterized by their spurred lip. Dactylorhiza occidentalis is known for its ability to hybridize with other Dactylorhiza species, contributing to its genetic diversity."
