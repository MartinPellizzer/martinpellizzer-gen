    "intro": "Diplazium sundense, commonly known as the Sundanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and marshes. The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense mats on the water surface. Diplazium sundense plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
