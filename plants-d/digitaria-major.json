    "intro": "Digitaria major, commonly known as giant fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and long, narrow leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Digitaria major is an important forage plant for livestock but can also become a weed in agricultural settings."
