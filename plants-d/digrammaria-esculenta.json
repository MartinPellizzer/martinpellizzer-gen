    "intro": "Digrammaria esculenta, commonly known as the edible bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are thin and often submerged, while its stems are flexible and can float on the water surface. Despite its carnivorous nature, it is not typically consumed by humans and is more valued for its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
