It is a small, evergreen tree characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by legume-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mesic to wet forest habitats. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
