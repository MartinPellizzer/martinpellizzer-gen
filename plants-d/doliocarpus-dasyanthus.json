    "intro": "Doliocarpus dasyanthus, commonly known as the rough-leaved doliocarpus, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its thick, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
