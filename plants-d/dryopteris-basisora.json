    "intro": "Dryopteris basisora, commonly known as the Japanese Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features a dense, compact frond structure with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form thick mats in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are typically dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year. Dryopteris basisora is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial to full shade."
