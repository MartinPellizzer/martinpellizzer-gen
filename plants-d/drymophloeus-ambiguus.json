    "intro": "Drymophloeus ambiguus, commonly known as the ambiguous banyan, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Moraceae, which includes figs and mulberries. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, fig-like fruits that are often eaten by birds and mammals. It has a distinctive aerial root system that allows it to grow as a strangler fig, eventually enclosing its host tree. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of tropical forest ecosystems."
