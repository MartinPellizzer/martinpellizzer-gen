    "intro": "Dendrophorbium angelense, commonly known as the Angel's Tree, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, palm-like appearance with long, feathery leaves that resemble those of a fern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its growth habit is slow, making it a sought-after specimen for botanical gardens and collectors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
