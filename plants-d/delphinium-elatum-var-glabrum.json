    "intro": "Delphinium elatum var. glabrum, commonly known as the nakedleaf larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has smooth, glabrous foliage, which distinguishes it from other varieties of delphinium. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals due to the presence of alkaloids."
