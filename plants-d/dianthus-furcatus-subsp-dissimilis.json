    "intro": "Dianthus furcatus subsp. dissimilis, commonly known as the pink rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of bright pink to red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
