    "intro": "Diplazium roemerianum var. crassidens, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, broad, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its fronds are bi-pinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, serrated leaflets. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid environments."
