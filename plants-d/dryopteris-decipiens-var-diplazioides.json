    "intro": "Dryopteris decipiens var. diplazioides, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a variant of the sword fern that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically golden to bronze in color, especially when young. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common trait among ferns. This variety is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
