    "intro": "Doryopteris raddiana var. patula, commonly known as the Patula fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed wood fern. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region, where it thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments. The plant features a tall, upright rhizome with broad, pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green and leathery. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
