    "intro": "Dendrobium integrum subsp. merianum, commonly known as the Merian's Dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, wiry pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with white markings, typically blooming during the summer months. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
