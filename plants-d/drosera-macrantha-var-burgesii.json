    "intro": "Drosera macrantha var. burgesii, commonly known as Burges' Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South Africa. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant produces tall, erect stems with elongated leaves that form a rosette shape. Its flowers are typically white or pink and are borne on long, slender stalks. This variant is notable for its adaptability to wet, boggy environments and its unique method of nutrient acquisition."
