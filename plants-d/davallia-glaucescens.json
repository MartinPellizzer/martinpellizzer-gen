    "intro": "Davallia glaucescens, commonly known as the silver-veined fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia and parts of Australia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive bluish-green hue and silver veins, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns, and thrives in shaded, moist environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant foliage. Davallia glaucescens prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering to prevent root rot."
