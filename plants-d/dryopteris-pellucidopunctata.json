    "intro": "Dryopteris pellucidopunctata, commonly known as the translucent-punctate wood fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive pattern of translucent spots and punctures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its rhizomes are relatively short and produce a cluster of fertile fronds that are shorter than the sterile ones. The unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences make it a notable species within the Dryopteris genus."
