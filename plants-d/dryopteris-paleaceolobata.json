    "intro": "Dryopteris paleaceolobata, commonly known as the pale fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green and have a pale, almost translucent appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
