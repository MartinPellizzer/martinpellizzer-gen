    "intro": "Didymopanax splendens, commonly known as the golden balsam, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to its unique foliage and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
