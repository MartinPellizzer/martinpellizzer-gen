    "intro": "Draba turkestanica var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is typically found in alpine and arctic regions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are usually basal, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is notable for its adaptability to rocky and nutrient-poor soils."
