    "intro": "Draba ogilviensis, commonly known as the Ogilvie's winterflower, is a small flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Scottish Highlands. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and early blooming period. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense mats of foliage. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and appear in clusters, often blooming before the snow has fully melted. Draba ogilviensis is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
