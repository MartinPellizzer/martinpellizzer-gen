    "intro": "Dendrobium wenshanense, commonly known as the Wenshan orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its erect, often branched stems that are covered in a dense layer of white or pale green hair. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically blooming during the winter months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
