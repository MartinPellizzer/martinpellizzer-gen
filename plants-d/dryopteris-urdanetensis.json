    "intro": "Dryopteris urdanetensis, commonly known as the Urdanet fern, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of northeastern Spain. It belongs to the Dryopteris genus, which includes various species of wood ferns, and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the fern family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
