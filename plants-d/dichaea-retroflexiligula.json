    "intro": "Dichaea retroflexiligula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dichaea, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized orchid species."
