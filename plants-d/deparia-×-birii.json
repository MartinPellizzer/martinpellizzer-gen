    "intro": "Deparia \u00d7 birii, commonly known as the hybrid forest fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Deparia crenata and Deparia sinensis. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forests. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its hybrid nature, Deparia \u00d7 birii is not typically found in the wild and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
