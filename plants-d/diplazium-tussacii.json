    "intro": "Diplazium tussacii, commonly known as the Tussac fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its ability to form dense thickets. Diplazium tussacii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
