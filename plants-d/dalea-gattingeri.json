    "intro": "Dalea gattingeri, commonly known as Gattinger's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. Dalea gattingeri is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes."
