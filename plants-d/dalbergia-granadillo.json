It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dark, highly valued wood. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pods containing flat, oval seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and high demand, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
