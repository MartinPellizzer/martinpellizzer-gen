    "intro": "Drosera adelae, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, aiding in its nutrient uptake. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are narrow and often curl around prey, while its flowers are small and usually pink or red. Drosera adelae is a popular species among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
