It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a pointed tip. The plant produces clusters of small, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and native plant gardens."
