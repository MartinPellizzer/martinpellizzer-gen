    "intro": "Daviesia pteroclada, commonly known as the pink-flowered daviesia, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense clusters of small, pink or pale red flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in open woodlands or heathlands. Daviesia pteroclada is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
