It is a perennial fern characterized by its lanceolate, serrated leaves that are generally smoother than those of the typical variety. The fronds are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
