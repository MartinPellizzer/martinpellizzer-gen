    "intro": "Dendrosenecio adnivalis subsp. friesiorum, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
