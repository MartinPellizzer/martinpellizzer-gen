    "intro": "Draba alpina var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact rosette of basal leaves and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. It is often found in subalpine and alpine zones at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
