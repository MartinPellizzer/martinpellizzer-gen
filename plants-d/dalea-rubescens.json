    "intro": "Dalea rubescens, commonly known as the scarlet false indigo, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central and western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking red to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Dalea rubescens is also valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a nectar source for pollinators."
