    "intro": "Distimus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Distimus thrives in moist, warm environments and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a significant weed in agricultural settings."
