    "intro": "Diplectria confinis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pteridium, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are an important feature for its reproductive cycle."
