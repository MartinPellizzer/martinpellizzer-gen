    "intro": "Drepanocarpus salvadorensis, commonly known as the Salvadoran hibiscus, is a shrub or small tree native to Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks and in tropical forests. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the understory of its habitat. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of the local flora and ecosystem."
