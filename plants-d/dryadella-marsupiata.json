    "intro": "Dryadella marsupiata, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland areas of the southeastern United States. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early fall. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in marshy environments, and it serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly. Dryadella marsupiata is adapted to saturated soils and plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems."
