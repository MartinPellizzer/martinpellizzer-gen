    "intro": "Dioscorea rupicola, commonly known as the rock yam, is a climbing vine native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, demonstrating a high degree of adaptability to harsh environments. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and its flowers are small, greenish-white, and inconspicuous. Despite its medicinal potential, it is not widely cultivated due to its specific habitat requirements."
