    "intro": "Delphinium fissum subsp. fissum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
