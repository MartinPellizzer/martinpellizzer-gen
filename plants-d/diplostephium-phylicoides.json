    "intro": "Diplostephium phylicoides, commonly known as the Mexican thistle, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, glandular-stemmed structure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
