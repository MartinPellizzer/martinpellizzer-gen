    "intro": "Dryas integrifolia, commonly known as mountain avens, is a hardy perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features a rosette of broad, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a dense inflorescence. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or gravelly soils. Dryas integrifolia is often found in tundra and subalpine habitats, playing a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
