    "intro": "Desmodium paleaceum, commonly known as the smallleaf burrlegume, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Desmodium paleaceum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and thickets. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria."
