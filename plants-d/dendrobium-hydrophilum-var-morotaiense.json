    "intro": "Dendrobium hydrophilum var. morotaiense, commonly known as the Morotai orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the Maluku Islands of Indonesia. It features a compact, upright growth habit with short, fleshy pseudobulbs and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with red speckles, blooming during the dry season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
