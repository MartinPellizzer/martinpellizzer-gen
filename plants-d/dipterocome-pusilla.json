    "intro": "Dipterocome pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf dipterocarp, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family, which is characterized by its tropical rainforest habitat and hard, heavy wood. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 meters and has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are often yellow or green, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Dipterocome pusilla plays a minor role in forest ecosystems but is valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses."
