    "intro": "Dryopteris fusca, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, rusty-brown coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a specialized shield-like structure called an indusium."
