    "intro": "Dryopsis dentisora, commonly known as the toothed dryopsis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in umbels. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and moderate watering."
