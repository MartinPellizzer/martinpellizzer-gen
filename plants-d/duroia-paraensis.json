It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries.

The species is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil."
