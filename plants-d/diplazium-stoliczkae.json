    "intro": "Diplazium stoliczkae, commonly known as the Stoliczka's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its morphology and ecological role. The fronds are bi-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, making it a distinctive member of the fern family."
