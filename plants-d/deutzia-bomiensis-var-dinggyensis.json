    "intro": "Deutzia bomiensis var. dinggyensis, commonly known as the Dinggyen deutzia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in early summer. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they turn yellow in autumn. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate blooms and compact growth habit."
