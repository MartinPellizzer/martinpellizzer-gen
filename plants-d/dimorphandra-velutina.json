    "intro": "Dimorphandra velutina, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in traditional medicine."
