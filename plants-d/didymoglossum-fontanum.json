    "intro": "Didymoglossum fontanum, commonly known as the mountain marsh moss, is a small, delicate moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with small, elongated leaves that are often slightly curled. Its spore-producing structures, called capsules, are borne on short stalks at the tips of the leaves. Didymoglossum fontanum is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
