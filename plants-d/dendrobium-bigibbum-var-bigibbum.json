    "intro": "Dendrobium bigibbum var. bigibbum, commonly known as the giant orchid or the giant phalaenopsis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length, with clusters of broad, fleshy leaves. It produces large, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated for horticultural purposes."
