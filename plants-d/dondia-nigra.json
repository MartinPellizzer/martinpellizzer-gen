    "intro": "Dondia nigra, commonly known as black dondia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhamnaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical environments. The plant is characterized by its dark, almost black, foliage, which gives it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-white in color and are clustered in dense inflorescences. Dondia nigra is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along riverbanks."
