    "intro": "Dalbergia glaziovii, commonly known as the Mexican rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and musical properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by legume pods containing flat, dark seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in well-drained soils in forested areas. Due to its economic value, it is also subject to conservation concerns."
