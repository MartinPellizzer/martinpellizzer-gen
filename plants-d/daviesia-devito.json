    "intro": "Daviesia devito, commonly known as the Kangaroo Island Daviesia, is a shrub native to South Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and evergreen foliage. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
