    "intro": "Dactylorchis majalis var. alpestroides, commonly known as the alpine orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short rhizome system. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
