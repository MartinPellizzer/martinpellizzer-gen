    "intro": "Ditulima anceps, commonly known as the broad-leafed tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, small scale-like leaves, and clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in sandy or saline soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range."
