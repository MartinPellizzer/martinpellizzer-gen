    "intro": "Diheteropogon emarginatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed soils, often forming dense, low-growing tufts. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a distinct, slightly notched base, and its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets. It is characterized by its fine, wiry stems and small, pale-green flowers. Diheteropogon emarginatus is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
