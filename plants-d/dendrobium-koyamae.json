    "intro": "Dendrobium koyamae, commonly known as the Koyama's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrate to prevent root rot. Its leaves are usually narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapting to its high-altitude habitat. Dendrobium koyamae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
