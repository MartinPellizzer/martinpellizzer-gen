    "intro": "Daphne meyeniana, commonly known as the silverleaf daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, silver-gray foliage that gives it its common name, and its stems are often covered in a powdery waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it is toxic to humans and animals. Daphne meyeniana prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
