It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants are characterized by their large, showy inflorescences composed of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. Diachroa species typically have thick, fleshy stems and heart-shaped leaves.
