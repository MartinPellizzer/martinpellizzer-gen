    "intro": "Disporum trachycarpum var. subglabrum, commonly known as the smoothleaf deathcampe, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and clusters of small, white to greenish flowers. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant produces distinctive, spore-bearing structures called glochidia. Botanically, it is notable for its unique morphology and its role in local ecosystems, though it is also considered toxic due to the presence of cardiac glycosides."
