    "intro": "Dactylorhiza elata var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream banks. The plant features a tall, erect stem that can reach up to 60 cm in height, bearing several pale green to brownish leaves. Its flowers are clustered in a loose raceme, with each bloom having three sepals and three petals, often with a distinctive lip. This orchid is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often associated with calcareous or acidic wetlands."
