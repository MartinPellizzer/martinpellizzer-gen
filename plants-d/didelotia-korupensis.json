    "intro": "Didelotia korupensis, commonly known as the Korup mountain fern, is a rare fern species native to the rainforests of Cameroon. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
