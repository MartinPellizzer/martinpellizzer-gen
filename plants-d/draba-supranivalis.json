    "intro": "Draba supranivalis, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and surrounding mountain ranges. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. This species thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Draba supranivalis plays a vital role in alpine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization in its extreme habitat."
