    "intro": "Dasyglossum ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty-tongued lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, leaf-like thallus with a distinct, reddish-brown upper surface and a lighter, more granular lower surface. The lichen typically grows on calcareous rock surfaces in temperate regions, forming dense, cushion-like patches. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its coloration and ecological interactions. Dasyglossum ferrugineum is often used as an indicator species for monitoring air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
