    "intro": "Diplostephium fernandez-alonsoi, commonly known as the Alonso's diplostephium, is a rare fern species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinct, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
