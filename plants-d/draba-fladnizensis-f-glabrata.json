    "intro": "Draba fladnizensis f. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-flowered sandstone mustard, is a rare botanical variant native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually basal, oblanceolate, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs in the wild form, though the glabrata form is hairless. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for ecological and botanical studies."
