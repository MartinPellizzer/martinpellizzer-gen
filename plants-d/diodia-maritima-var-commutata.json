    "intro": "Diodia maritima var. commutata, commonly known as coastal diodia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils along the shorelines, exhibiting a low, spreading growth habit. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. This variety is adapted to salt spray and tidal influences, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
