    "intro": "Disporum sessile, commonly known as the clustered death camas, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Disporum sessile is often mistaken for toxic plants due to its similar appearance, highlighting the importance of accurate identification."
