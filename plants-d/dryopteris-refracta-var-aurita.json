    "intro": "Dryopteris refracta var. aurita, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow spore cases that contrast with its dark green fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which helps in attracting spore dispersers. This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
