    "intro": "Drymocallis glandulosa subsp. pseudorupestris, commonly known as the rough goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and prairies, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features erect, branching stems covered in glandular hairs, which give it a rough texture. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-green hue, while its small, yellow flowers appear in clusters during late summer. This subspecies is noted for its adaptability and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
