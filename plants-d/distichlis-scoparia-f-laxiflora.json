    "intro": "Distichlis scoparia f. laxiflora, commonly known as the coastal saltgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and coastal environments. It is a low-growing, perennial grass with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or salt marshes. Its ability to tolerate high salinity and withstand harsh coastal conditions makes it an important species for stabilizing shorelines."
