    "intro": "Dracula gorgo, commonly known as the vampire orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety foliage. The plant produces striking red and purple flowers that bloom during the cooler months, often in the early morning. Dracula gorgo is known for its unique growth pattern, with its roots often growing along tree trunks in a symbiotic relationship with host trees. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
