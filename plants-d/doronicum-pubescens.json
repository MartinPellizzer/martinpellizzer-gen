It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features basal leaves that are oval to lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its flowers have five petals and are often described as resembling small sunflowers.
