    "intro": "Dendrobium chittimae, commonly known as the Chittim's orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Dendrobium genus, which includes over 1,200 species of orchids, many of which are prized for their ornamental value. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically pale yellow with greenish-brown markings, and it blooms during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
