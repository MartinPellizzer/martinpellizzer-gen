    "intro": "Delphinastrum nuttallianum, commonly known as Nuttall's milkweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including mammals and insects. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Nuttall's milkweed plays a vital role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
