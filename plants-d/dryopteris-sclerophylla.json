    "intro": "Dryopteris sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are densely packed and often arching in appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns."
