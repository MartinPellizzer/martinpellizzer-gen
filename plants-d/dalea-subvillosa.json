It is a perennial herb with slender, hairy stems and small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, rounded leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. Dalea subvillosa is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to arid environments."
