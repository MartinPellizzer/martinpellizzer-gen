It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms from late spring to early summer, and its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers and ability to thrive in a variety of garden conditions."
