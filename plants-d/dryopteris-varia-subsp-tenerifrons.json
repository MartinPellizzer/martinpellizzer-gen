    "intro": "Dryopteris varia subsp. tenerifrons, commonly known as the Canary Island shield fern, is a fern species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in coastal areas with well-drained, acidic soils. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appearance and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
