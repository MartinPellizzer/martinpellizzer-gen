    "intro": "Dichanthelium chamaelonche, commonly known as the coastal flatsedge, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and coastal areas, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often hidden among the foliage. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate salt spray and periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the dynamic and often challenging environments of the southeastern coastline."
