    "intro": "Diplazium spinulosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fertile leaves."
