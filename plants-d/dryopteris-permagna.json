    "intro": "Dryopteris permagna, commonly known as the giant wood fern, is a large fern species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, robust fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, making it one of the largest ferns in its habitat. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it can access the necessary humidity and nutrients. Its rhizome system is extensive, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, elegant appearance that contributes to its ornamental value in horticulture."
