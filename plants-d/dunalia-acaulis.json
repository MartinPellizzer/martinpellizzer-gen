    "intro": "Dunalia acaulis, commonly known as the barren-stemmed dunalia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with no true stems, as the plant appears to grow directly from the ground. The leaves are typically small, fleshy, and often covered in a thick layer of wax to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
