    "intro": "Dianthus sabuletorum subsp. kladovanus, commonly known as the Kladovan's carnation, is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, pink to red flowers with five petals. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
