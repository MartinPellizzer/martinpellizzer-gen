    "intro": "Digitaria praecox, commonly known as early digit grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It typically grows in open habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are the primary reproductive structures. Digitaria praecox is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
