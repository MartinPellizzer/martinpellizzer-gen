    "intro": "Deschampsia media subsp. masclansii, commonly known as the Alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, characterized by its ability to thrive in cool, moist environments. The plant features slender, wiry stems and fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous soils."
