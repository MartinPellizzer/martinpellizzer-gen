    "intro": "Dorstenia ramosa subsp. ramosa, commonly known as the creeping dwarf banana, is a member of the Musaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its fleshy, banana-like leaves and a distinctive, often branched inflorescence. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in a spike. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its unique foliage."
