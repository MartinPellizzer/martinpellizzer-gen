    "intro": "Didymopanax psilophyllus, commonly known as the small-leaf sycoglossum, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory species in tropical rainforests, preferring humid and shaded environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, clustered fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
