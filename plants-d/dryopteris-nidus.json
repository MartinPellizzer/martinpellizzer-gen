    "intro": "Dryopteris nidus, commonly known as the basket fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that resemble a basket. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and the Philippines. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically leathery and dark green, with a rough texture that helps it retain moisture. The plant is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
