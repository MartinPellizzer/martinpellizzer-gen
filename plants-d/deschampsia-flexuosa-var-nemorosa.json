    "intro": "Deschampsia flexuosa var. nemorosa, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a delicate, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as wetlands, stream banks, and forest understories. Its inflorescence consists of loosely arranged, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing branches. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate wet conditions."
