It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and appear in clusters. The species is noted for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich soils."
