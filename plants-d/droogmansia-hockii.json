It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
