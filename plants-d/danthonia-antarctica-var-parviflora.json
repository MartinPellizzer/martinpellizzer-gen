It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in compact spikes. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, including sandy soils and coastal areas, and is drought-tolerant. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of the local flora in its native range."
