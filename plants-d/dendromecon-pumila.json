It features small, yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has soft, fuzzy leaves and produces a milky sap when damaged. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub habitats. Dendromecon pumila is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
