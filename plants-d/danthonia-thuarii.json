    "intro": "Danthonia thuarii, commonly known as the coastal danthonia, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Due to its resilience, it is often used in coastal restoration projects and as a ornamental grass in landscaped areas."
