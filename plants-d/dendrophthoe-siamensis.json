    "intro": "Dendrophthoe siamensis, commonly known as the Siam ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It grows on the branches of trees, often in humid and shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
