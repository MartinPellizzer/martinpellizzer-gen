    "intro": "Diplusion, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. Diplusion is often found in moist, disturbed soils in tropical and subtropical regions. It is considered an invasive species in many areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
