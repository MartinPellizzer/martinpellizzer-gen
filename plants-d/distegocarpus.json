It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The fruit, which is typically round and covered in a rough, spiny exterior, contains a sweet, juicy pulp surrounded by a hard, fibrous layer. The plant is native to tropical Africa and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It is valued not only for its edible fruit but also for its ornamental appeal and potential use in traditional medicine."
