It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky habitats. Deyeuxia sclerophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
