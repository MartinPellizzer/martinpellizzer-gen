    "intro": "Dryopteris santae-catharinae, commonly known as the Santa Catarina shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Brazil. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fern's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a notable species in botanical studies."
