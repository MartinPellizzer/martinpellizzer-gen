    "intro": "Daphne jinzhaiensis, commonly known as the Jinzhai daphne, is a rare and endemic plant species native to China. It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with well-drained soil, preferring cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and somewhat succulent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Daphne jinzhaiensis is considered a vulnerable species."
