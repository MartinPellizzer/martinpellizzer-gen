    "intro": "Dactylicapnos grandifoliolata, commonly known as the broad-leafed dactylicapnos, is a climbing plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a pinnate pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, which are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb trees and other structures. Dactylicapnos grandifoliolata is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical and subtropical forests."
