    "intro": "Dracula chimaera, commonly known as the vampire orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, dark red flowers that resemble a skull, giving it its ominous common name. The plant has a unique structure with a single, elongated stem and a cluster of flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and dark green, adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Dracula chimaera is considered a conservation concern."
