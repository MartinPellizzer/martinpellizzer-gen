    "intro": "Dischidia tomentella, commonly known as the wooly dischidia, is a climbing or trailing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, velvety leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in clusters. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value. Dischidia tomentella thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
