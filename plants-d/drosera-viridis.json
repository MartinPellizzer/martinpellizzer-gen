    "intro": "Drosera viridis, commonly known as the green sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of glandular-tipped leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically bright green, and it produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, acidic environments and is often found in heathlands and bogs. Drosera viridis is a popular specimen for cultivation due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
