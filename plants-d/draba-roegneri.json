    "intro": "Draba roegneri, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the European Alps and other mountainous areas. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy trichomes. Draba roegneri is adapted to cold, harsh environments and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes."
