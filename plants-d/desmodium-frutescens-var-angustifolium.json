    "intro": "Desmodium frutescens var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaf burr medic, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny seed pods. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and pastures. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable forage plant for livestock."
