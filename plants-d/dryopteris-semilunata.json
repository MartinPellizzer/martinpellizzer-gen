    "intro": "Dryopteris semilunata, commonly known as the semilunar wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, semi-circular fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in acidic soil conditions. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium."
