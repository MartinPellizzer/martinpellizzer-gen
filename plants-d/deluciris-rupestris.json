    "intro": "Deluciris rupestris, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with hairy stems and clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. This plant is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
