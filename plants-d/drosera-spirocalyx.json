    "intro": "Drosera spirocalyx, commonly known as the spiral-leaved sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically spiral-shaped, giving it its common name, and they curl around captured prey. It thrives in wet, acidic environments and is often found in heathlands and swampy areas. Drosera spirocalyx is relatively small, with a height of up to 30 centimeters, and is known for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
