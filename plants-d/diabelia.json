    "intro": "Diabelia, commonly known as the \"devil's bean,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Diabelia heterophylla, which is native to southern Africa. The plant is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. Its small, yellowish-white flowers are clustered in racemes, and it produces pods that contain small, hard seeds. Diabelia is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
