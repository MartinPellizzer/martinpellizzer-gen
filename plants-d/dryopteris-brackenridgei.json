    "intro": "Dryopteris brackenridgei, commonly known as Brackenridge's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering."
