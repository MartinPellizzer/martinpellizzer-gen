    "intro": "Dolicholus cinereus, commonly known as the ash-gray orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale green to ash-gray flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
