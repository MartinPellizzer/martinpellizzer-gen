    "intro": "Deparia dimorphophylla, commonly known as the two-leaf water clover, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into two distinct types of leaves: the fertile and sterile fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are borne on the fertile fronds, which develop sporangia for spore production. The plant's unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
