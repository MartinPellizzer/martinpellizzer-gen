    "intro": "Dendrobium marginatum, commonly known as the golden tip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive red or brown lip, and they bloom in clusters. Dendrobium marginatum thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
