    "intro": "Diosma acerosa, commonly known as the hardstem diosma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by dark blue to black berries. Diosma acerosa is adapted to arid and rocky environments, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. It has no significant commercial use but is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in its native range."
