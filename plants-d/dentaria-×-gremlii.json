    "intro": "Dentaria \u00d7 gremlii, commonly known as the hybrid toothworts, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, tooth-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Dentaria \u00d7 gremlii is considered an endangered species in many regions."
