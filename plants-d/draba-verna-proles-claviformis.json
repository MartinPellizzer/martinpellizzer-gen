It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland edges and meadows. It is a winter annual, completing its life cycle within a single growing season. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
