    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. dactyloides, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, sod-forming habit and is well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is widely used for erosion control and as a low-maintenance lawn grass. Its botanical features make it a valuable species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
