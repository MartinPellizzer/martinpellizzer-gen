It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 5\u201315 cm. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This variety is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Draba verna."
