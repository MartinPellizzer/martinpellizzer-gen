    "intro": "Dryopteris alfredii, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive golden-brown margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
