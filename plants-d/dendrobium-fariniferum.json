    "intro": "Dendrobium fariniferum, commonly known as the floury dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often blooming during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which gives it its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
