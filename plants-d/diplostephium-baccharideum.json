    "intro": "Diplostephium baccharideum, commonly known as the green cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny clusters of stems that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid environments. The plant is well adapted to desert conditions and plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
