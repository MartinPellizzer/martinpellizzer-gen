It features showy, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces capsule fruits that release seeds in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
