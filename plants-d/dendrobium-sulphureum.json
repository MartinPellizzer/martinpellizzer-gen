It features a sympodial growth habit with numerous cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium sulphureum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
