    "intro": "Dalbergia variabilis var. tomentosa, commonly known as the white sand rosewood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, elongated seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry to semi-arid habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
