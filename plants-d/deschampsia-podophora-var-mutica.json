    "intro": "Deschampsia podophora var. mutica, commonly known as the silky hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silky, silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands or grassy areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. The variety *mutica* is distinguished by its soft, hairy texture, which is more pronounced than in the typical form of *Deschampsia podophora*."
