    "intro": "Dictyostega, commonly known as the \"leafy sponge\" or \"tree of life,\" is a unique plant with a complex structure that combines features of both fungi and plants. It is characterized by its branching, leaf-like structures that resemble the leaves of a tree, though it lacks true roots and stems. The plant is composed of a central axis with lateral branches that bear small, leaf-like appendages called phylloids. These phylloids are capable of photosynthesis, allowing the plant to produce its own food. Dictyostega thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
