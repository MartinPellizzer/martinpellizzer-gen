    "intro": "Dryopteris vidyae, commonly known as the Vidyasagar water fern, is a species of fern native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help in anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
