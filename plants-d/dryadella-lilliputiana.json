    "intro": "Dryadella lilliputiana, commonly known as the fairy's whisper, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features delicate, translucent leaves that shimmer with a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a unique adaptation to its shaded habitat. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pale blue and violet, which bloom only during the early morning hours. Its roots are highly specialized, forming symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
