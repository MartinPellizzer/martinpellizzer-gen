It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by pods containing flat, bean-like seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
