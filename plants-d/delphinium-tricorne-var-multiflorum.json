    "intro": "Delphinium tricorne var. multiflorum, commonly known as the clustered delphinium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear dense clusters of blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens. Its striking floral display and moderate growth habit make it a valuable addition to both cultivated and natural landscapes."
