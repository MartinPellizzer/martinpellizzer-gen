    "intro": "Dioscorea cordata var. cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf yam, is a perennial vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. The tubers are often used in traditional cuisine and have been studied for their potential medicinal properties."
