    "intro": "Diglossus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of roots and its ability to absorb nutrients through its leaves. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in shaded, humid environments. Its flowers are pale green or white, with a unique structure that resembles a ghostly apparition. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Diglossus is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
