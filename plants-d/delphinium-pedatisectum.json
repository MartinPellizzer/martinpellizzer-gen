    "intro": "Delphinium pedatisectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are finely divided, giving the plant a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
