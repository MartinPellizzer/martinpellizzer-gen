    "intro": "Drosera rotundifolia var. gracilis, commonly known as slender sundew, is a variant of the common sundew, characterized by its slender, upright stems and smaller, more densely clustered leaves. It is a carnivorous plant native to northern regions, including parts of North America, Europe, and Asia, where it thrives in moist, acidic bogs and heathlands. The plant's leaves are covered in sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested by the plant's enzymes. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in late summer and contributing to its ecological role in nutrient-poor environments. This variant is often considered a rare and specialized species within the Drosera genus."
