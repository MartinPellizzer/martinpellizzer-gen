It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant is notable for its ability to produce a potent neurotoxic alkaloid called curare, which has historically been used by indigenous peoples for hunting. Its flowers are small and white, clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans. Due to its medicinal and toxic properties, it has attracted significant scientific interest."
