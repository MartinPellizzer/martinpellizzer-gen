    "intro": "Diplacus glutinosus var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the sticky monkeyflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that exude a sticky substance when disturbed. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of orange to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. The sticky secretions on its stems and leaves are a defense mechanism against herbivores and help in seed dispersal."
