    "intro": "Diplazium fuenzalidae, commonly known as the Fuenzalida's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous stolons, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds."
