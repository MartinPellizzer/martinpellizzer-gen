    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 neoinconspicua, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled margin. The plant produces fertile spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its lush, evergreen foliage."
