It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by tuberous roots that are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are covered in fine, stiff hairs. Dioscorea fastigiata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
