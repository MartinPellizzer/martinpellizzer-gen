    "intro": "Drypetes crocea, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-bark and elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in many regions."
