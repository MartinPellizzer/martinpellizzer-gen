    "intro": "Dacryodes leonardiana, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to West Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark and dark, glossy leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing aromatic seeds. It is often found in moist lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
