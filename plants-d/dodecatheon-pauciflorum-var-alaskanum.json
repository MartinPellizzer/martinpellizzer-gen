    "intro": "Dodecatheon pauciflorum var. alaskanum, commonly known as the Alaskan glory-of-the-snow, is a flowering plant native to Alaska and western Canada. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. It produces small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, making it a notable early-season wildflower."
