It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its hairy, reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by tuberous roots, which are its edible parts. These tubers are often used in traditional cuisines and have a starchy, slightly sweet flavor. Dioscorea rubiginosa is also valued for its medicinal properties in some cultures."
