    "intro": "Dryopteris goeldii, commonly known as the Goeld's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into a complex arrangement of pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients effectively. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens."
