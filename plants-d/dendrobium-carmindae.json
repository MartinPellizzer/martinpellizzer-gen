    "intro": "Dendrobium carmindae, commonly known as the Mindanao orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically blooms during the dry season, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
