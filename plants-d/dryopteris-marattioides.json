    "intro": "Dryopteris marattioides, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators. The fronds are composed of multiple pinnae, which are arranged in a distinctive, overlapping pattern."
