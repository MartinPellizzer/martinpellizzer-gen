    "intro": "Dichanthium polyptychum var. deccanense, commonly known as the Deccan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
