    "intro": "Diplazium retusum, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are covered with small, backward-pointing teeth, giving it a distinctive appearance. Diplazium retusum is often found in tropical and subtropical forests, where it thrives in the understory with high humidity and indirect light."
