    "intro": "Delphinium delavayi var. acuminatum, commonly known as the Tibetan larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with sparsely arranged, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are basal and lanceolate, with a rough texture and a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat in alpine regions, it is adapted to cold climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
