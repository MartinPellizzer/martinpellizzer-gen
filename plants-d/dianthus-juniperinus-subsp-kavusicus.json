    "intro": "Dianthus juniperinus subsp. kavusicus, commonly known as the Kavusi thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and has a distinctive, thimble-shaped flower head. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
