    "intro": "Diplopappus macrocephalus, commonly known as the large-headed dandelion, is a herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a tall, unbranched stem that bears a single, large, yellow flower head. The flower head consists of numerous small, yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. After flowering, it produces a distinctive, two-parted seed dispersal structure called a pappus, which aids in wind pollination and seed distribution. This plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
