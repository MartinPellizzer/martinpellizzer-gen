    "intro": "Daphne fasciculiflora, commonly known as the clustered daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dense, compact growth with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and lilac, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its flowers are followed by small, woody fruits that contain seeds. Daphne fasciculiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its winter interest and delicate fragrance."
