    "intro": "Deyeuxia lagurus, commonly known as the slender false rice, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and floodplains, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. Deyeuxia lagurus plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
