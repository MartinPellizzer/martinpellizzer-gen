    "intro": "Duguetia sooretamae, commonly known as the Amazonian star apple, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The tree produces edible, yellow-orange fruits that are similar in appearance to star fruit, though less commonly consumed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
