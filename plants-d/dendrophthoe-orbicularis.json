    "intro": "Dendrophthoe orbicularis, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its life cycle involves bird-dispersed seeds, which germinate on the bark of suitable host trees. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host but also plays a role in forest ecosystem dynamics."
