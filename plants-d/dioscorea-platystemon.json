It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and tuberous roots. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its tubers are sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a food source. The leaves are heart-shaped and can grow quite large, contributing to its ornamental value in some regions."
