    "intro": "Dalea nutans, commonly known as the nodding milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and are often tinged with red. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Dalea nutans plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
