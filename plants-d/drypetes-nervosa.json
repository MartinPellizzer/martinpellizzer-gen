It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with prominent venation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a typical feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. The plant is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its wood and medicinal properties."
