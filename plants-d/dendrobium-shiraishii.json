    "intro": "Dendrobium shiraishii, commonly known as the Shiraishi dendrobium, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a yellow throat, during the spring and early summer. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
