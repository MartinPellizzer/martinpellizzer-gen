It is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs and long, narrow leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a prominent lip that is often marked with purple or brown speckles. This epiphytic plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
