    "intro": "Draba norvegica, commonly known as the Norwegian rockcress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia, including parts of Norway, Scandinavia, and the Alps. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. It produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments."
