    "intro": "Dacryodes rostrata f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy beach almond, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elongated, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, almond-like fruits that are yellow when mature. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in mangrove and coastal forest ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
