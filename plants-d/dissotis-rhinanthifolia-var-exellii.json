It is characterized by its striking, pinkish-white flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rainforests or under dense canopies. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in fine hairs, which help in retaining moisture. This variant is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
