    "intro": "Dryopteris nemoralis, commonly known as the woodland shield fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices, where it forms dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Dryopteris nemoralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
