    "intro": "Dactylis hispanica var. sibthorpii, commonly known as the Spanish brome, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brownish spikelets. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in disturbed or semi-natural habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
