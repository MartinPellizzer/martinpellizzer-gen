It is characterized by its large, showy bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its foliage is thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Denscantia macrobracteata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique appearance."
