    "intro": "Deyeuxia ciliata var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth fringed sedge, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with fine, ciliate hairs. The inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is distinguished by its reduced hairy structures, giving it a smoother appearance compared to the typical form. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
