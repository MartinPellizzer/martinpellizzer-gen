It is a climbing vine that produces edible tubers, which are rich in starch and have been traditionally used in local cuisines. The plant has a complex root system and thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and can grow quite large, while its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures. The tubers of Dioscorea goyazensis are often cultivated for their nutritional value and are an important food source in some regions."
