    "intro": "Dianthus glaucus, commonly known as the blue dianthus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, grayish-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Dianthus glaucus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
