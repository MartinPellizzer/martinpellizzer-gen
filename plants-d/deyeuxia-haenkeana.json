It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a tendency to curl at the edges. Deyeuxia haenkeana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
