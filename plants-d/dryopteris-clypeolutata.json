    "intro": "Dryopteris clypeolutata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that form a rounded, shield-like shape, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, glossy dark green coloration. The shield fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shady garden settings."
