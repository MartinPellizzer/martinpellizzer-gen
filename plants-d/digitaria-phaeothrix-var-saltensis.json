    "intro": "Digitaria phaeothrix var. saltensis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, blue-green blades that are adapted to saline soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains, typical of the grass family. It is drought-tolerant and often found in coastal or saline environments. Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of stabilizing soils in degraded areas."
