    "intro": "Duosperma fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. The plant features a tall, branching stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy yellow flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are clustered in racemes and are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
