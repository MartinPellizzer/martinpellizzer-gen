    "intro": "Dischidia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy dischidia, is a climbing or trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its unique growth habit and ability to thrive in shaded environments make it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Dischidia hirsuta is also noted for its ability to form aerial roots, which help it attach to surfaces as it climbs."
