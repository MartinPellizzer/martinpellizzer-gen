    "intro": "Dendrobium faulhaberianum, commonly known as the Faulhaber's orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, fragrant scent. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
