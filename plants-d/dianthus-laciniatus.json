    "intro": "Dianthus laciniatus, commonly known as the cut-leaved campion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has finely dissected leaves that give it a feathery appearance, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. Dianthus laciniatus is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other well-known species like carnations and poppies. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
