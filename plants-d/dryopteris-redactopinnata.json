    "intro": "Dryopteris redactopinnata, commonly known as the red wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a reddish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in spherical clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
