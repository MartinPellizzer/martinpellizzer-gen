    "intro": "Dendrophthora bermejae, commonly known as the Mexican ghost fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with high levels of atmospheric moisture. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns, and it relies on spores for propagation. Due to habitat destruction, Dendrophthora bermejae is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique botanical species."
