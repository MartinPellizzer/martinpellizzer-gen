    "intro": "Dendrobium dolichocaulon, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive elongated stem. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Dendrobium dolichocaulon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
