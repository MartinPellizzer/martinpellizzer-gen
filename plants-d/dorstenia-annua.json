    "intro": "Dorstenia annua, commonly known as the annual milkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate and often have a velvety texture, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Dorstenia annua plays a role in supporting local insect populations, particularly as a host plant for certain Lepidoptera species."
