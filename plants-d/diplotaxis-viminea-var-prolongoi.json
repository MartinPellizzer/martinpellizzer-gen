    "intro": "Diplotaxis viminea var. prolongoi, commonly known as the slender sandbur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spiny, three-lobed bracts that enclose the seeds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in sandy soils and its role in stabilizing dunes in its native habitat."
