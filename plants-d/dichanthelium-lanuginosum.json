    "intro": "Dichanthelium lanuginosum, commonly known as the silky grass or silky bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant typically grows in wet to mesic habitats such as marshes, swales, and roadside ditches. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelets that are often tinged with purple. Dichanthelium lanuginosum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
