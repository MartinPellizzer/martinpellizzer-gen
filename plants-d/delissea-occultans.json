    "intro": "Delissea occultans, commonly known as the hidden delissea, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the dense, humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom during the late spring and early summer. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or along the roots of larger trees. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to low-light conditions and its role in supporting local biodiversity. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Delissea occultans is considered a conservation concern."
