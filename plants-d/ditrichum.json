    "intro": "Ditrichum, commonly known as the moss, is a genus of small, non-vascular plants belonging to the family Dicranaceae. These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments and are characterized by their delicate, low-growing structure. They form dense carpets on soil, rocks, or tree trunks, contributing to soil stabilization and moisture retention. The leaves of Ditrichum species are usually narrow and arranged in two rows, with a distinctive costa that extends the length of the leaf. They play an important role in ecological systems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
