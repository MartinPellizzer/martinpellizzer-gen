    "intro": "Draba nivalis f. leiocarpa, commonly known as the white-flowered rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact rosette of basal leaves and produces numerous slender stems that bear white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in mountainous areas with harsh climatic conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to cold environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude regions."
