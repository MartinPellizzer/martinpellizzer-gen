    "intro": "Dryopteris polypodioides, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. The fronds are bi-lobed and often have a distinctive, elegant appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant."
