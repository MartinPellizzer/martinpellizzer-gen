    "intro": "Discophytum, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. The plants typically have opposite leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Discophytum species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. They play a role in local ecosystems, though some species are considered invasive in certain areas."
