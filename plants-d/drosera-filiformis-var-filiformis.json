    "intro": "Drosera filiformis var. filiformis, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, hair-like leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments and thrives in areas with high humidity. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or reddish in color, adding to its ornamental appeal. Despite its appearance, it is a hardy plant that can be cultivated in suitable conditions with proper care."
