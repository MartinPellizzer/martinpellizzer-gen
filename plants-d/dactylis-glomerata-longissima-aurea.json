    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata longissima-aurea, commonly known as the golden sweet veldtgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize soil. The plant produces clusters of spikelets that are often tinged with a golden hue, giving it its cultivar name. It thrives in temperate climates and is often used in pasture and erosion control due to its hardiness. Its foliage is typically narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive yellowish-green coloration."
