    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis var. jessenii, commonly known as the Jessen's wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its lanceolate, serrated fronds that emerge in a compact, upright cluster. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in partially shaded garden settings."
