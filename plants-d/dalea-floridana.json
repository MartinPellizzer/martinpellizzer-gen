    "intro": "Dalea floridana, commonly known as the Florida milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple blossoms. The plant typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and scrub habitats. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Dalea floridana is considered a rare and endangered species."
