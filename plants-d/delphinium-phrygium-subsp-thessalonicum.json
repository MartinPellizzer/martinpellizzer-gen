    "intro": "Delphinium phrygium subsp. thessalonicum, commonly known as the Greek larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of blue to violet flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, doubly serrated leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires specific growing conditions to flourish."
