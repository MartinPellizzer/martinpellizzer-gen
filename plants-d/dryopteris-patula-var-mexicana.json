    "intro": "Dryopteris patula var. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a shade-loving fern native to Mexico. It features broad, leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its lush foliage and ability to thrive in humid, cool environments."
