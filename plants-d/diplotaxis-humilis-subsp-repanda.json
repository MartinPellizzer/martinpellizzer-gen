    "intro": "Diplotaxis humilis subsp. repanda, commonly known as the slender wallflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features delicate, branched stems covered in fine hairs and produces small, yellowish-orange flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its compact growth and attractive flowers, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
