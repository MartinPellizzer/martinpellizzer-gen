    "intro": "Desmodium pachyrhizum f. intermedium, commonly known as the creeping desmodium, is a perennial leguminous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and dense, low-growing habit. It produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaflets contribute to its distinctive appearance. This species is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
