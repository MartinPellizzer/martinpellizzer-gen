    "intro": "Dasystephana latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved dasystephana, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
