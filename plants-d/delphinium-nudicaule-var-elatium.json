    "intro": "Delphinium nudicaule var. elatium, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting clusters of sky-blue to violet flowers. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its striking appearance and hardiness, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens and rockeries."
