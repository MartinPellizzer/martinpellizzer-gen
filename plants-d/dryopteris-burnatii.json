    "intro": "Dryopteris burnatii, commonly known as the Burnat's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it forms dense colonies on rocky or soil substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
