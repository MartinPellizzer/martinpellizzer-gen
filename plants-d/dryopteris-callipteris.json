    "intro": "Dryopteris callipteris, commonly known as the rock fern or cliff brake, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as cliffs and woodland areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
