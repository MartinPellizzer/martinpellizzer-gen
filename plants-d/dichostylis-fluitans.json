    "intro": "Dichostylis fluitans, commonly known as the floating dichostylis, is a unique aquatic plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help in water retention. The plant produces two types of flowers\u2014sterile and fertile\u2014on separate stems, a feature known as dichogamy. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, allowing it to thrive in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats. This species plays a role in providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and stabilizing water surfaces."
