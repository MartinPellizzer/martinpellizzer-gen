    "intro": "Dischidia aberrans, commonly known as the hanging basket vine, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its unique ability to grow on trees and form aerial roots makes it well adapted to its natural habitat. Dischidia aberrans is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care and attractive foliage."
