    "intro": "Dendrobium aurantiacum, commonly known as the orange-lipped dendrobium, is a flowering orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. It is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
