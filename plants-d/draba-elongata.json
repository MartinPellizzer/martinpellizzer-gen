It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in alpine and arctic regions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, and the plant is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments. Draba elongata is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is considered an indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems."
