    "intro": "Ditrysinia sylvatica, commonly known as the European white heath, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils, often found in heathlands and moorlands. The plant is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold climates and poor soil nutrients. Its floral structure supports pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitats."
