    "intro": "Draba hoppei, commonly known as the Tibetan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of Asia, particularly in Tibet and Nepal. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and low-growing habit. The plant typically thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Draba hoppei has small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is often found in alpine meadows and is an important species in the study of plant adaptation to extreme environments."
