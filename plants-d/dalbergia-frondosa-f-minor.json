It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant is notable for its hard, dark wood, which is highly valued in traditional woodworking. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed or secondary forests.
