    "intro": "Dryopteris speluncae, commonly known as the cave fern, is a rare and specialized fern species adapted to grow in dark, humid cave environments. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky substrates and relies on spore dispersal for propagation. The plant has reduced leaves compared to its more common relatives, with a dense, compact growth form that helps it survive in low-light conditions. Its fronds are typically small and leathery, with a unique morphology suited to its subterranean habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
