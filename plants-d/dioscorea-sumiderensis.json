    "intro": "Dioscorea sumiderensis, commonly known as the Sumidera yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary storage organs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a rough texture, while the stems are hairy and twining. The tubers of D. sumiderensis are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some local communities."
