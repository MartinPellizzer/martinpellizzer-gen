    "intro": "Diospyros hermaphroditica var. olivacea, commonly known as the olive persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are both male and female, making it a perfect flower species. Its fruit is a small, orange-red berry that ripens in the fall and is edible when fully mature. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its fruit, which has a sweet, nutty flavor."
