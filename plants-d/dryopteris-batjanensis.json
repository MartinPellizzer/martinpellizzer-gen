    "intro": "Dryopteris batjanensis, commonly known as the Batjan's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
