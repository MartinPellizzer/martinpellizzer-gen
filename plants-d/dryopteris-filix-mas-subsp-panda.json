    "intro": "Dryopteris filix-mas subsp. panda, commonly known as the panda fern, is a variant of the male fern characterized by its unique frond morphology. It features large, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive black and green coloration, resembling the black-and-white pattern of a panda. The plant is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
