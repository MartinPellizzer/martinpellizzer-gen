    "intro": "Disa barellii, commonly known as the naked lady, is a striking member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) native to southern Africa. This plant is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The flowers are typically pink or purple with a distinctive yellow throat, and they emit a subtle fragrance. Disa barellii is a bulbous plant that relies on its underground corm for storage of nutrients and water. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
