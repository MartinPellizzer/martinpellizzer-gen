    "intro": "Dendrobium \u00d7 aurantiivinosum, commonly known as the orange-flowered dendrobium, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of orange and yellow, often in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in two rows, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
