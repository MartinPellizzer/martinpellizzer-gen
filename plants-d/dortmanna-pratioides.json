    "intro": "Dortmanna pratioides, commonly known as the common dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces rosettes of lanceolate, dark green leaves with a waxy coating. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
