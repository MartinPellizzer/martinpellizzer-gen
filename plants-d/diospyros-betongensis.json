    "intro": "Diospyros betongensis, commonly known as the Betong ebony, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is known for its elliptical leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, attracting various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
