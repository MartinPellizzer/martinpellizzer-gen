    "intro": "Danthonia maxima, commonly known as the giant muirgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant produces inflorescences of spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color, which appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Danthonia maxima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
