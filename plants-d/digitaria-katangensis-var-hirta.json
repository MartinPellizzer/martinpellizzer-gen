    "intro": "Digitaria katangensis var. hirta, commonly known as the Katanga hairy digitaria, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its erect, slender culms and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
