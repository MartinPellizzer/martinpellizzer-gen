    "intro": "Dyschoriste schiedeana var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate dyschoriste, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are often borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
