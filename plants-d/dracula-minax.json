    "intro": "Dracula minax, commonly known as the vampire orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, dark red petals that resemble blood, hence its ominous common name. The plant produces intricate, hood-like flowers that are often adorned with dark markings, resembling a vampire's face. Dracula minax thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its botanical rarity and dramatic appearance make it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts."
