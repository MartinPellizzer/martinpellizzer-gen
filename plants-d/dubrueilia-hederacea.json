    "intro": "Dubrueilia hederacea, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive yellowish-green color and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pale yellow. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its foliage is edible, though it contains oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities. Dubrueilia hederacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
