    "intro": "Digitaria sanguinolenta, commonly known as bloodset, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its reddish stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along waterways, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Digitaria sanguinolenta is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
