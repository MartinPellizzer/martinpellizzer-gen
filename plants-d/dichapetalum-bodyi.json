    "intro": "Dichapetalum bodyi, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a striking plant native to the savannas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. Its flowers are typically borne on long, slender stalks, and the plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. Dichapetalum bodyi is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit."
