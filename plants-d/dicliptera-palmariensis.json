It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Dicliptera palmariensis is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
