    "intro": "Diosma muraltioides, commonly known as the muraltioides diosma, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its tubular flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a rough texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
