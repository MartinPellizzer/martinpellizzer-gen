    "intro": "Dicranolepis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered marsh fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to wetland habitats in South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for reproduction. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
