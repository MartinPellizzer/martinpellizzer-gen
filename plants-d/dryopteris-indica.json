    "intro": "Dryopteris indica, commonly known as the Indian shield fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are composed of a central stalk with multiple fiddlehead-like young shoots that unfurl into mature leaves."
