    "intro": "Dendrobium denigratum, commonly known as the dark-stemmed orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, often hairy stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Dendrobium denigratum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
