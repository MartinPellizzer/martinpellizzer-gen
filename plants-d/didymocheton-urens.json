    "intro": "Didymocheton urens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sago palm, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves that are narrow and feather-like. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is a popular choice for gardens and conservation efforts."
