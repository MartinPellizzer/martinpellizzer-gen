    "intro": "Dorycnium villosum, commonly known as the hairy goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, feathery leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its seeds are enclosed in a hairy, pod-like structure that aids in dispersal. Dorycnium villosum is often found in disturbed areas and can thrive in poor soil conditions."
