    "intro": "Deverra juncea, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which are adaptations to its coastal habitat. The plant has a robust, upright growth habit with spiny stems and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Deverra juncea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in coastal environments."
