    "intro": "Draco bicolor, commonly known as the dragon's blood tree, is a unique succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its most notable feature is the dark red sap, which has been historically used for medicinal and artistic purposes. The species is also notable for its ability to regenerate from its base after being damaged or burned."
