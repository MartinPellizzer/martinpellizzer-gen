    "intro": "Dicranopteris cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are finely divided and help anchor it to submerged surfaces. The fronds are usually bi-lobed and have a distinctive, feathery appearance."
