    "intro": "Dendrobium praecinctum, commonly known as the Orchid of the East, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, and it prefers warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Dendrobium praecinctum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
