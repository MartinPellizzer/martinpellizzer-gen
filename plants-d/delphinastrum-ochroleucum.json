    "intro": "Delphinastrum ochroleucum, commonly known as the white-flowered milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in the summer months. Its milky sap is a characteristic feature, often used by certain insects for defense. Delphinastrum ochroleucum thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is an important plant for pollinators."
