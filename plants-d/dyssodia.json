    "intro": "Dyssodia, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble dandelions. Dyssodia species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Due to its hardy nature, Dyssodia is often used in xeriscaping and as a pioneer species in disturbed environments."
