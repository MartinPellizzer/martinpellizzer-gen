    "intro": "Dendrobium ostrinum var. ochroleucum, commonly known as the White Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, cane-like stems that bear clusters of small, white flowers with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. This variety is prized for its elegant appearance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
