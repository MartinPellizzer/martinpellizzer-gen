    "intro": "Delissea stictophylla var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth-leaved delissea, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green with a soft texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but challenging plant for cultivation."
