    "intro": "Draba luteola var. minganensis, commonly known as the Mingan yellow rocket, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the rocky habitats of the Mingan Archipelago in Quebec, Canada. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and specialized adaptations for nutrient-poor environments. The plant typically grows in open, sun-exposed areas, often on limestone or granitic substrates. Its yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, elongated pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
