    "intro": "Dendrobium superbum var. dearei, commonly known as the Deare's orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the alpine regions of Tasmania. It is an epiphytic orchid that thrives in cool, humid environments, often growing on rock faces or tree trunks. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are leathery and strap-shaped, adapted to conserve moisture in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
