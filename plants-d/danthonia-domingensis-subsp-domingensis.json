    "intro": "Danthonia domingensis subsp. domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as dry forests and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
