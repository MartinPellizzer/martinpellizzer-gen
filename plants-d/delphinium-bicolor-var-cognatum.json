    "intro": "Delphinium bicolor var. cognatum, commonly known as the Colorado larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers with a distinctive spurred petal. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are alternate and often tinged with silver. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and children."
