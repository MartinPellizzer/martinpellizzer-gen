    "intro": "Dryopteris glaucescens, commonly known as the blue wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It features a tall, upright rhizome with dark, leathery fronds that are typically bluish-green in color. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often slightly curled at the tips. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture for its distinctive foliage."
