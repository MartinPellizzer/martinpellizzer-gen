    "intro": "Dilodendron costaricense, commonly known as the Costa Rican lily, is a striking plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pale pink flowers that resemble lilies, hence its common name. The plant has long, slender leaves and produces a distinctive, fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. It thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, often growing along stream banks or in shaded understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
