    "intro": "Delphinium armeniacum, commonly known as Armenian larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, adorned with whorled, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense spikes at the top of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate, spurred petals and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
