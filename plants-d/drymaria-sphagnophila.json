    "intro": "Drymaria sphagnophila, commonly known as the bog myrtle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in moist, acidic soils. Drymaria sphagnophila is often found in peat bogs and is valued for its aromatic properties and historical use in traditional medicine."
