    "intro": "Dalbergia matthewii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its dense, dark color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and musical instrument industries. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List."
