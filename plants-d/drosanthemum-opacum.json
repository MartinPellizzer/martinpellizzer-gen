It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, composite flower heads. The plant features fuzzy, silver-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in its arid native habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, with a central disc surrounded by ray florets. Drosanthemum opacum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
