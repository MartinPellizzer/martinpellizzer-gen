    "intro": "Dischidia parasita, commonly known as the parasitic fig vine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from its host plant while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers. It typically grows on trees or shrubs in tropical and subtropical regions. Dischidia parasita is often found in humid environments and can be a common epiphyte in rainforests."
