It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
