    "intro": "Dendrobium polyrhopalon, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or golden in color, with a distinctive spike-like structure that gives it its common name. Dendrobium polyrhopalon is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
