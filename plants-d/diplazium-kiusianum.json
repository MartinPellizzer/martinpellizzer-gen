    "intro": "Diplazium kiusianum, commonly known as the Kiusianum water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help in stabilizing the substrate while also absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded lobes that contribute to its ornamental appearance."
