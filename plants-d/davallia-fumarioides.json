    "intro": "Davallia fumarioides, commonly known as the walking fern, is a species of polypody fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that produce upright, arching fronds with a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant's fronds are typically light green with a leathery texture and are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its unique growth habit, where new fronds appear at the base and older ones trail downward, gives it its common name."
