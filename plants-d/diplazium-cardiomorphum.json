    "intro": "Diplazium cardiomorphum, commonly known as the heart-shaped water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are heart-shaped and often tinged with red or purple. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and rice fields. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic life. Diplazium cardiomorphum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland ecosystems."
