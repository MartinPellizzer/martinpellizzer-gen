    "intro": "Diplazium longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically long and slender, with a distinctive, creeping growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize areas efficiently. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
