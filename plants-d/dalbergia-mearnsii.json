    "intro": "Dalbergia mearnsii, commonly known as ironwood or blackwood, is a leguminous tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and is often used in furniture and musical instruments due to its durability. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, posing a threat to native ecosystems."
