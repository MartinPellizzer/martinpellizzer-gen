    "intro": "Darea prolifera, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive seed heads that resemble dandelion fluff. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy plains. Darea prolifera is adapted to full sun and is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
