    "intro": "Dorycnium, commonly known as goat's beard, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs native to Europe and western Asia. The plants are characterized by their fern-like, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in racemes. Dorycnium species are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
