    "intro": "Dryopteris recumbens, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and fronds that are typically dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fertile fronds, which are usually smaller and more compact than the sterile ones. The plant's ability to spread via rhizomes makes it a persistent and resilient ground cover in its habitat."
