    "intro": "Daphne \u00d7 hendersonii, commonly known as the Henderson daphne, is a hybrid shrub native to the United Kingdom. It features dense, compact growth with dark green, glossy leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy flowers. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, waxy flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in temperate climates."
