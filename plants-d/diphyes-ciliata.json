It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forests or along riverbanks. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects."
