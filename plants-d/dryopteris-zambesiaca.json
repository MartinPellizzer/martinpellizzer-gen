    "intro": "Dryopteris zambesiaca, commonly known as the Zambesi water fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
