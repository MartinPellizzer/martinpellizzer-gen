    "intro": "Dendrobium latelabellatum, commonly known as the late-labellum dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with intricate patterns on the petals and lip. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette and are thick and leathery to reduce water loss. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
