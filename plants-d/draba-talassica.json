    "intro": "Draba talassica, commonly known as the coastal rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, compact inflorescences. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss. Draba talassica is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops and weeds."
