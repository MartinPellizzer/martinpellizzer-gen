    "intro": "Diogenesia amplectens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or colonies. The plant produces showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Diogenesia amplectens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
