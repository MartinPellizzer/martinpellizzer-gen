    "intro": "Diplaria, commonly known as the marsh hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Diplaria species are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including pink, red, and white. The leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. They play an important role in their ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
