    "intro": "Drosera pallida, commonly known as the pale sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are usually small and rosette-shaped, with the dew-like droplets giving it its common name. Drosera pallida is a perennial herb that produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months."
