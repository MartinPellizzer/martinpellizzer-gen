    "intro": "Disa nyikensis, commonly known as the Nyika orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Nyika Plateau of Malawi. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with yellow lips. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in open grassland areas. It has slender, erect stems with few leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
