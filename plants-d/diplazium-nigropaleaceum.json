    "intro": "Diplazium nigropaleaceum, commonly known as the black-pale leaf fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often tinged with a reddish hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium nigropaleaceum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions."
