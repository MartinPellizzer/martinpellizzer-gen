It belongs to the family Corallidae and is characterized by its branching, antler-like appearance. The plant thrives in shallow, warm waters of the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific oceans. Its skeletal structure provides habitat for various marine organisms. Desmophyllum plays a crucial role in coral reef ecosystems by contributing to reef framework and biodiversity."
