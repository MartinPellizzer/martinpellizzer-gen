    "intro": "Dryopteris septemjuga, commonly known as the seven-lobed wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among many fern species. The plant's rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
