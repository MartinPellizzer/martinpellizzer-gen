    "intro": "Dentaria pinnata, commonly known as the toothleaf violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, toothed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early spring. Its root system consists of a thick, fleshy taproot that stores nutrients and aids in survival during dry periods. Dentaria pinnata is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits."
