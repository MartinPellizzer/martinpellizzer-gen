    "intro": "Dendrobium parcum, commonly known as the slender dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without being parasitic. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Dendrobium parcum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
