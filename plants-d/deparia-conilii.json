    "intro": "Deparia conilii, commonly known as the coastal wood fern, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near the coast where salt spray is common. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in sandy or rocky soils. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
