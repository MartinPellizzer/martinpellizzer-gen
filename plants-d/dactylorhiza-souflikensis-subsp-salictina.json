    "intro": "Dactylorhiza souflikensis subsp. salictina, commonly known as the Salicina Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces striking, pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinct three-lobed lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in peat bogs or along the edges of forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring careful conservation efforts."
