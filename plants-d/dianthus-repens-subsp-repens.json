    "intro": "Dianthus repens subsp. repens, commonly known as the creeping pinks, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom throughout the summer. The plant has slender, branching stems that often lie flat on the ground, forming a mat-like growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
