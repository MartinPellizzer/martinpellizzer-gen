    "intro": "Diplazium centripetale, commonly known as the centripetal water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are pinnately compound, with pinnae arranged in a centripetal pattern, meaning they radiate inward toward the center of the frond. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Diplazium centripetale is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
