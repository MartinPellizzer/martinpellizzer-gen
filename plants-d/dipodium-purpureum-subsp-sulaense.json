    "intro": "Dipodium purpureum subsp. sulaense, commonly known as the Sula purple fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically tinged with a purplish hue, especially along the margins. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous or forested areas with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are arranged in distinctive patterns on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
