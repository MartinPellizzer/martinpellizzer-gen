    "intro": "Drosera dietrichiana, commonly known as the Dietrich's sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette shape. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn."
