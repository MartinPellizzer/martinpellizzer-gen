    "intro": "Dendrobium clarissimum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, often in clusters. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in environments with irregular rainfall. Dendrobium clarissimum is valued both for its ornamental beauty and for its cultural significance in traditional medicine."
