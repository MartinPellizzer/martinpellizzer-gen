    "intro": "Dendrobium lobbii, commonly known as the Lobb's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Dendrobium lobbii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for with proper conditions."
