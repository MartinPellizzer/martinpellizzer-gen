    "intro": "Dendrophthoe longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems and leaves, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a leathery texture, adapted to reduce water loss. Dendrophthoe longiflora plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain bird and insect species."
