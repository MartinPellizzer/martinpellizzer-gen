    "intro": "Dryopteris filix-mas var. parallelogramma, commonly known as the shield fern, is a variant of the common male fern. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
