It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to eastern Asia, particularly Japan. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with fertile fronds that are typically shorter and more compact than the sterile ones. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, feathery appearance and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
