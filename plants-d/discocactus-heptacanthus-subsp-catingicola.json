    "intro": "Discocactus heptacanthus subsp. catingicola, commonly known as the Catinga discocactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and minimal water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
