    "intro": "Deyeuxia junciformis, commonly known as the tufted sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-sided spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of its flowering stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas. Deyeuxia junciformis is valued for its ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity and its use in ornamental horticulture."
