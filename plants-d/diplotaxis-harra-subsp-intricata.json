    "intro": "Diplotaxis harra subsp. intricata, commonly known as the intricate burrweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its branched stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in poor soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
