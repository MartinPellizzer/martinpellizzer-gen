    "intro": "Dodonaea viscosa subsp. elaeagnoides, commonly known as silverleaf dodonaea, is a shrub native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, velvety foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry inland regions. Its adaptability makes it a common ornamental and sometimes invasive species in non-native environments."
