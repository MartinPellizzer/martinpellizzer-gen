    "intro": "Delphinium elatum lusus pallidum, commonly known as the pale larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The pale larkspur is valued in gardens for its striking flowers but is toxic to livestock and humans if ingested."
