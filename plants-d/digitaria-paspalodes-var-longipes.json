    "intro": "Digitaria paspalodes var. longipes, commonly known as the long-beaked panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
