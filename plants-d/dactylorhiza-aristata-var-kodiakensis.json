    "intro": "Dactylorhiza aristata var. kodiakensis, commonly known as the Kodiak orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Alaskan panhandle. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive red lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as bogs and swamps, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized mycorrhizal relationships that aid in nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
