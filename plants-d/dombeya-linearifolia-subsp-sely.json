    "intro": "Dombeya linearifolia subsp. sely, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dombeya, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are often pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich nature. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
