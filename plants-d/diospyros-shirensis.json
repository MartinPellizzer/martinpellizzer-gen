    "intro": "Diospyros shirensis, commonly known as the Shire date tree, is a species native to eastern Africa, particularly Tanzania and Kenya. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a smooth margin and a glossy green upper surface. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to yellow when mature, containing a single seed. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and its edible fruit, which is similar to a date in flavor and texture."
