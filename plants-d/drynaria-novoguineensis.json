It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive rhizome that grows underground, supporting the growth of the fronds above ground. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. The fronds are used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants in horticulture."
