    "intro": "Daucus carota subsp. majoricus, commonly known as the giant carrot, is a subspecies of the wild carrot that exhibits larger, more robust growth compared to the standard carrot. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, lobed leaves that can reach several feet in height. The flowers are typically white with a yellow center, forming umbels that bloom in the summer months. This plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its roots, while not as commonly cultivated as the common carrot, are edible and have a similar flavor profile."
