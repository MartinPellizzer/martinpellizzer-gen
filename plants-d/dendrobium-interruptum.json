    "intro": "Dendrobium interruptum, commonly known as the interrupted orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stem and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant typically blooms during the spring and summer months, producing long, narrow petals and a distinctive lip. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, allowing it to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Dendrobium interruptum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
