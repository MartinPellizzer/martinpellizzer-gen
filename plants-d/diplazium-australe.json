    "intro": "Diplazium australe, commonly known as the Australian water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi-pinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new growth along the soil surface. Diplazium australe plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
