    "intro": "Dicoelospermum, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed, resembling a four-leaf clover. These plants are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Dicoelospermum species are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and can form dense mats on the water surface. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
