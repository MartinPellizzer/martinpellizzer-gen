    "intro": "Dianthus setisquameus, commonly known as the sand dianthus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and coastal environments. Its flowers are typically surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves, and the plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Dianthus setisquameus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
