    "intro": "Dryopteris aoristisora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and shade gardens."
