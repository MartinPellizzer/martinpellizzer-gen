    "intro": "Dendrobium scoriarum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged along the stems, contributing to its overall aesthetic appeal. Dendrobium scoriarum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
