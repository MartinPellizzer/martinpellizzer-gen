It features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to harsh, dry climates."
