    "intro": "Dryopteris hayatae, commonly known as the Japanese wood fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris hayatae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
