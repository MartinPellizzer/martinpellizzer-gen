    "intro": "Dorstenia cayapia f. genuina, commonly known as the Cayap\u00e1 dwarf milkweed, is a unique plant species native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its peculiar, curling leaves that resemble the shape of a brain. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are often hidden among its dense foliage. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
