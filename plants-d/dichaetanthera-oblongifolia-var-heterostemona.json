    "intro": "Dichaetanthera oblongifolia var. heterostemona, commonly known as the variable-stemmed dichaetanthera, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The species is notable for its morphological variation, particularly in stem structure, which gives it its varietal name."
