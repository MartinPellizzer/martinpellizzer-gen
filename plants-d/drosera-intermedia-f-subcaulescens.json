    "intro": "Drosera intermedia f. subcaulescens, commonly known as the slender-stemmed sundew, is a variant of the common sundew, characterized by its elongated, slender stems. It is a carnivorous plant native to Australia, typically found in wetland and swampy environments. The plant features hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to moist, nutrient-poor soils and its unique method of nutrient acquisition through insect digestion."
