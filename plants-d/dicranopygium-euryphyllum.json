    "intro": "Dicranopygium euryphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds. Dicranopygium euryphyllum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
