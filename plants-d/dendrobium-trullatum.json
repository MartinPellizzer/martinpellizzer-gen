    "intro": "Dendrobium trullatum, commonly known as the orchid with the unusual flower shape, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are often described as resembling a bird's beak or a twisted ribbon. Its inflorescence typically consists of several flowers that bloom sequentially, adding to its ornamental value. Dendrobium trullatum is appreciated in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
