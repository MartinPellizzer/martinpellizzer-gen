    "intro": "Dendrobenthamia brevipedunculata, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
