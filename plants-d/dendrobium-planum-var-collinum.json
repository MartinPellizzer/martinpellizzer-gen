    "intro": "Dendrobium planum var. collinum, commonly known as the hill dendrobium, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizomatous stem that produces multiple pseudobulbs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a contrasting lip. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to humid, shaded environments."
