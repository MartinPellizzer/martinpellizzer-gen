    "intro": "Dalechampia humilis var. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping dalechampia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
