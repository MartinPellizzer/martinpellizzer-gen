    "intro": "Disphyma blackii, commonly known as the black mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in the spring and summer, producing yellow disc flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets."
