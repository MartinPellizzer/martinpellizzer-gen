    "intro": "Desmodium grahamii, commonly known as Graham's burr legume, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that are hairy and often curl into a spiral shape when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Desmodium grahamii is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility in ecological restoration projects."
