    "intro": "Durandoa clausonis, commonly known as the Clauson's durandoa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and thrives in tropical climates. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Durandoa clausonis is considered a species of conservation concern."
