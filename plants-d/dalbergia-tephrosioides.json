    "intro": "Dalbergia tephrosioides, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The tree produces small, elongated pods that contain flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts."
