    "intro": "Dianthera mucronata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. Dianthera mucronata is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
