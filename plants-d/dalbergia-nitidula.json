    "intro": "Dalbergia nitidula, commonly known as the white shea tree, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry savanna and woodland habitats. The tree is valued for its timber and seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil."
