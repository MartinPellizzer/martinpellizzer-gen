    "intro": "Digitaria parviflora, commonly known as littleflower buffalograss, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, pale green or brown flowers that are typically clustered in dense panicles. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for dryland restoration. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion and supports biodiversity in native grasslands."
