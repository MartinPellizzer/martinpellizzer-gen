    "intro": "Dryopteris inaequalis var. atropaleacea, commonly known as the dark-leaved wood fern, is a variant of the variable wood fern native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, irregular pattern of sori along the margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in rich, acidic soils. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often slightly curled at the tips. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are covered by a thin, membranous indusium, a feature common among ferns of the Dryopteris genus."
