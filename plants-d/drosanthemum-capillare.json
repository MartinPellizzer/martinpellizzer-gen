It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
