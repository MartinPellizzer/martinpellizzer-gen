    "intro": "Dendrophorbium missionum, commonly known as the Mission Desert cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of Baja California. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in sparse, pale green spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Due to its limited range and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
