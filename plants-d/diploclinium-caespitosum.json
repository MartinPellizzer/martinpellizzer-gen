    "intro": "Diploclinium caespitosum, commonly known as the creeping diploclinium, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form dense clusters. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, often with a yellow or greenish hue. The leaves are usually opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface."
