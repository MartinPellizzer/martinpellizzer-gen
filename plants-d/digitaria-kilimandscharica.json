    "intro": "Digitaria kilimandscharica, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of mountainous environments. Digitaria kilimandscharica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
