    "intro": "Dischidia chinensis, commonly known as the silver vine, is a climbing or trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Dischidia chinensis is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
