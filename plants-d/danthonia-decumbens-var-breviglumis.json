It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and is adapted to tolerate drought conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscaping."
