    "intro": "Desmodium dasylobum, commonly known as the hairy ticktrefoil, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy and have a distinctive lobed shape. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring or early summer. Its pods are slender and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Desmodium dasylobum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
