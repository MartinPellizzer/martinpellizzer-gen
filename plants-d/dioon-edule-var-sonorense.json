It is characterized by its stout, segmented trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species in desert ecosystems."
