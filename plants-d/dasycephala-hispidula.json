    "intro": "Dasycephala hispidula, commonly known as the roughhead wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes many legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has a rough, hairy texture on its stems and leaves, giving it its common name. Dasycephala hispidula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
