It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, supporting the growth of its compound leaves. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a unique arrangement of pinnae that distinguishes it from other fern species."
