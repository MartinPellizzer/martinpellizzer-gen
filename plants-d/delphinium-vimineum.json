    "intro": "Delphinium vimineum, commonly known as the creeping larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are finely toothed and arranged alternately along the stem. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, moist soils, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Delphinium vimineum is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and is also noted for its toxic alkaloids, which make it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
