    "intro": "Dalbergia lemurica, commonly known as the Madagascar rosewood, is a leguminous tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its rarity and high demand, Dalbergia lemurica is considered an endangered species."
