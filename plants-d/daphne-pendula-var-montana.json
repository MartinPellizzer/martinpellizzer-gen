    "intro": "Daphne pendula var. montana, commonly known as the mountain daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a velvety texture with a dark green upper surface. The plant produces orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
