    "intro": "Dendrosenecio elgonensis, commonly known as the Elgon giant dandelion, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Elgon in East Africa. It is characterized by its large, rosette-forming leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
