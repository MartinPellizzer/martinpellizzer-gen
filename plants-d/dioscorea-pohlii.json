    "intro": "Dioscorea pohlii, commonly known as the Pohli's yam, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for propagation and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and tend to climb by means of tendrils. The tubers of Dioscorea pohlii are often used in traditional medicine and are valued for their potential nutritional and pharmacological properties."
