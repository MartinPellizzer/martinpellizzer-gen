    "intro": "Dendrobium tetraedre, commonly known as the four-sided orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, four-sided pseudobulbs that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically during the dry season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to climbing and photosynthesis in its natural habitat. Dendrobium tetraedre is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
