    "intro": "Disticholiparis kerintjiensis, commonly known as the Kerintji endemic fern, is a rare plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique frond structure, featuring two distinct rows of pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
