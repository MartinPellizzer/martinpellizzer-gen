    "intro": "Dioscorea chiapasensis, commonly known as the Chiapas yam, is a climbing vine native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the genus Dioscorea, which includes various species of yams, and is characterized by its tuberous roots that are used in traditional medicine and as a food source. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers. Its tubers are typically swollen and have a starchy texture, though they are not widely cultivated commercially. The species is notable for its ecological importance in its native habitats and its role in indigenous agricultural practices."
