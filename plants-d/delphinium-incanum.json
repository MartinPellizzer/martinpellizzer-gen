    "intro": "Delphinium incanum, commonly known as the hoary larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost frosty appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion."
