It consists of several species, primarily found in southern Africa, where they thrive in rocky and arid environments. The plants are characterized by their small, often clustered leaves and edible fruits that are typically yellow or green when ripe. Deroemera species are shrubs or small trees, often growing on rocky outcrops and in coastal areas. They play an important ecological role in their native habitats, providing food for various wildlife species."
