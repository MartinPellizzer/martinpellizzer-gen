    "intro": "Dortmanna coronopifolia var. paucidentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved starwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in umbels.
