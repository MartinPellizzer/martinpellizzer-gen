    "intro": "Dryopteris fordii, commonly known as the Ford's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in soil while absorbing nutrients. Dryopteris fordii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
