    "intro": "Desmodium adscendens f. glabrescens, commonly known as the silky desmodium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with three oval to ovate leaflets, often covered in fine, silky hairs that give it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, which are typically borne in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and forage."
