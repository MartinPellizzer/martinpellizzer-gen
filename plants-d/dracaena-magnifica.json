    "intro": "Dracaena magnifica, commonly known as the Madagascar dragon tree, is a striking ornamental plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and its large, strap-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its native arid environment. Dracaena magnifica is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
