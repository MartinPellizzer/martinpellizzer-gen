    "intro": "Dryopteris remotissima, commonly known as the remote wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
