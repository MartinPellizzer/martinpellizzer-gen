    "intro": "Deyeuxia moupinensis, commonly known as the Moupin sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of China, particularly in Yunnan Province. This perennial herb typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its slender, grass-like leaves are usually arranged in a dense rosette, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. The plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
