    "intro": "Dolianthus trichanthus, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in hot, dry climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Dolianthus trichanthus is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
