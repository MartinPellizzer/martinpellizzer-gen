    "intro": "Dryopteris villarii subsp. balearica, commonly known as the Balearic wood fern, is a rare fern species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly the Balearic Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, with a pale green hue. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
