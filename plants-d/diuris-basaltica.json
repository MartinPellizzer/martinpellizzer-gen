    "intro": "Diuris basaltica, commonly known as the basalt orchid, is a striking plant native to the basaltic regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its vivid, often purple or pink, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its unique floral structure includes a long, narrow spur that houses the nectar, attracting specific pollinators like birds or insects. Diuris basaltica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
