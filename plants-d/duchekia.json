    "intro": "Duchekia, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer. They are native to regions of Europe, particularly the Mediterranean, and often thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Duchekia species are typically herbaceous perennials, though some may behave as annuals depending on the climate. The leaves are usually oval or lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and the plants produce small, berry-like fruits that contain the seeds."
