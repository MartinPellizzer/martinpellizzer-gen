    "intro": "Dolichos halei, commonly known as the African snail vine, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. Dolichos halei is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its potential as a food source in some cultures."
