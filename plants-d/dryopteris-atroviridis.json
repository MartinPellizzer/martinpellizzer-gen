    "intro": "Dryopteris atroviridis, commonly known as the black wire fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled and have a dense, wiry appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
