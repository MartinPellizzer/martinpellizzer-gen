    "intro": "Dryopteris sancta, commonly known as the sacred fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Dryopteris sancta is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples."
