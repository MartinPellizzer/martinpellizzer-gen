    "intro": "Drosera bulbosa, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in a spike, and it produces a single seed capsule that disperses its seeds. Drosera bulbosa is a hardy plant that can survive in poor soil conditions due to its specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition."
