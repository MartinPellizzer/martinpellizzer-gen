    "intro": "Dryopteris percivalii, commonly known as the Percival's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of the Dryopteris genus."
