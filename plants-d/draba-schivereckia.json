    "intro": "Draba schivereckia, commonly known as the Schivereck's whitlow, is a small flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically blooming before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
