    "intro": "Deyeuxia mutica, commonly known as the smooth sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often hairless or nearly so, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like in appearance. Deyeuxia mutica produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Cyperaceae family. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
