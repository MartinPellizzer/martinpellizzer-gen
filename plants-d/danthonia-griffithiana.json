It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
