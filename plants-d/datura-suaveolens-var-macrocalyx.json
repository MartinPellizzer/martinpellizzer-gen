    "intro": "Datura suaveolens var. macrocalyx, commonly known as the giant devil's trumpet, is a striking member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is characterized by its large, funnel-shaped flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length, typically blooming in shades of purple and white. The plant produces spiny, egg-shaped fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to South America, it thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it is toxic due to the presence of tropane alkaloids, making it a plant to handle with care."
