    "intro": "Drynaria torulosa, commonly known as the rock fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hardy, leathery fronds that can withstand dry conditions, making it well-suited for rocky or arid environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that can form dense mats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Drynaria torulosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging climates."
