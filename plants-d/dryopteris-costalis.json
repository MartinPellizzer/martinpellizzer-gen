    "intro": "Dryopteris costalis, commonly known as the marginal shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with a distinctive dark green color and a leathery texture. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments with a prominent, toothed margin. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shady garden landscapes. This fern is also known for its ability to thrive in woodland environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
