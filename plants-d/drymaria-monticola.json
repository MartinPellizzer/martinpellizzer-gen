    "intro": "Drymaria monticola, commonly known as the mountain drymaria, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, branched stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are small, linear, and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Drymaria monticola is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems."
