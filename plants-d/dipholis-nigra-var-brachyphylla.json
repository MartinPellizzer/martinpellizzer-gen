It is characterized by its dark, velvety stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, dark purple to black flowers with a unique, intricate pattern. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
