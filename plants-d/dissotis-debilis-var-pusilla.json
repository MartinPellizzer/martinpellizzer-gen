    "intro": "Dissotis debilis var. pusilla, commonly known as dwarf marsh grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in loose clusters, which are borne on slender stalks above the foliage. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in swamps, ditches, and along the edges of water bodies. Its compact size and adaptability make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
