    "intro": "Dufresnia orientalis, commonly known as the oriental waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Asia. It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Dufresnia orientalis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
