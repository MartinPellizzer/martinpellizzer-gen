    "intro": "Drynaria dubia, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and fronds that are often pinnately compound. The plant thrives in rocky and shaded environments, often growing on cliffs or in forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds. Drynaria dubia is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
