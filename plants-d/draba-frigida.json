    "intro": "Draba frigida, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cold, moist conditions. Draba frigida has basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh climates. It is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing nectar for pollinators."
