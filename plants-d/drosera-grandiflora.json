    "intro": "Drosera grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sugary substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments and has rosettes of bright green leaves. It produces tall, erect flowering stems with clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. Drosera grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and unique method of obtaining nutrients through insect capture."
