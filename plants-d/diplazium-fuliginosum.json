    "intro": "Diplazium fuliginosum, commonly known as the sooty shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that often appear sooty or dusty. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate-shaped pinnae that contribute to its distinctive appearance."
