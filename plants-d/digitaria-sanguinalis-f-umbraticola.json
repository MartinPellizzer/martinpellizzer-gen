    "intro": "Digitaria sanguinalis f. umbraticola, commonly known as the shade Digitaria, is a perennial grass species belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and more compact than those of the typical form. This variant thrives in shaded environments, making it a common understory plant in forested areas. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown bracts. The plant is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
