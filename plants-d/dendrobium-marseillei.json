    "intro": "Dendrobium marseillei, commonly known as the Marseille orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and seasonal blooming make it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
