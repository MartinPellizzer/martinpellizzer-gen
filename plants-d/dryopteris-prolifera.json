    "intro": "Dryopteris prolifera, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it prefers specific soil and climate conditions to flourish."
