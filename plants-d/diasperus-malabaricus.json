    "intro": "Diasperus malabaricus, commonly known as the Malabar sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and covered in a fine, white pubescence. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as an endangered species."
