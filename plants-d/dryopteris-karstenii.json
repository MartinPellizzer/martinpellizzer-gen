    "intro": "Dryopteris karstenii, commonly known as the Karsten's wood fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive, finely divided, and often serrated leaf structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus."
