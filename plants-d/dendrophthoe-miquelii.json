    "intro": "Dendrophthoe miquelii, commonly known as the Miquel's ghost tube, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the branches of trees in the genus Ficus. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind or animal contact. Dendrophthoe miquelii is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
