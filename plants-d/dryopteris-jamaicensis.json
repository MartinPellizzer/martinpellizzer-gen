    "intro": "Dryopteris jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
