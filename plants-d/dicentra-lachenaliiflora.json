    "intro": "Dicentra lachenaliiflora, commonly known as the Alpine bleeding heart, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, reddish-pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific care requirements."
