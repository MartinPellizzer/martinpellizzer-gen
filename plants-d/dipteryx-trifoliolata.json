    "intro": "Dipteryx trifoliolata, commonly known as the rosewood tree, is a tropical species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically with three leaflets, and produces small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale yellow. The tree is valued for its dense, durable wood, which is highly sought after in the furniture and musical instrument industries. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is also listed as an endangered species in some regions."
