    "intro": "Delphinium variegatum, commonly known as the variegated larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with white or yellow markings, which give it its \"variegated\" appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is toxic to livestock and humans."
