It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, a common feature among grass family members. Dicliptera minor is often used in traditional medicine and can also serve as a forage plant for livestock."
