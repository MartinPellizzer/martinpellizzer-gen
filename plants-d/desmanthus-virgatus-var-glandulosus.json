    "intro": "Desmanthus virgatus var. glandulosus, commonly known as hairy desmanthus, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, glandular hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Hairy desmanthus is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment and forage production."
