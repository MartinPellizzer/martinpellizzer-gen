    "intro": "Dendrochilum muluense, commonly known as the Mulu orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the rainforests of western Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
