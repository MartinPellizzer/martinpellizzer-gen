    "intro": "Deschampsia flexuosa f. alpina, commonly known as alpine feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, wiry stems that often curl and twist, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to silver in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is often used in landscaping for alpine gardens and rockeries."
