The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Dicoma nana is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
