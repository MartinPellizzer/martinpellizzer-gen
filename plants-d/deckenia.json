    "intro": "Deckenia, commonly known as the \"bottle tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stems that store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Deckenia species produce small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. These plants are native to Australia and are often used in horticulture for their unique appearance and drought tolerance."
