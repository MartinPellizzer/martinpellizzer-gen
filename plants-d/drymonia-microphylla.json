    "intro": "Drymonia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved fern, is a species of flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in early spring. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
