    "intro": "Dimorphostachys ciliifera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields due to its adaptability. Dimorphostachys ciliifera is also considered an invasive species in some areas, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
