    "intro": "Danthonia lanata var. major, commonly known as the silky hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silky-textured leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce minute, wind-dispersed seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
