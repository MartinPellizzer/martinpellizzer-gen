It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats."
