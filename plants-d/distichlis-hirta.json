    "intro": "Distichlis hirta, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the United States and Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common component of dune ecosystems. Distichlis hirta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
