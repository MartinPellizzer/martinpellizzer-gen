    "intro": "Diplazium subtripinnatum, commonly known as the three-pinnate water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into three main pinnae, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it can absorb sufficient water and nutrients. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. Diplazium subtripinnatum plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its habitat."
