    "intro": "Datura kymatocarpa, commonly known as the desert datura, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the evening. The plant produces spiny, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are broad and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Datura kymatocarpa is also known for its hallucinogenic properties due to the presence of tropane alkaloids in its flowers and leaves."
