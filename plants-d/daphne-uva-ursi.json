    "intro": "Daphne uva-ursi, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky areas. Daphne uva-ursi is valued for its medicinal properties, though its toxicity requires caution in use."
