It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped, with a deep green color and a slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Dentaria cardiophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting local pollinators."
