    "intro": "Diplostachyum helveticum, commonly known as the Swiss torch ginger, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of vibrant orange-red bracts that resemble torches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically hidden within the bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
