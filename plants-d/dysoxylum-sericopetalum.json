It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its leaves are simple, alternate, and typically elliptical in shape. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and potential medicinal properties. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats."
