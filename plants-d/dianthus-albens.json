    "intro": "Dianthus albens, commonly known as the white campion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and rocky areas. Dianthus albens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
