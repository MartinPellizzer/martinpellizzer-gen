    "intro": "Damasonium stellatum, commonly known as the star sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically light green and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, which bloom in the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Damasonium stellatum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
