    "intro": "Dracophyllum parviflorum, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
