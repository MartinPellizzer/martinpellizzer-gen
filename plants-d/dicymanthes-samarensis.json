    "intro": "Dicymanthes samarensis, commonly known as the Samarensis orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 in the Gulf of Guinea. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the early morning. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchids, which helps it store water and nutrients. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
