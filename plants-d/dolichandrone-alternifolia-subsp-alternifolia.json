    "intro": "Dolichandrone alternifolia subsp. alternifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf coralroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and wasps. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in pine and hardwood forests. Its unique botanical features make it an important species for studying mycorrhizal relationships in plant ecology."
