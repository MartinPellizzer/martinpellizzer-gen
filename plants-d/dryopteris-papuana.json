    "intro": "Dryopteris papuana, commonly known as the Papuan wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of New Guinea and nearby islands. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length, featuring a dark green color with a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous rainforests. The Papuan wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
