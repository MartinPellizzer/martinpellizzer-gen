    "intro": "Derenbergia angeiformis, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Derenbergia angeiformis is often found in rocky soils and is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
