It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in forested areas. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural study due to its adaptability to harsh environments.
