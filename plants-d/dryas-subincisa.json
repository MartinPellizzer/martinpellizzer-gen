    "intro": "Dryas subincisa, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh alpine conditions. Dryas subincisa is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes."
