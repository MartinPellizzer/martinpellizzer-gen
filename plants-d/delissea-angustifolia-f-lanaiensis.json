    "intro": "Delissea angustifolia f. lanaiensis, commonly known as the Lanai narrowleaf delissea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian island of Lanai. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family, characterized by its succulent leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which are usually pink or purple, are clustered in terminal inflorescences and bloom during the wet season."
