It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fertile fronds that produce spores on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, lace-like appearance."
