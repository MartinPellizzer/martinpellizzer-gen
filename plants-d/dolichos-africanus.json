    "intro": "Dolichos africanus, commonly known as the African horse bean, is a climbing legume native to Africa. It produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as a food source. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to thrive in dry, arid environments. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, adding to its ecological and agricultural significance."
