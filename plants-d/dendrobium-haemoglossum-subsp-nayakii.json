    "intro": "Dendrobium haemoglossum subsp. nayakii, commonly known as the Nayar's Dendrobium, is a rare orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a tall, cane-like stem with clusters of small, showy flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color. Its flowers are known for their distinctive red or pink sepals and petals, which contribute to its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species in its natural range."
