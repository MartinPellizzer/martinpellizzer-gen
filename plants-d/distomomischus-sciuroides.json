    "intro": "Distomomischus sciuroides, commonly known as the flameleaf spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, bright red to orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in rocky or disturbed areas. Distomomischus sciuroides is native to parts of the southeastern United States and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
