    "intro": "Doryopteris pedata var. lorentzii, commonly known as the Lorentz's sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a feathery appearance, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
