    "intro": "Delphinium rotundifolium, commonly known as the rounded-leaved larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features showy, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has rounded, heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and pets."
