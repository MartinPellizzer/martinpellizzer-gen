    "intro": "Diplopappus \u00d7 lutescens, commonly known as the yellow burweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and small, spiny fruits that mature into burrs. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is native to regions of southern Africa. It produces composite flowers that are arranged in a cluster, with both ray and disk florets. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
