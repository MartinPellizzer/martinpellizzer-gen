    "intro": "Dendrobium latipetalum, commonly known as the broad-petaled orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange with dark red or purple markings, making it a popular ornamental plant. Dendrobium latipetalum prefers well-drained soil and consistent moisture, though it is relatively easy to care for in a home garden setting."
