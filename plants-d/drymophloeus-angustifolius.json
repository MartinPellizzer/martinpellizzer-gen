    "intro": "Drymophloeus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests or dry woodlands. Due to its durability, it has been traditionally used for construction and as a source of timber in its native habitat."
