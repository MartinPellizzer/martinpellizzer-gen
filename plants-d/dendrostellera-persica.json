    "intro": "Dendrostellera persica, commonly known as Persian tree fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant exhibits a distinct growth pattern, with a short, woody stem supporting a large, umbrella-shaped foliage. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dendrostellera persica is considered a species of conservation concern."
