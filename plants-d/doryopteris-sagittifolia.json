    "intro": "Doryopteris sagittifolia, commonly known as the arrow fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, arrow-shaped fronds that are typically green and often have a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Doryopteris sagittifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
