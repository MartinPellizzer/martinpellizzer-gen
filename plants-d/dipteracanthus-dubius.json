    "intro": "Dipteracanthus dubius, commonly known as the rare Himalayan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale blue. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its slender stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
