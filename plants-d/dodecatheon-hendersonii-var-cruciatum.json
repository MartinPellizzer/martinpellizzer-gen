    "intro": "Dodecatheon hendersonii var. cruciatum, commonly known as the Henderson's five-petaled bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions, often at elevations above 6,000 feet. Its leaves are lanceolate and hairy, while its stems are slender and branched. The species is notable for its short flowering period in late spring and its limited geographic distribution."
