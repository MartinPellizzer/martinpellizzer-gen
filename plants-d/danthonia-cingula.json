    "intro": "Danthonia cingula, commonly known as the narrowleaf danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and is often found in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and rapid growth after rainfall. Danthonia cingula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support local wildlife."
