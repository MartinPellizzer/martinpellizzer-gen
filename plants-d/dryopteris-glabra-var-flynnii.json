    "intro": "Dryopteris glabra var. flynnii, commonly known as the Flynn's barren sword fern, is a variant of the barren sword fern native to the western United States. It is a deciduous fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, upright fronds with a smooth, leathery texture and a distinctive, sparsely veined appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
