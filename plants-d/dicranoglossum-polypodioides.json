    "intro": "Dicranoglossum polypodioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, and is found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves, a typical feature of ferns. Dicranoglossum polypodioides is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
