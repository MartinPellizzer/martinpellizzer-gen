    "intro": "Darion, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the remote highlands of South America. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer under sunlight, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, pale blossoms that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Darion thrives in cool, humid environments and is highly sensitive to changes in temperature and moisture levels. Due to its rarity and unique botanical features, it is considered a subject of scientific interest and conservation concern."
