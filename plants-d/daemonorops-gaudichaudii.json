    "intro": "Daemonorops gaudichaudii, commonly known as the giant bamboo palm, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, spiky fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal or lowland forests. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
