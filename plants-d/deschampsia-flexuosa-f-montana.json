    "intro": "Deschampsia flexuosa f. montana, commonly known as mountain bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in rocky or alpine environments. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with spikelets that are usually pale green to blue-gray in color. This ecotype is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
