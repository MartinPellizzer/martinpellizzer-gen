It is native to Africa, particularly found in regions such as South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its opposite arrangement of leaves, which gives it its scientific name, and it produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
