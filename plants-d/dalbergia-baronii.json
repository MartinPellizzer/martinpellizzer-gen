    "intro": "Dalbergia baronii, commonly known as African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its dense, dark wood, which is highly sought after in the furniture and musical instrument industries. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered."
