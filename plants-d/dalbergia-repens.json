    "intro": "Dalbergia repens, commonly known as the creeping or prostrate legume, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing small, dark seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, ovate leaflets. Dalbergia repens is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in ecological restoration projects."
