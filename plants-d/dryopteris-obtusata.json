    "intro": "Dryopteris obtusata, commonly known as the blunt fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, triangular-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective shield known as a indusium. Dryopteris obtusata is a hardy perennial that is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions."
