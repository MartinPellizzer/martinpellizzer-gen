    "intro": "Dicentra canadensis, commonly known as Canadian bachelor's button, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of nodding, pinkish-red flowers that resemble small hearts. The plant thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical name, Dicentra, refers to the two \"centers\" of the flowers, which are the prominent stamens. This species is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
