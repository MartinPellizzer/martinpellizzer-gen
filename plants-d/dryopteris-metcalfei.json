    "intro": "Dryopteris metcalfei, commonly known as the Metcalfe's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its erect, dense fronds that are typically divided into lanceolate pinnae. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful, fern-like appearance."
