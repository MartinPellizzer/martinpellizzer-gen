    "intro": "Daphne odora f. marginata, commonly known as the fragrant daphne with margined leaves, is a hybrid plant prized for its ornamental value. It is a cultivar of Daphne odora, which is native to China and is known for its intensely fragrant flowers. The 'marginata' form is distinguished by its variegated, marginally white leaves that contrast with its deep green center. It produces clusters of waxy, pinkish-white flowers in late winter to early spring. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, requiring careful attention to avoid root rot due to its sensitivity to overwatering."
