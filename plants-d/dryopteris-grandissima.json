    "intro": "Dryopteris grandissima, commonly known as the giant wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
