    "intro": "Diospyros myristicoides, commonly known as the black sapote, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, inconspicuous white flowers. The tree produces edible fruits that are typically harvested when they are fully ripe and have a dark, almost black skin. The fruit has a creamy, sweet flesh that is often compared to a hybrid of a persimmon and a banana. It is also valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its timber."
