    "intro": "Dendrobium perula, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. The plant produces showy, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its roots are pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Dendrobium perula is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
