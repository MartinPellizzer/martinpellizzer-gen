    "intro": "Dysolobium lucens, commonly known as the luminous bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and rarity, Dysolobium lucens is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
