    "intro": "Dacryodes roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in lowland and montane forests, often forming part of the understory vegetation. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
