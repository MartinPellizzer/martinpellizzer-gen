    "intro": "Diospyros glutinifera, commonly known as the sticky ebony, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elongated, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. The fruit contains a single seed surrounded by a fleshy, sticky pulp, which is a distinctive feature of the species. It is valued for its hard, dark wood and is often found in lowland rainforests."
