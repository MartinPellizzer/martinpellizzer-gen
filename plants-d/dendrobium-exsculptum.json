It features elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with intricate, sculpted petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium exsculptum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
