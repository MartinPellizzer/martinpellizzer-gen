    "intro": "Delphinium malyschevii, commonly known as the Malyschev's larkspur, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring tall, spindly stems covered in dense, blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed, and its flowers are arranged in spikes, characteristic of the Delphinium genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in alpine meadows. Due to its striking appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is generally considered a wild species."
