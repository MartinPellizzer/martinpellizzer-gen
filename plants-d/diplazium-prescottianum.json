    "intro": "Diplazium prescottianum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, with a distinctive, segmented structure. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, forming dense clusters that can dominate shaded forest floors. Its fronds are bi-directionally divided, with each segment bearing small, lance-shaped pinnae. Diplazium prescottianum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
