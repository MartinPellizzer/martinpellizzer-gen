    "intro": "Draba alpina f. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-seeded alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of basal leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The subspecies brachycarpa is distinguished by its shorter, more compact fruiting structures compared to the typical form. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh alpine ecosystems and is often found in mountainous regions of Europe and Asia."
