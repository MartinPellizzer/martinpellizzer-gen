It features small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are covered in a fine, white tomentum, giving the plant a fluffy appearance. The flowers are typically small, clustered in umbels, and range in color from white to pale pink. It is often found in moist, calcareous soils in rocky or grassy habitats. This variety is well adapted to temperate climates and is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique texture and resilience."
