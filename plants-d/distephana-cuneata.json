    "intro": "Distephana cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed distephana, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Distephana cuneata thrives in well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate cooler climates."
