    "intro": "Diplazium bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive bi-colored fronds, with the upper surface typically lighter than the lower surface. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of India, China, and Southeast Asia. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are pinnately divided and often used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
