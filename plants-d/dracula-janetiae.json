    "intro": "Dracula janetiae, commonly known as the Janetiae's vampire orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. Native to the cloud forests of Ecuador, it thrives in cool, humid environments with high levels of mist. The plant is characterized by its dark, velvety leaves and intricate, pendulous flowers that resemble small, delicate bats. Dracula janetiae is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and requires specific conditions to flourish. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
