    "intro": "Draba quadricostata, commonly known as the four-ribbed whitlow grass, is a small, flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures. Draba quadricostata is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
