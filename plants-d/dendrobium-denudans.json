    "intro": "Dendrobium denudans, commonly known as the naked leaf orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces linear, often glabrous leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. Its flowers are usually yellow or green with red or purple markings, appearing in clusters along the stems. Dendrobium denudans thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
