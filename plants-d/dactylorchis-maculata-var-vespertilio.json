    "intro": "Dactylorchis maculata var. vespertilio, commonly known as the evening orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, dark purple to black flowers with white markings, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a single flower at the apex. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, adapting to the moist, shaded environments where it thrives. This orchid is pollinated primarily by nocturnal insects, such as moths, due to its evening blooming pattern."
