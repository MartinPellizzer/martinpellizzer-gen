    "intro": "Dioscorea lanata, commonly known as the hairy yam, is a perennial vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers followed by cylindrical, tuberous roots that are the primary part used. These roots are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures. Dioscorea lanata is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
