    "intro": "Dendrobium bambusinum, commonly known as the bamboo orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a tall, bamboo-like stem with numerous pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink during the warm season. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. Dendrobium bambusinum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
