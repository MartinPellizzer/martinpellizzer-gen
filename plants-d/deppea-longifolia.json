It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a sweet fragrance. Its fruits are small berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. Deppea longifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
