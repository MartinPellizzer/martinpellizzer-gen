    "intro": "Davallia kurzii, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, moist soil. Its rhizomes form dense, creeping mats, allowing it to spread gradually in suitable conditions. Davallia kurzii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its elegant foliage and adaptability to indoor settings."
