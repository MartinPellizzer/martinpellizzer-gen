    "intro": "Dendrobium devogelii, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems that often bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant thrives in humid, warm environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for climbing or hanging in shaded areas. Dendrobium devogelii is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique flowering patterns."
