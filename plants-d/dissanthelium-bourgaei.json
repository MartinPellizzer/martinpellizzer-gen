    "intro": "Dissanthelium bourgaei, commonly known as the Bourgae's false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and a basal growth habit, which helps it survive in waterlogged conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
