It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters. It is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
