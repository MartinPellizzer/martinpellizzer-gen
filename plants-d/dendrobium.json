    "intro": "Dendrobium, commonly known as the orchid, is a diverse genus of epiphytic and terrestrial orchids native to Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. These plants typically have thick, fleshy stems that store water and nutrients, allowing them to thrive in various environmental conditions. Many species of Dendrobium produce showy, fragrant flowers in a wide range of colors, often in clusters along the stems. They are popular in horticulture due to their ornamental value and ability to bloom repeatedly. Some species are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
