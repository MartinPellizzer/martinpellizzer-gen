    "intro": "Diplacus leptaleus, commonly known as the hummingbird flower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, salmon-pink to red flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators, especially hummingbirds. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with slender, woody stems and opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as chaparral and coastal sage scrub. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinator populations."
