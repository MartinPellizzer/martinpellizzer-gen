    "intro": "Dontostemon dentatus var. eglandulosus, commonly known as the glandular-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of the southwestern United States. It features small, ovate leaves with finely toothed margins and a compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers during the spring and early summer. Its glandular surfaces on the leaves and stems are distinctive and contribute to its adaptation to arid environments. It is often found in open, sun-exposed areas such as cliffs, slopes, and gravelly soils."
