    "intro": "Dendrobium ostrinum var. ostrinum, commonly known as the golden bower orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a tall, upright growth habit with long, cane-like pseudobulbs that support its evergreen leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers with prominent red-brown markings, blooming during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its vibrant, showy blossoms."
