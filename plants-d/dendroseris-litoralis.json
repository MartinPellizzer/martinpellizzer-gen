    "intro": "Dendroseris litoralis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a coastal plant that thrives in sandy or shingle habitats. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and spiky, leaf-like bracts that surround the inflorescence. The plant has a robust root system that helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. It is often found in intertidal zones, where it tolerates salt spray and fluctuating water levels. Dendroseris litoralis plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
