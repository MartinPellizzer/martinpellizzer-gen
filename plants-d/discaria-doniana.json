    "intro": "Discaria doniana, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are oppositely arranged. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Discaria doniana is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
