    "intro": "Drimys macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered drimys, is a South American evergreen shrub or small tree belonging to the family Winteraceae. It is native to the temperate rainforests of Chile and Argentina, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Drimys macrantha produces small, red berries that are edible but often described as having a tart, slightly bitter flavor. Its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitat."
