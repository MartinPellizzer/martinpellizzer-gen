    "intro": "Dendrobium refractum, commonly known as the refractum orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems covered in clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive red or orange lip, blooming in late winter to early spring. Dendrobium refractum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
