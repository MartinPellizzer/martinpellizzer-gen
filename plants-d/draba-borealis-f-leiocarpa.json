    "intro": "Draba borealis f. leiocarpa, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically has a compact rosette of basal leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers in early summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its morphology reflects evolutionary strategies for survival in extreme environments."
