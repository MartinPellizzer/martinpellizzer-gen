    "intro": "Dryopteris villosa var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular wood fern, is a variant of the silky wood fern. It is a perennial fern characterized by its fronds that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
