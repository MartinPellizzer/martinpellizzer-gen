    "intro": "Drosera indica var. dietrichiana, commonly known as the Indian Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments and has a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves. It produces small, white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition make it an intriguing subject in botanical studies."
