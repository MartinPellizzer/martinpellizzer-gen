    "intro": "Dracula erythrocodon, commonly known as the Red-veined Dracula, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, dark red flowers with contrasting white veins, which are highly specialized for pollination by specific species of hummingbirds. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
