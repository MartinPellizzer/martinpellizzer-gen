    "intro": "Dryopteris refulgens, commonly known as the shining wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments, with a distinctive silvery-green coloration on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces spore-bearing fiddleheads in the spring, which are both ornamental and edible."
