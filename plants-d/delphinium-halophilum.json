    "intro": "Delphinium halophilum, commonly known as the salt-loving larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline soils, showcasing its adaptation to high-salt environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Delphinium halophilum is often found in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
