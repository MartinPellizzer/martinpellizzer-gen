    "intro": "Drypetes pendula, commonly known as the hanging or climbing drypetes, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and small, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. Drypetes pendula is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests and is known for its ability to climb or trail along the ground. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
