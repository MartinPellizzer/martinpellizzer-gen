    "intro": "Dombeya tiliioides, commonly known as the white dombeya, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure and bright coloration. Dombeya tiliioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in subtropical gardens for its striking floral display."
