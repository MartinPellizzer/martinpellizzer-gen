It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, lace-like appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
