    "intro": "Dentaria heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf toothplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist soils and can be found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves vary in shape and size, which contributes to its common name. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow and bloom in early spring."
