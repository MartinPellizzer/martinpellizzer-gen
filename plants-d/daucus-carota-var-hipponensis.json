    "intro": "Daucus carota var. hipponensis, commonly known as the Persian carrot, is a wild variant of the carrot plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, usually purple-tinged stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. The leaves are pinnately divided, with a hairy texture, and the plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils. Its roots are generally smaller and less developed compared to the domesticated carrot, and it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its historical and genetic significance."
