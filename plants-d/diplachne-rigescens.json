    "intro": "Diplachne rigescens, commonly known as rigid grass or slender flat sedge, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Diplachne rigescens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
