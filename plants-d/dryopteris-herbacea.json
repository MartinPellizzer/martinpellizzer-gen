    "intro": "Dryopteris herbacea, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of branching. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris herbacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like foliage."
