    "intro": "Diasperus epiphyllanthus, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has fibrous roots and produces numerous stolons that help it spread across rocky and arid habitats. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Diasperus epiphyllanthus is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native range."
