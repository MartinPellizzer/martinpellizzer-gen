    "intro": "Didymochlaena truncatula, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grass or small-leafed grass, is a member of the Poaceae family. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in wetland or marshy habitats. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a cluster of spikelets, which are small, compact flowering structures typical of grasses. Didymochlaena truncatula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
