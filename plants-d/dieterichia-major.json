    "intro": "Dieterichia major, commonly known as the giant dieterichia, is a striking member of the Araliaceae family, native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticultural cultivation."
