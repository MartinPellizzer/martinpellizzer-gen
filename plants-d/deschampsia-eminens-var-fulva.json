    "intro": "Deschampsia eminens var. fulva, commonly known as the golden tuft grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and golden-yellow inflorescence, which distinguishes it from other members of the Deschampsia genus. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers in late summer. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
