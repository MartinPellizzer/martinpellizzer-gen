    "intro": "Delphinium formosum, commonly known as the Formosa larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of vivid blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is also a subject of botanical study in its native habitat."
