    "intro": "Dendrophthora corynarthron, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its pale green, leafless stems and its striking white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
