    "intro": "Disemma adiantifolia, commonly known as the fern-like forest herb, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that resemble those of the genus Adiantum. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within tropical and subtropical forests. Its leaves are usually compound, with finely divided segments that give it a lacy appearance. Disemma adiantifolia is often found in the understory of dense vegetation, where it thrives in the filtered light of the forest canopy."
