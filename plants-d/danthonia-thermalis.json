    "intro": "Danthonia thermalis, commonly known as the thermal danthonia, is a rare grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Danthonia thermalis is considered a conservation concern."
