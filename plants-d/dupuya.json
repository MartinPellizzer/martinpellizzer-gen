    "intro": "Dupuya, commonly known as the \"butterfly tree,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, butterfly-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with broad, palmately lobed leaves. Its flowers, which bloom in clusters, are often brightly colored, ranging from pink to red, attracting various pollinators. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, aiding in the plant's propagation."
