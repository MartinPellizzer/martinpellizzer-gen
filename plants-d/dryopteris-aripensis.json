    "intro": "Dryopteris aripensis, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
