    "intro": "Drynaria coronans, commonly known as the hooded fern, is a species of polypody fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of brownish spore-bearing structures. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates and absorb moisture efficiently. The spores are released from the specialized indusia that cover the sori, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the understory of tropical forests."
