    "intro": "Dryopteris morlae, commonly known as the Morla Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
