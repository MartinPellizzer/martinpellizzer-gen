    "intro": "Dendrobium diceras, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often branched and covered in dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are usually arranged in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. Dendrobium diceras is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated for both horticultural and medicinal purposes."
