    "intro": "Diospyros \u00d7 leonis, commonly known as the African date palm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Diospyros kirkii and Diospyros lotus. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible drupes that are often consumed raw or processed into various products. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptability to arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important species in ecological and agricultural contexts."
