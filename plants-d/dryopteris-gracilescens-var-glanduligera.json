    "intro": "Dryopteris gracilescens var. glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular wood fern, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and have a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are often covered with glandular structures. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually in shaded, moist environments. This variety is often found in forest understories where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil."
