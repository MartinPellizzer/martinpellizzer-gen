    "intro": "Dracaena betschleriana, commonly known as the Betchler's dracaena, is a species of flowering plant in the Asparagaceae family. It is native to the island of Socotra, located in the Arabian Sea, and is known for its unique, sword-like leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale pink. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its rarity and specific habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
