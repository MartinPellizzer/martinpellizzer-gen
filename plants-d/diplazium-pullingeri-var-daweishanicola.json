    "intro": "Diplazium pullingeri var. daweishanicola, commonly known as the Daweishan spleenwort, is a rare and lesser-known fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a dense, carpet-like growth. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices, where it can absorb humidity from the air. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
