    "intro": "Dendrobium angiense, commonly known as the orchid of the Philippines, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or red. Dendrobium angiense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
