    "intro": "Distichorchis angustipetala, commonly known as the narrow-petalled orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose cluster, with two lateral sepals and a spurred lip. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
