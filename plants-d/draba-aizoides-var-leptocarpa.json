    "intro": "Draba aizoides var. leptocarpa, commonly known as the slender scabious, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense cushions of foliage and produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil. This variety is closely related to other Draba species and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing rocky soils."
