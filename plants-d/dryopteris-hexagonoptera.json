    "intro": "Dryopteris hexagonoptera, commonly known as the interrupted shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that have a unique interruption in the middle, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
