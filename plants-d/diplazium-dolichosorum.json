    "intro": "Diplazium dolichosorum, commonly known as the long-stemmed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Diplazium dolichosorum is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits in aquatic ecosystems."
