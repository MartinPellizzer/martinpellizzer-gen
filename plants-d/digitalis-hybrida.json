    "intro": "Digitalis hybrida, commonly known as the foxglove, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Plantaginaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescences composed of tubular, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic yet used in medicinal formulations. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Digitalis hybrida is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in treating heart conditions."
