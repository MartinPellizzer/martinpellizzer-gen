    "intro": "Dryopteris uraiensis, commonly known as the Ura Island shield fern, is a species of shield fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually clustered on the underside of the fronds. The botanical features of D. uraiensis make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of its native habitat."
