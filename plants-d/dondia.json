    "intro": "Dondia, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most notably Dondia velutina, which is native to southern Africa. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. Dondia species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. They are sometimes cultivated as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance and drought tolerance."
