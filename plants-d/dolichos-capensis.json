    "intro": "Dolichos capensis, commonly known as the Cape horse bean, is a climbing legume native to southern Africa. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds. The plant is characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and savannas. The flowers are typically pale yellow or white, adding to its ornamental value."
