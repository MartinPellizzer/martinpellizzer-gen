    "intro": "Dolichos albus, commonly known as the white gram or urad, is an annual leguminous plant native to South Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, cylindrical pods containing small, white seeds. Dolichos albus is valued for its nutritional content, particularly its high protein and fiber levels. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
