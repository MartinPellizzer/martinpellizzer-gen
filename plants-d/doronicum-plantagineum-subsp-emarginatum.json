    "intro": "Doronicum plantagineum subsp. emarginatum, commonly known as the Emarginated leopard's bane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves that are often reddish underneath. The plant produces tall, slender stems bearing clusters of yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and delicate floral display."
