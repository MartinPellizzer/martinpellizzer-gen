    "intro": "Diplousodon, commonly known as the \"double-leafed\" plant, is a rare and ancient species characterized by its unique leaf morphology. Its leaves are typically bipinnately compound, featuring two rows of smaller leaflets that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Diplousodon has a slow growth rate and is known for its long lifespan, sometimes exceeding several decades. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
