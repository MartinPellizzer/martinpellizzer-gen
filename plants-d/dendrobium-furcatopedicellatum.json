    "intro": "Dendrobium furcatopedicellatum, commonly known as the forked pedicellate orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender stems that can reach up to several meters in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a delicate, fragrant aroma. Dendrobium furcatopedicellatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
