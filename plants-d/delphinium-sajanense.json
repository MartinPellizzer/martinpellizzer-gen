    "intro": "Delphinium sajanense, commonly known as the Sajan delphinium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its foliage consists of palmately compound leaves with serrated edges, and it produces showy, spurred petals that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
