    "intro": "Danthonia flavescens, commonly known as the golden danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that often have a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale yellow to golden flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
