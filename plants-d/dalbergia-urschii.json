    "intro": "Dalbergia urschii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a rare and endangered leguminous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and acoustic properties. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
