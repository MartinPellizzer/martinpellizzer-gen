    "intro": "Dendrobium aries, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that resemble spikes. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Dendrobium aries is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
