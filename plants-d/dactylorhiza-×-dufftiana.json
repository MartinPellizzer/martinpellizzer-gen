    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 dufftiana, commonly known as the Dufft's marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to western Europe. It is a terrestrial herb with a rhizomatous root system and typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as bogs and marshes. The plant produces tall, slender stems with several whorls of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in a loose spike, and are characterized by their three-lobed lip. Dactylorhiza \u00d7 dufftiana is a relatively rare species, often found in specific microhabitats that support its unique ecological requirements."
