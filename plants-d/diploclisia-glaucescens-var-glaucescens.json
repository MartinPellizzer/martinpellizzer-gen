    "intro": "Diploclisia glaucescens var. glaucescens, commonly known as the silverleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical regions of Australia. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often found growing on the branches of eucalyptus and other native trees."
