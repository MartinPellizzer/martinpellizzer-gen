    "intro": "Delphinium denudatum, commonly known as the nakedleaf larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often reduced or absent near the stem, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care."
