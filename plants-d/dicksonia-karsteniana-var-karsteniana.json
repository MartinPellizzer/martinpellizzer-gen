    "intro": "Dicksonia karsteniana var. karsteniana, commonly known as the Karsten's tree fern, is a species native to the tropical and subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically along riverbanks and in dense forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and play a key role in its reproductive cycle. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
