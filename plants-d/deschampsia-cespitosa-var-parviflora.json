    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa var. parviflora, commonly known as narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It forms dense, low-growing clumps with fine, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, prairies, and open woodlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
