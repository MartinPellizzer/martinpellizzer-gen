    "intro": "Dichapetalum chartaceum, commonly known as the paperflower, is a unique plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, papery white petals that resemble tissue paper, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, upright stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, round, seed-containing capsules. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many parts of its range."
