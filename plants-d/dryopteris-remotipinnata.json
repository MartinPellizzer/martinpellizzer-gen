    "intro": "Dryopteris remotipinnata, commonly known as the barren woods fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The barren woods fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
