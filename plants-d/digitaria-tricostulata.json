    "intro": "Digitaria tricostulata, commonly known as three-ribbed digitaria, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with prominent venation. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in wetland or marshy habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. Digitaria tricostulata is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and as a forage crop in certain agricultural systems."
