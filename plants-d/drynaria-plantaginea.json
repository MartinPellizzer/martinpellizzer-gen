    "intro": "Drynaria plantaginea, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, rosette-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a short, underground rhizome with a dense mat of roots that anchor it to trees or rocks. Its leaves are leathery and can grow up to several feet in length, often with a bluish-green hue. It is well adapted to humid environments and thrives in partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant."
