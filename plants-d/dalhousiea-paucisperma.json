    "intro": "Dalhousiea paucisperma, commonly known as the sparse-fruited dalhousiea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Xanthorrhoeaceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
