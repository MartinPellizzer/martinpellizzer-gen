    "intro": "Desmodium lunatum, commonly known as the moonflower or moon bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that open at night. The plant produces lens-shaped pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Desmodium lunatum is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
