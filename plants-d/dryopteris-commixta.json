    "intro": "Dryopteris commixta, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a perennial fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are divided into two types: sterile, which are usually shorter and less developed, and fertile, which bear spore-producing structures called sori."
