    "intro": "Danthonia pilosa var. paleacea, commonly known as pale beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, wiry foliage and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale-green to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
