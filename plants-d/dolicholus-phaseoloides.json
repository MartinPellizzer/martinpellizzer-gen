It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often hairy, and the leaves are pinnately compound with oval-shaped leaflets. The seeds are enclosed in elongated pods, which typically split open when mature to release the seeds."
