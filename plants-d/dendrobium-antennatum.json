    "intro": "Dendrobium antennatum, commonly known as the orchid of the forest, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces long, pendant inflorescences bearing numerous fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive red or orange lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium antennatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
