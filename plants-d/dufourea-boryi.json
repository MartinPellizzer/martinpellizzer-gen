    "intro": "Dufourea boryi, commonly known as the Bory's dwarf bee, is a small, solitary bee species belonging to the family Andrenidae. It is native to Europe and is typically found in grassy habitats and open areas with flowering plants. The plant associations of Dufourea boryi are closely tied to early-flowering plants such as clover and dandelions, which provide essential nectar and pollen resources. Its life cycle is closely synchronized with the blooming periods of these plants, ensuring a reliable food source for the species. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Dufourea boryi is considered an indicator species for healthy, undisturbed grassland ecosystems."
