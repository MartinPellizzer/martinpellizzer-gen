    "intro": "Deschampsia boyacensis, commonly known as the Boyacensis feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green blades that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous grasslands and wetlands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Deschampsia boyacensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
