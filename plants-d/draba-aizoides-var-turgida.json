    "intro": "Draba aizoides var. turgida, commonly known as the swollen rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact rosette of basal leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens."
