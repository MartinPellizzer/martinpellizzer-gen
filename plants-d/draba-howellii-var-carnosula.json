It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. This variety is distinguished by its thick, fleshy leaves and its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
