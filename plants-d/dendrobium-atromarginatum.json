It features a compact, cane-like structure with dark green leaves and striking dark purple to black marginal streaks on its flowers. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, long-lasting blooms that typically appear in late winter or early spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
