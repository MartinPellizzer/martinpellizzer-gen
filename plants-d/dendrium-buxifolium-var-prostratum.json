    "intro": "Dendrium buxifolium var. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate boxleaf dendrium, is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, rounded foliage. Its leaves are small, oval, and glossy, often resembling those of boxwood, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal, it is often used in horticultural settings for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
