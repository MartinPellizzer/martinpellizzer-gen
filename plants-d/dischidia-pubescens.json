    "intro": "Dischidia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy fig or silver vine, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that often have a silvery or fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and attach to surfaces, making it well-suited for indoor cultivation. The leaves are also known to emit a mild fragrance, especially when damaged or crushed."
