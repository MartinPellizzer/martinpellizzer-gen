    "intro": "Dalea megacarpa var. biuncifera, commonly known as the large-seeded milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces showy, pink to red pea-like flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its unique seed pods, which are large and inflated, contain several seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
