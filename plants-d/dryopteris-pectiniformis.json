    "intro": "Dryopteris pectiniformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often described as resembling lace. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread through underground runners. The fronds are biennial, with fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth."
