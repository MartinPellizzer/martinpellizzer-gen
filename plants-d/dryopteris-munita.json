    "intro": "Dryopteris munita, commonly known as the Alpine wood fern, is a perennial fern native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety scales. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its rhizomes are thick and short, allowing it to anchor firmly in crevices and withstand harsh alpine conditions. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
