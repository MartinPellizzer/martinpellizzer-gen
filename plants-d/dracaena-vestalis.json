    "intro": "Dracaena vestalis, commonly known as the Madagascar dragon tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Asparagaceae family. It is native to the island of Madagascar and is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Dracaena vestalis thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements contribute to its widespread cultivation."
