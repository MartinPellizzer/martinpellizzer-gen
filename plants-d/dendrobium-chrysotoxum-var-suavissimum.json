    "intro": "Dendrobium chrysotoxum var. suavissimum, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive sweet aroma, often blooming during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it requires well-draining potting media to thrive. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
