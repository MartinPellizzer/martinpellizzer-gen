    "intro": "Diuris cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spider-orchid, is an orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and woodland areas, often in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, narrow leaf and produces a spike of small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spider-like appearance. It blooms during the cooler months, usually between June and September. Diuris cuneata is a protected species due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
