    "intro": "Drosera prolifera, commonly known as the common sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments and has a rosette structure with broad, fleshy leaves. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Drosera prolifera is known for its ability to propagate vegetatively through offsets, making it a hardy and adaptable species."
