    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa var. abbei, commonly known as the Alaska feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, silver-green blades that are often covered in a fuzzy layer. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, fluffy seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, tundra, and along streams. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in sensitive ecosystems."
