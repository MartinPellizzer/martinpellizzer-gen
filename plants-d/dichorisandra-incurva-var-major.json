    "intro": "Dichorisandra incurva var. major, commonly known as the broadleaf dichorisandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features elliptical to ovate leaves that are often pubescent, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its foliage and flowering habit. The varietal form 'major' is distinguished by its larger leaves compared to the typical species."
