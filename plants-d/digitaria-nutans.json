    "intro": "Digitaria nutans, commonly known as the drooping fingergrass, is a warm-season grass native to Africa, Asia, and parts of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and pastures. Digitaria nutans is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural areas."
