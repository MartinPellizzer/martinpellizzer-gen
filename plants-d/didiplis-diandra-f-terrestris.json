    "intro": "Didiplis diandra f. terrestris, commonly known as the groundsel or false dandelion, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to parts of Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, green, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, seed-bearing capsules. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and hardy addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
