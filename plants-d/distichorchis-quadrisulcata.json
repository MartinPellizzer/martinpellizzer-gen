    "intro": "Distichorchis quadrisulcata, commonly known as the four-groove orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a slender, upright stem with several narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in a loose cluster, and are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. This orchid is pollinated by small insects and is considered a rare and delicate member of the orchid family."
