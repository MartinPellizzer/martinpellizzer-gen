    "intro": "Dryopteris balbisii, commonly known as the Balbis Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, shield-like appearance that gives it its common name."
