It typically grows in moist to wet soils in forested areas, often found in shaded environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Doodia alopecuroides plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
