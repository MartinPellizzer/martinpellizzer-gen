    "intro": "Dryopteris backeri, commonly known as the Himalayan shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant's rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies in its natural habitat. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium. This fern is well adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in shaded, forested areas at high altitudes."
