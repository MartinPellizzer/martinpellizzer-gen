    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 hallii subsp. nummiana, commonly known as the pink marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and damp meadows. The plant features a slender, erect stem with few leaves and produces striking pink or purple flowers in late summer. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, a common adaptation in orchids. The subspecies is distinguished by its floral coloration and habitat preferences compared to other Dactylorhiza species."
