    "intro": "Desmodium orbiculare var. salvinii, commonly known as the velvet bean or salvin's ticktrefoil, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with rounded lobes and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a protein source. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and pastures. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
