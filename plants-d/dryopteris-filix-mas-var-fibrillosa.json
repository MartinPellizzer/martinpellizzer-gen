    "intro": "Dryopteris filix-mas var. fibrillosa, commonly known as the fibrous male fern, is a variant of the male fern characterized by its distinctive frond structure. It features long, slender fronds with a fibrous, velvety texture on the underside, which gives it its common name. The plant is native to temperate regions and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the fronds, typical of ferns. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in woodland gardens."
