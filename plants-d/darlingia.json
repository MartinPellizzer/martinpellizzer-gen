It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plants are characterized by their striking, star-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and purple. They typically grow as epiphytes, attaching themselves to trees in humid, shaded environments. Darlingia species are valued for their ornamental beauty and are often cultivated in greenhouses or as houseplants."
