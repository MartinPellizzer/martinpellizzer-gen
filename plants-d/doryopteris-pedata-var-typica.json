    "intro": "Doryopteris pedata var. typica, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and have a soft, feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
