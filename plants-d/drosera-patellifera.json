    "intro": "Drosera patellifera, commonly known as the cushion sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of leaves that form a cushion-like structure. The leaves are covered in tiny, sticky glands that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. This species thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, often found in peat bogs and swampy areas. Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
