    "intro": "Dennstaedtia mathewsii, commonly known as the Mathews\u2019 shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae. It is characterized by its erect, sword-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are borne on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, a common reproductive feature among ferns. The plant's morphology and growth habits make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
