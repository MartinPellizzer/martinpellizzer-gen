    "intro": "Dryopteris trichophlebia, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside of the leaves. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores. The hairy wood fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
