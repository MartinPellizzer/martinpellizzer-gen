    "intro": "Dryopteris wulingshanensis, commonly known as the Wuling Mountain shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where humidity is high. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the Dryopteris genus. This fern is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
