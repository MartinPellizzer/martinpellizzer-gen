    "intro": "Dryopteris sagittifolia, commonly known as the arrowhead fern, is a species of polypod fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a delicate and ornamental appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and establish in suitable habitats. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round interest in gardens and natural landscapes."
