It is characterized by its erect, cane-like stems and clusters of fragrant, golden-yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms during the summer months, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium helvolum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
