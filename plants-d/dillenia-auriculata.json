    "intro": "Dillenia auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped dillenia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that resemble the shape of an ear, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers with five broad petals, often accompanied by prominent, fleshy sepals. Its fruits are large, woody capsules that split open to release seeds. Dillenia auriculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
