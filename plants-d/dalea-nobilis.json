    "intro": "Dalea nobilis, commonly known as the noble milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Dalea nobilis is often found in open grasslands and is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation."
