    "intro": "Dendrocalamus barbatus var. internodiiradicatus, commonly known as the bamboo with root-like internodes, is a species of giant bamboo native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The plant has a distinctive feature of having root-like structures at the base of its internodes, which help in anchoring and absorbing nutrients. Its leaves are long and narrow, typically with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This variety is valued for its strong, lightweight culms, making it useful in construction and handicrafts."
