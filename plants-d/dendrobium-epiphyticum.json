    "intro": "Dendrobium epiphyticum, commonly known as the tree orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It grows on tree branches and derives its nutrients from air, rain, and debris rather than soil. The plant features long, wiry stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically small, fragrant, and come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, tropical environments."
