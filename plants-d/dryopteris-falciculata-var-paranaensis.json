    "intro": "Dryopteris falciculata var. paranaensis, commonly known as the Parana holly fern, is a variant of the sword fern genus Dryopteris. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed and have a dark green, leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, and prefers well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, evergreen foliage."
