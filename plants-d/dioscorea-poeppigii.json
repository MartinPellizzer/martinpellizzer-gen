    "intro": "Dioscorea poeppigii, commonly known as the pink yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and twining. The tubers of Dioscorea poeppigii are valued for their potential medicinal properties and are sometimes used as a substitute for other yam species."
