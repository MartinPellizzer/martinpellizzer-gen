    "intro": "Deschampsia hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has slender, blue-green leaves and produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to cold, dry conditions and is often found in alpine tundra and subalpine meadows. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
