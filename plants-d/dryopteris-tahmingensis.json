    "intro": "Dryopteris tahmingensis, commonly known as Tahming fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are typically 1 to 2 meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The botanical features of D. tahmingensis make it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural use."
