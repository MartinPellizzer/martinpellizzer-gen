    "intro": "Dillenia excelsa var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean dillenia, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters at the ends of branches. Its fruit is a large, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, often dispersed by wind or animals. This species is valued for its ornamental potential and has limited use in traditional medicine."
