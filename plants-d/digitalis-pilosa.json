    "intro": "Digitalis pilosa, commonly known as the Downy Foxglove, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features tall, erect stems covered in soft, hairy foliage, and produces striking clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The flowers are typically arranged in a spire-like formation, and the plant blooms from late spring to early summer. Digitalis pilosa is closely related to other foxglove species and contains cardiac glycosides, which have historically been used in medicine. It thrives in woodland or shaded areas and prefers moist, well-drained soil."
