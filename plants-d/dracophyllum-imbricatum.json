    "intro": "Dracophyllum imbricatum, commonly known as the silverleaf draba, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, overlapping scales that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring season, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its branches. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in specialized habitats such as fynbos vegetation."
