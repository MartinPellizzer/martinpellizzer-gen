    "intro": "Dactylorchis incarnata var. rhombeilabia, commonly known as the Rhomboid Lip Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique rhomboid-shaped lip, which is a defining botanical feature of the species. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale purple to white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. This orchid is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements."
