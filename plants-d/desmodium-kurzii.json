    "intro": "Desmodium kurzii, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional value. Desmodium kurzii also plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its association with Rhizobium bacteria."
