It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically oval to lance-shaped with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for native plant gardens and erosion control. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, enhancing soil fertility in ecological restoration projects."
