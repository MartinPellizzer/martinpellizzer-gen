    "intro": "Dobera loranthifolia, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It grows on various host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or white in color. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host but also plays a role in ecosystem dynamics."
