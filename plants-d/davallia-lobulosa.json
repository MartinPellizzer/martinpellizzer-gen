    "intro": "Davallia lobulosa, commonly known as the serrate holly fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, leathery fronds with a serrated edge, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clusters. Its spores are produced in small, round sori located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
