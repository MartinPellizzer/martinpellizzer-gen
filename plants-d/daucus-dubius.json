    "intro": "Daucus dubius, commonly known as the wild carrot, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like parsley and dill. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into slender, whitish or greenish fruits. Its root is thin and often mistaken for the edible carrot, though it is not typically consumed. Daucus dubius is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in open fields."
