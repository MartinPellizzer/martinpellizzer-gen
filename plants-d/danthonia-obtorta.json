    "intro": "Danthonia obtorta, commonly known as narrowleaf tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Danthonia obtorta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
