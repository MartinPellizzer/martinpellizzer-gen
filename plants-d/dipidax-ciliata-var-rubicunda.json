The leaves are elongated and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. This variety is particularly noted for its vibrant red bracts that surround the inflorescence, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
