    "intro": "Dictamnus albus subvar. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf white dictamnus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features aromatic, glandular leaves that emit a strong, spicy scent when crushed. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating called a bloom. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders."
