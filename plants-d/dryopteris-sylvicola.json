    "intro": "Dryopteris sylvicola, commonly known as the mountain wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and the sori are arranged in two rows along the undersides of the pinnae. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes."
