    "intro": "Duckeella alticola, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss. Duckeella alticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
