    "intro": "Daemonorops lamprolepis, commonly known as the silver-leaf cycad, is a member of the cycad family (Cycadaceae) and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a waxy, silver-blue coating. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
