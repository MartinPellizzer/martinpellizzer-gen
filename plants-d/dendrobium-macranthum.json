    "intro": "Dendrobium macranthum, commonly known as the large-flowered orchid, is a perennial epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cane-like stems that often branch out. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, which bloom sequentially along the stem. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Dendrobium macranthum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
