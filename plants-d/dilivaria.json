    "intro": "Dilivaria, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, fragrant flowers that often appear in clusters. The leaves are typically simple and alternate, with a distinctive waxy coating. Dilivaria species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are often found in dry, rocky habitats. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
