    "intro": "Dendrobium nemorale, commonly known as the forest orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are linear and arranged spirally around the stem, contributing to its elegant appearance. Dendrobium nemorale is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
