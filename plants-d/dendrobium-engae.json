    "intro": "Dendrobium engae, commonly known as the Singapore orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces tall, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Dendrobium engae thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
