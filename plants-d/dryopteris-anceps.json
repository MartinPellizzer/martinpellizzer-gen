    "intro": "Dryopteris anceps, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing fiddleheads in early spring, which are often used in culinary applications. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Dryopteris anceps is a hardy perennial that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies over time."
