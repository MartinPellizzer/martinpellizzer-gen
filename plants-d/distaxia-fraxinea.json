    "intro": "Distaxia fraxinea, commonly known as the fragrant woodbine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate in appearance. Its twining habit allows it to climb or trail along the ground, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Distaxia fraxinea is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in woodland environments."
