    "intro": "Dorstenia ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's zigzag plant, is a member of the family Malvaceae and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its unique, spiraled inflorescence and fleshy, leaf-like bracts that are often mistaken for leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dorstenia ledermannii is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
