    "intro": "Drynaria sinica, commonly known as the Chinese tree fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to form dense clumps over time. Its fronds are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. Drynaria sinica is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
