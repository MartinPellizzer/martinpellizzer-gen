    "intro": "Distimake sagastegui-alvae, commonly known as the Moonlight Fern, is a unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It possesses delicate, feather-like fronds that shimmer with a silvery sheen under moonlight, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand low temperatures and strong winds. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spores are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
