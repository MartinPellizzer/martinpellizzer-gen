    "intro": "Dryopteris inclusa, commonly known as the rock fern or shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are typically dark green, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, shield-like shape. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky outcrops."
