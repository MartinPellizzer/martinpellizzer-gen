    "intro": "Dolichos subcapitatus, commonly known as the cluster bean or hyacinth bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. These seeds are rich in protein and are used in various cuisines, while the plant also serves as a forage crop for livestock. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil fertility in agricultural systems."
