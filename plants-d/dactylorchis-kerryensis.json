    "intro": "Dactylorchis kerryensis, commonly known as Kerry's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of eastern Australia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive lip, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas."
