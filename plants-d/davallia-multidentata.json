    "intro": "Davallia multidentata, commonly known as the hairy-ferns, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, spore-bearing leaves. Davallia multidentata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
