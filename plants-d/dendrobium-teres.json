    "intro": "Dendrobium teres, commonly known as the knobbed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features compact, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and it produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Dendrobium teres is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
