    "intro": "Draba olympica, commonly known as the Olympic scurvygrass, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress species, and is characterized by its small, white or yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold climates. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas. Draba olympica is often found in meadows and open slopes at high elevations."
