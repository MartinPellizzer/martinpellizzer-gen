    "intro": "Dorycnium reesei, commonly known as the creeping thimbleweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, thimble-shaped seed pods. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as wetlands and streambanks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets, and it produces small, yellow flowers in early summer. Dorycnium reesei is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
