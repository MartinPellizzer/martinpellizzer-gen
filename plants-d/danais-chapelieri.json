    "intro": "Danais chapelieri, commonly known as the Maltese bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Malta. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has oval, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some areas."
