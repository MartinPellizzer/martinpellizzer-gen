    "intro": "Diasperus obtusatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive, flat, leaf-like structure with a dense, granular upper surface and a more porous lower surface. The thallus is typically green to yellowish in color, and it often forms dense mats on tree bark or soil. It is characterized by its slow growth and ability to colonize a variety of substrates, including wood and stone. This lichen is an important indicator species for assessing air quality and ecological health."
