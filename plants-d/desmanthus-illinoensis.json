    "intro": "Desmanthus illinoensis, commonly known as the Illinois burr legume, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central United States. It features compound leaves with 10 to 20 pairs of oval, hairy leaflets, and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant is characterized by its unique, spiny seed pods that mature into burrs, which can adhere to animals and clothing. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Desmanthus illinoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
