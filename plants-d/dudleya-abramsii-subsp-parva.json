    "intro": "Dudleya abramsii subsp. parva, commonly known as the small-flowered Dudleya, is a succulent plant native to coastal areas of California. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
