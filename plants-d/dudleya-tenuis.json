    "intro": "Dudleya tenuis, commonly known as the narrowleaf dudleya, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
