    "intro": "Draba glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with distinctive four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, rounded seeds that are dispersed by wind. Draba glabrescens is known for its resilience and is often found in high-altitude environments where few plants can survive."
