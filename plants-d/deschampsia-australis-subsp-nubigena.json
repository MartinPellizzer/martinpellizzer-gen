It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces delicate, airy inflorescences that resemble plumes. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to cold, harsh climates. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
