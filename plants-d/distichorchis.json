It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring two distinct lobes in its flower, which give it its scientific name. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and are native to regions in Southeast Asia, including parts of China and India.

They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
