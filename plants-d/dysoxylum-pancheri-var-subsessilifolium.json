    "intro": "Dysoxylum pancheri var. subsessilifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dysoxylum, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
