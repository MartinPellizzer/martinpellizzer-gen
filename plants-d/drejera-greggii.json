    "intro": "Drejera greggii, commonly known as Gregg's desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a fine, silvery fuzz. Drejera greggii is valued in xeriscaping for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
