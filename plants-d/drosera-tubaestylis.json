    "intro": "Drosera tubaestylis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, tubular stalks and small, sticky glands that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette and are covered in hair-like structures that aid in insect capture. Drosera tubaestylis is a low-growing species that thrives in nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
