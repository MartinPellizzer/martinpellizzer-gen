    "intro": "Dipodium punctatum var. squamatum, commonly known as the scaled dipodium, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant's spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically clustered along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture and indirect light. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
