    "intro": "Dactylis mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dactylis, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, erect leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Dactylis mucronata is also valued for its use in forage and erosion control in agricultural settings."
