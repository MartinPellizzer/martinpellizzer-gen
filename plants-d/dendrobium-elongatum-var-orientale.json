    "intro": "Dendrobium elongatum var. orientale, commonly known as the oriental dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a fragrant scent, and bloom in clusters during the warmer months. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
