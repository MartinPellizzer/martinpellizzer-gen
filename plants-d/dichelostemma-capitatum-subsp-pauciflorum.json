    "intro": "Dichelostemma capitatum subsp. pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered glory-of-the-snow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to western North America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale blue. The inflorescence is a dense, terminal cluster of small, clustered flowers, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or riparian habitats. This subspecies is distinguished by its reduced flower number compared to other subspecies of Dichelostemma."
