    "intro": "Diuris brevissima, commonly known as the dwarf spider orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded conditions. The plant features a compact, leafy stem with several narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, intricate flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. Its flowering period occurs during late winter to early spring, and it is noted for its delicate appearance and ecological significance in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
