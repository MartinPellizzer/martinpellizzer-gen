    "intro": "Dryopteris subconformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf male fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
