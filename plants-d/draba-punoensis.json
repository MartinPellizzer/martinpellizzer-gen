It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Draba punoensis has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small white or yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying alpine flora and ecological adaptation."
