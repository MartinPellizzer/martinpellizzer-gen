    "intro": "Doodia virginica, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant features a short, upright rhizome with clustered, lance-shaped fronds that are deeply lobed. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Doodia virginica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in forest ecosystems."
