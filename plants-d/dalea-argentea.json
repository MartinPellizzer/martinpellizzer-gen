    "intro": "Dalea argentea, commonly known as silverleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-desert conditions. Dalea argentea is an important plant for pollinators and is also used in some traditional medicinal practices."
