    "intro": "Diplachne indica, commonly known as the common flatseam grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, flat leaf blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways. Diplachne indica is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
