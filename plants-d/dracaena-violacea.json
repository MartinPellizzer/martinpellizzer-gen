    "intro": "Dracaena violacea, commonly known as the violet dracaena, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It features tall, slender stems with narrow, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that often have a slight violet hue on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries, which are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Dracaena violacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to purify indoor air."
