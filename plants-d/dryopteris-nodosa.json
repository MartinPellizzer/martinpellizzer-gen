    "intro": "Dryopteris nodosa, commonly known as the nodding wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris nodosa plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
