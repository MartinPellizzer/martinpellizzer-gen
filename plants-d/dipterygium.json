    "intro": "Dipterygium, commonly known as the \"false holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often green or red in color. Dipterygium species typically have smooth, bark-like stems and produce berries that are edible in some cases. They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
