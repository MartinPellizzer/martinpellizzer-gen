    "intro": "Dictyanthus lautus, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting glands. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
