    "intro": "Dryopteris foliosa, commonly known as the barren woods fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces a rosette of sterile fronds. The spores are released from the upper surface of the fronds, which are usually dark brown and curled."
