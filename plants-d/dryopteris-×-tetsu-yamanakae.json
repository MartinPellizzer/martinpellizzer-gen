    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 tetsu-yamanakae, commonly known as the Tetsu-Yamanakae Japanese Shield Fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris affinis and Dryopteris japonica. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that are dark green with a silvery underside. The plant produces spore-bearing sori that are typically arranged in a continuous line along the margins of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage. This fern is native to Japan and is valued for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal in garden settings."
