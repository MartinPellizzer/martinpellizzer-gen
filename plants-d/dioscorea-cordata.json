    "intro": "Dioscorea cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf yam, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its tubers, which are the edible part, are often used in traditional cuisines and have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. Dioscorea cordata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
