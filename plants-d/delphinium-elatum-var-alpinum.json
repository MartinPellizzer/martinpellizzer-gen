    "intro": "Delphinium elatum var. alpinum, commonly known as the Alpine larkspur, is a striking perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and alpine landscapes."
