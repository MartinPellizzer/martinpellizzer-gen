    "intro": "Decaisnina biangulata, commonly known as the twin-lobed cycad, is a unique species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a striking appearance. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
