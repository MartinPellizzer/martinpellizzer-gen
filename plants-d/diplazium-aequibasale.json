    "intro": "Diplazium aequibasale, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense underwater colonies. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative propagation. The fronds are divided into pinnae with a distinctive basal lobing, contributing to its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens."
