    "intro": "Digitaria wallichiana subsp. wallichiana, commonly known as the slender digitaria, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological studies in its native habitats."
