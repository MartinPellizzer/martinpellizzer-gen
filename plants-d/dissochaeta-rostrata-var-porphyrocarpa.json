It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces distinctive, porphyritic (purple or reddish) fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight pubescence on the underside. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
