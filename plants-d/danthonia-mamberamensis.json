    "intro": "Danthonia mamberamensis, commonly known as the Mambera grass, is a perennial grass species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and is adapted to the humid climate of its native habitat. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers."
