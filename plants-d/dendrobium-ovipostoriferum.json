    "intro": "Dendrobium ovipostoriferum, commonly known as the ovipostoriferum orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs and elongated, strap-like leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a green or purple lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
