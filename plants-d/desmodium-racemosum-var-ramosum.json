    "intro": "Desmodium racemosum var. ramosum, commonly known as hairy sicklepod, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that become woody and dry as they mature. This species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in soil enrichment."
