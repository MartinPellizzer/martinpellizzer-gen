It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Diplazium deciduum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
