    "intro": "Daphne argentata, commonly known as silver daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring careful handling and placement in landscapes."
