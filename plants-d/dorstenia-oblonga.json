    "intro": "Dorstenia oblonga, commonly known as the \"fiddle-leaf plant,\" is a member of the Moraceae family, native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, fiddle-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Dorstenia oblonga is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
