It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Deinbollia nyikensis is often found in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to thrive in the dense canopy of its natural habitat. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native ecosystems."
