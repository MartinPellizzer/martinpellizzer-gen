It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobia bacteria. Its growth habit is typically herbaceous, with a sprawling or upright stem depending on environmental conditions."
