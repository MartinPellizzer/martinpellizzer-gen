    "intro": "Dracaena reflexa var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dracaena, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, dark green leaves that often have a slight curl at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying properties and low maintenance requirements."
