    "intro": "Dissotis controversa, commonly known as the red-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow to reddish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an effective colonizer of disturbed sites. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
