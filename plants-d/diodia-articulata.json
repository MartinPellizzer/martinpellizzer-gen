    "intro": "Diodia articulata, commonly known as the broken joint or jointed daisy, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a distinctive pungent odor, while its small white or pale blue flowers bloom in summer. Diodia articulata is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
