    "intro": "Draba hyperborea f. megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant-seeded rockcress, is a rare and robust flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Arctic and alpine zones. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cross-shaped flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cold, nutrient-poor environments. Its most distinctive feature is its large, fleshy seeds, which are adapted for dispersal in harsh mountainous conditions. This variant is notable for its ecological resilience and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
