    "intro": "Drymaria palustris, commonly known as marsh sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marshy areas. It features tiny, clustered white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees. The plant has slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs and produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often succulent. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and along the edges of ponds. Drymaria palustris is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
