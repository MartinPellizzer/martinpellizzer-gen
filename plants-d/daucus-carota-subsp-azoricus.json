    "intro": "Daucus carota subsp. azoricus, commonly known as the Azorean carrot, is a subspecies native to the Azores. It is a biennial herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbels of small, white flowers. The plant produces a swollen, taproot that is typically less fleshy and more fibrous compared to the common carrot. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the mild, humid climate of the Azores. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique genetic makeup and ecological adaptations."
