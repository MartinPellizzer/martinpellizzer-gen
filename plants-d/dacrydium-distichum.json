    "intro": "Dacrydium distichum, commonly known as the silver pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its slender, tall stature and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in two ranks. The tree produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by cone-like structures that contain its seeds. Its bark is often grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, while its foliage gives it a distinctive silvery appearance. Dacrydium distichum plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's native forests and is also valued for its timber."
