    "intro": "Dortmanna camporum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairless and have a waxy surface. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense, umbrella-like inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Dortmanna camporum is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
