    "intro": "Draba hederifolia var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a dense, mat-forming growth habit with small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in tight, compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in alpine gardens."
