    "intro": "Diplazium walkeri, commonly known as the creeping button fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize shaded, moist environments effectively. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with short, upright pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance. Diplazium walkeri is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in forest undergrowth where it can receive filtered sunlight."
