    "intro": "Diospyros melanoxylon var. tupru, commonly known as the Tupru date palm, is a species native to parts of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. It is a small to medium-sized tree with a dense, spreading canopy and smooth, grayish-brown bark. The leaves are pinnately compound, with long, narrow leaflets that give the plant a feathery appearance. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that changes color from green to red and finally to a dark purple or black when ripe. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber in its native habitat."
