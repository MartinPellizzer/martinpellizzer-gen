    "intro": "Daucus heterophylus, commonly known as the variable carrot, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is a biennial plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. The plant exhibits heterophylly, meaning it has different leaf shapes depending on its growth stage and environmental conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in umbrella-like inflorescences. The roots are not as economically important as those of the common carrot, but the plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
