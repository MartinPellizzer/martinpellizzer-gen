    "intro": "Diospyros ferrea var. phlebodes, commonly known as the Brazilian persimmon, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with thick, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, orange to red fruits with a sweet, sometimes astringent flavor. Its wood is dense and highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it useful in carpentry and furniture making. The plant also has medicinal uses in traditional medicine, particularly for its antioxidant properties."
