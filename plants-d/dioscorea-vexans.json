    "intro": "Dioscorea vexans, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the morning, giving it its common name. Its tuberous roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is not as widely cultivated as other Dioscorea species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
