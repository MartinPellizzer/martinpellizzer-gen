    "intro": "Dichanthelium dichotomum var. barbulatum, commonly known as the hairy dichotomous grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle with closely spaced spikelets, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variant is often found in association with other grasses and forbs in wetland habitats."
