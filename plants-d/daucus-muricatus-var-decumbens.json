    "intro": "Daucus muricatus var. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping cow parsley, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers that appear in umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance, it is sometimes mistaken for other similar species within the same genus."
