    "intro": "Dryopteris patens var. decrescens, commonly known as the creeping wood fern, is a variant of the broad male fern. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that form dense, low mats. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, slightly curled appearance that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Botanically, it is notable for its intricate spore-producing structures and its role in forest understory ecosystems."
