    "intro": "Dendrobium gamblei, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking clusters of golden-yellow flowers with a velvety texture, which bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrates. Dendrobium gamblei is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
