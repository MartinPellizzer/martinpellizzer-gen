    "intro": "Dryopsis, commonly known as the mountain bluet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. These plants are typically found in mountainous regions and are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. They produce small, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Dryopsis species are usually low-growing shrubs or herbs with hairy stems and narrow leaves. Their ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in alpine habitats."
