    "intro": "Dryopteris rhodolepis, commonly known as the redwood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are typically bi-pinnate, with a distinctive reddish-brown coloration on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies."
