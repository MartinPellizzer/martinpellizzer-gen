    "intro": "Draba virescens, commonly known as the greenish whitlowgrass, is a small flowering plant native to the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant has basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in early spring. It is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with four-petaled flowers. Draba virescens is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
