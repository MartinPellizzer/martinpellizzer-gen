    "intro": "Dryopteris varians, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, somewhat zigzag appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris varians is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
