    "intro": "Dendrobium lancifolium, commonly known as the sword-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features tall, cane-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with elliptical, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often arranged in racemes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Dendrobium lancifolium is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in traditional medicine."
