    "intro": "Drymoglossum acrostichoides, commonly known as the acrostichoid fern, is a species of moss belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a complex structure with a central stem and numerous branching shoots, each bearing small, ovate leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in cup-like arrangements called sorus. This moss plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
