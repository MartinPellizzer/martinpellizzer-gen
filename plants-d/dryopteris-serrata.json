    "intro": "Dryopteris serrata, commonly known as the serrated wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It features a robust rhizome system that supports its upright, branched fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive serrated edge that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The plant's spores are released from sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds."
