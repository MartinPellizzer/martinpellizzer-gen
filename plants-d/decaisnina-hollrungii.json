    "intro": "Decaisnina hollrungii, commonly known as the hollrung's lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and woodland settings. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural collections."
