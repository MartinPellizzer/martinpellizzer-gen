    "intro": "Dryopteris weberi, commonly known as Weber's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into lance-shaped pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense clumps. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
