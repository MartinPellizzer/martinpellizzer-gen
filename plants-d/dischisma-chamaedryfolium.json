    "intro": "Dischisma chamaedryfolium, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, mat-forming habit, characterized by its blue to purple flowers and gray-green, woolly foliage. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-adapted to harsh, rocky environments. Its small, daisy-like blooms appear in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dischisma chamaedryfolium is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
