    "intro": "Digitaria chacoensis, commonly known as Chaco grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands, often in regions with seasonal rainfall. Digitaria chacoensis is adapted to withstand drought and is an important component of the local flora in its native range."
