    "intro": "Dodonaea pallida, commonly known as the silverleaf gloryflower, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Dodonaea pallida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
