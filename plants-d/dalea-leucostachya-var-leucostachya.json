    "intro": "Dalea leucostachya var. leucostachya, commonly known as white-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the United States, particularly in the Great Plains. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes, and is adapted to full sun. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
