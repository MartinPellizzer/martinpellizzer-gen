    "intro": "Dendrorkis lineata, commonly known as the lineated tree fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizome system supports its growth, allowing it to reach significant heights over time. Dendrorkis lineata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
