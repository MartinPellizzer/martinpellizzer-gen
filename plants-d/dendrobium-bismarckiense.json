    "intro": "Dendrobium bismarckiense, commonly known as the Bismarck orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Bismarck Archipelago in Papua New Guinea. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered with a layer of brownish bark-like material. Dendrobium bismarckiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
