    "intro": "Dasylirion stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's century plant, is a species of agave native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of long, narrow, blue-green leaves that are covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears numerous white to pale purple flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
