    "intro": "Didissandra longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-stemmed sandalwood, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional craftsmanship and perfumery. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
