    "intro": "Davilanthus hidalgoanus, commonly known as the Hidalgoan beauty, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to arid environments. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces achenes as its fruit type. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
