It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant produces slender, cylindrical fruits that are covered in hooked bristles, aiding in seed dispersal. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
