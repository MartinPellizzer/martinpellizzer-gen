    "intro": "Desmodium heterocarpon subsp. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaf desmodium, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with slender, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by cylindrical, pod-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and wetland habitats. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
