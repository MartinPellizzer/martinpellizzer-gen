    "intro": "Davallia trapezoides, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a unique fern characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a dense, moss-like covering on its rhizomes that helps retain moisture. Its leaves are typically leathery and can grow up to several feet in length, often with a deep green color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive appearance."
