    "intro": "Dendrophthora ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous tree parasite, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host trees. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is native to tropical regions of South America. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and minerals. Despite its parasitic nature, Dendrophthora ambigua plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its forest habitat."
