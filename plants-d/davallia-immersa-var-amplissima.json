    "intro": "Davallia immersa var. amplissima, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded garden beds or as a houseplant."
