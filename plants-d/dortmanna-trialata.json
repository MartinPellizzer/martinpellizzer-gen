    "intro": "Dortmanna trialata, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions, and its leaves are succulent to store water. Dortmanna trialata thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
