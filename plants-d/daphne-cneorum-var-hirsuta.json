    "intro": "Daphne cneorum var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy daphne, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and showy, long-lasting blooms. It is relatively low-maintenance but requires well-drained soil and protection from frost."
