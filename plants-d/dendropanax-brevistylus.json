    "intro": "Dendropanax brevistylus, commonly known as the short-styled arrowhead, is a climbing shrub native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and understorey habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
