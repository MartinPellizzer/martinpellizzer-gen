It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with white lips during the dry season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments with well-draining soil. Dendrobium jacobsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
