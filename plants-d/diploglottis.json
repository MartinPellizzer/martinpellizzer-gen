It typically grows on the branches of host trees, drawing nutrients and water from them. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in pairs along the stems. Its flowers are white or pale green and are clustered in dense inflorescences. The berries it produces are red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds."
