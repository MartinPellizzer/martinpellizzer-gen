It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
