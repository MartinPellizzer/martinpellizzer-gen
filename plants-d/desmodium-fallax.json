    "intro": "Desmodium fallax, commonly known as the small cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to the United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round, edible pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used as a forage crop for livestock. Desmodium fallax is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
