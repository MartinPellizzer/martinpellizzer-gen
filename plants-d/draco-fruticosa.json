    "intro": "Draco fruticosa, commonly known as the dragon's blood tree, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a reddish-brown resin, which has been historically used for medicinal and dye purposes. Its unique morphology includes a thick, woody stem and small, leathery leaves. Draco fruticosa is adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
