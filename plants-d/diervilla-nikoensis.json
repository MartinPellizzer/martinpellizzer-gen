    "intro": "Diervilla nikoensis, commonly known as Niko's hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and small, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, nut-like fruits that are encased in a persistent, woody shell. Diervilla nikoensis is adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy ornamental plant in cooler climates."
