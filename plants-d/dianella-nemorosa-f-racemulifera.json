    "intro": "Dianella nemorosa f. racemulifera, commonly known as the racemose form of the common flax lily, is a variant of the native New Zealand plant Dianella nemorosa. It is a low-growing, evergreen perennial that forms dense clumps of strap-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late winter to early spring. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This form is distinguished by its more elongated inflorescences compared to the typical variety."
