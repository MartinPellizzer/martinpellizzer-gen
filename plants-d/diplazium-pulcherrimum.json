It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and bright yellow spore clusters. The plant features fronds that are typically upright and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive golden hue on the underside. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance. The spores are produced in specialized structures called sorus, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds."
