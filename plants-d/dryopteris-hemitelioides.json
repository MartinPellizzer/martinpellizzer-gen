    "intro": "Dryopteris hemitelioides, commonly known as the Hemitelioid Fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or cascading in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
