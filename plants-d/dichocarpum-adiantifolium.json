It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and often covered in a silvery bloom. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in racemate inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
