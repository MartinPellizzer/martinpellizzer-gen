    "intro": "Drosera chrysochila, commonly known as the golden mistletoe sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, sticky hair-like structures that secrete a sweet mucilage to trap insects. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a cluster, and its leaves are typically covered in glandular trichomes. It thrives in wet, boggy environments and is often found in heathlands. Drosera chrysochila is a low-growing plant that relies on insect prey for nutrients due to the nutrient-poor soils it inhabits."
