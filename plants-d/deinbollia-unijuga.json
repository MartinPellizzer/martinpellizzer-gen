    "intro": "Deinbollia unijuga, commonly known as the single-leaf bower vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, single leaf that is often deeply lobed and resembles a heart shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fleshy, red berries. Its foliage is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Deinbollia unijuga thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
