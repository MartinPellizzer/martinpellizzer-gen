    "intro": "Dryopsila maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found growing in dunes or on rocky shores. Its leaves are succulent, allowing it to store water and withstand arid conditions. Dryopsila maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
