    "intro": "Dryopteris goedenii, commonly known as the Goeden's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
