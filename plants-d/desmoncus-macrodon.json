It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with long, segmented stems that produce fiddleheads and mature fronds. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, cup-like structure at the base of each pinna. Desmoncus macrodon thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage."
