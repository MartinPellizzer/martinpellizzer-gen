    "intro": "Dichapetalum glandulosum var. fulvialabastrum, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed dichapetalum, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its yellowish-green stems, which are covered in glandular hairs, giving it a unique texture and appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy surface, contributing to its distinctive botanical profile. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
