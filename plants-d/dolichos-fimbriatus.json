    "intro": "Dolichos fimbriatus, commonly known as the hairy runner bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, hairy stems that twine around supports, and its leaves are trifoliate with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, fimbriated pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth. Dolichos fimbriatus is valued both for its ornamental appeal and as a source of nutritious beans."
