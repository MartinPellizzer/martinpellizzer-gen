    "intro": "Dryopteris emeiensis, commonly known as Emei Mountain Shield Fern, is a species of shield fern native to China. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush green cover throughout the year."
