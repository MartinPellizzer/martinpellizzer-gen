    "intro": "Diplacus speciosus, commonly known as the hummingbird flower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, pink to red flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators, especially hummingbirds. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as woodlands and meadows, preferring well-drained soil. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy as well. Diplacus speciosus blooms from late spring to early summer, producing clusters of flowers that are both ornamental and ecologically significant."
