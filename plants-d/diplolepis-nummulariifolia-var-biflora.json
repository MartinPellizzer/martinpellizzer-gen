    "intro": "Diplolepis nummulariifolia var. biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in pairs, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and relatively rare species within the Ranunculaceae family."
