    "intro": "Dioscorea parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered yam, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend supports. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers, typically arranged in clusters, and its tuberous roots are the primary economically important part. Dioscorea parviflora is often cultivated for its edible tubers, which are rich in starch and used in various traditional cuisines. However, the plant is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to fully understand its botanical and therapeutic applications."
