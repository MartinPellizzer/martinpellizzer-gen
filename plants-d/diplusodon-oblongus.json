    "intro": "Diplusodon oblongus, commonly known as the broadleaf thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its robust, upright stems and large, woolly leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces showy, purple or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Diplusodon oblongus is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun."
