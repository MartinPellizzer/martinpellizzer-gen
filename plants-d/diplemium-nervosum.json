    "intro": "Diplemium nervosum, commonly known as the narrow-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous narrow segments. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical collections."
