    "intro": "Dryopteris nuda, commonly known as the naked fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically unbranched and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the ground. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
