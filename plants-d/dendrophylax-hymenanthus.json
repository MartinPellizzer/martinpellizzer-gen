    "intro": "Dendrophylax hymenanthus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender roots that anchor it to its host and absorb moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive, delicate appearance. Due to its habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species."
