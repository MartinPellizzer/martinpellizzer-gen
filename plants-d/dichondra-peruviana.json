    "intro": "Dichondra peruviana, commonly known as silverleaf dichondra, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to South America. It features small, opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by round, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ground cover in rocky or arid landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and ability to tolerate drought conditions."
