    "intro": "Dryopteris chrysodioides, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are adorned with golden-brown sori on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fiddleheads emerging in the spring and maturing over the growing season."
