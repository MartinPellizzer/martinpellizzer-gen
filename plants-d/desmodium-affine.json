    "intro": "Desmodium affine, commonly known as hairy beggar's ticks, is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is native to the Americas and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage or as a cover crop. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil fertility."
