    "intro": "Dryopteris macilenta, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often growing in woodlands or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The slender wood fern is notable for its graceful appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
