    "intro": "Diplochlamys griffithianus, commonly known as the Griffith's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, feathery, compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, particularly India and Sri Lanka, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
