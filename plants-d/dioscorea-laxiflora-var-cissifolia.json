    "intro": "Dioscorea laxiflora var. cissifolia, commonly known as the creeping yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its long, slender stems that often trail along the ground. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers, followed by tuberous roots that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, while its stems are typically hairy as well. This variant is distinguished by its more spreading growth habit compared to other varieties of Dioscorea."
