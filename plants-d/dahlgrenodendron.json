    "intro": "Dahlgrenodendron, commonly known as the ghost tree, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of New Guinea. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble those of its namesake, the ghost plant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dahlgrenodendron is considered a vulnerable species."
