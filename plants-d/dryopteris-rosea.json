    "intro": "Dryopteris rosea, commonly known as the rose fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, upright fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris rosea thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate climates."
