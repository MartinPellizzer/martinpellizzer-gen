    "intro": "Dryopteris septempedalis, commonly known as the seven-foot fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach lengths of up to seven feet, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that spread horizontally through the soil. Its fronds are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, with a deep green color that remains throughout the year. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
