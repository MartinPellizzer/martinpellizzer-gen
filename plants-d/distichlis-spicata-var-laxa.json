    "intro": "Distichlis spicata var. laxa, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its low, spreading growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in saline and coastal environments, making it an important component of dune ecosystems. Due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil, it is often used in restoration projects along shorelines."
