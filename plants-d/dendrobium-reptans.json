    "intro": "Dendrobium reptans, commonly known as the creeping dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its terrestrial growth habit, with a rhizomatous stem that allows it to spread along the forest floor. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid environment. Dendrobium reptans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
