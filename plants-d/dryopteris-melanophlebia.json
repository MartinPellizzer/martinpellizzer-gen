    "intro": "Dryopteris melanophlebia, commonly known as the black-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with prominent, blackish veins that stand out against the foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
