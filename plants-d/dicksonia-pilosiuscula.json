    "intro": "Dicksonia pilosiuscula, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a dense, hairy layer of old fronds. The plant produces large, pale to dark green, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and coastal areas."
