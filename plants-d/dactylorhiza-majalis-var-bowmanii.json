    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis var. bowmanii, commonly known as the Bowman's marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in northern Europe. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome and produces erect, slender stems that bear a single spike of white to pale purple flowers. The leaves are linear and arranged in two rows, while the flowers have three sepals and three petals, with the latter being showy and often hooded. This orchid thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is typically found in bogs, marshes, and fen environments. It is a protected species in several countries due to its rarity and ecological significance."
