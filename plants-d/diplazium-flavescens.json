    "intro": "Diplazium flavescens, commonly known as the yellow fringed fern, is a perennial fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bright yellow fronds with fringed margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
