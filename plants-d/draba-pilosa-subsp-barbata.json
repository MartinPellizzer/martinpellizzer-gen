    "intro": "Draba pilosa subsp. barbata, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically features dense, hairy foliage and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it is adapted to harsh climatic conditions. Its subspecies barbata is distinguished by its longer, more barbed hairs on the leaves and stems. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil in its habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
