    "intro": "Dryopteris atrata f. cycadina, commonly known as the cycad-like shield fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that resemble those of cycads. It is a hybrid form that exhibits traits of both Dryopteris atrata and cycad-like foliage, making it a fascinating subject in botanical studies. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its fronds are dark green, with a rough texture and a compact, shield-like appearance. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in shady gardens and greenhouses."
