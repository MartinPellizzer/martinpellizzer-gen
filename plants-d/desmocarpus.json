    "intro": "Desmocarpus, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. These plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, or white. The fruit of Desmocarpus is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature that aids in its dispersal. They are native to various regions in Australia and are often found in rocky or coastal habitats. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value."
