    "intro": "Drymaria tepicana, commonly known as the Mexican sand verbena, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in sandy and well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss in dry conditions. Drymaria tepicana is adapted to hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats."
