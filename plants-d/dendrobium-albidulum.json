    "intro": "Dendrobium albidulum, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender stems that can reach several feet in length, often adorned with clusters of small, white flowers. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, arranged along the stem. Dendrobium albidulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
