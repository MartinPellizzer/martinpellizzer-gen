    "intro": "Dischidia depressa, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a vining epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its aerial roots allow it to attach to trees and other structures, making it well adapted to humid, shaded environments. Dischidia depressa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
