    "intro": "Delissea acuminata f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved delissea, is a rare and intriguing plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
