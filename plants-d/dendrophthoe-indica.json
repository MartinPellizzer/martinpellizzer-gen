    "intro": "Dendrophthoe indica, commonly known as the Indian ghost flower, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as mango and neem, using specialized roots to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are simple and opposite, often resembling those of its host plant. Dendrophthoe indica is native to South and Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
