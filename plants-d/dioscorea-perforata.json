    "intro": "Dioscorea perforata, commonly known as the African yam bean, is a climbing vine belonging to the family Dioscoreaceae. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive tuberous roots. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its tubers are often used as a food source in some regions, though they contain toxic compounds that require careful processing. The botanical features of D. perforata make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
