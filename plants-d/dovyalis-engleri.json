    "intro": "Dovyalis engleri, commonly known as the Natal sour plum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green fruits that are highly acidic. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a rough texture, and it produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of white and pink. The fruit is often used in traditional medicine and for making jams and beverages due to its tart flavor."
