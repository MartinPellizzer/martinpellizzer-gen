    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 gomerica, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octopleura. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that often display a striking golden hue on their underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions."
