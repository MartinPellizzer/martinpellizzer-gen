    "intro": "Dryopteris callopsis, commonly known as the broad-footed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, broad, and often rounded shape at the base. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its fronds."
