    "intro": "Dicliptera betschuanica, commonly known as the African grass or Betshuana grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Dicliptera betschuanica is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils. Its fibrous roots contribute to soil stabilization, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat."
