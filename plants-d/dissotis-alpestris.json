It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, tufted foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an important species in ecological studies of high-altitude ecosystems."
