The plant has slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrorkis rosea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
