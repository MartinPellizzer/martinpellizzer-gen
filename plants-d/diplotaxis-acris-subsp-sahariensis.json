    "intro": "Diplotaxis acris subsp. sahariensis, commonly known as the Saharan wallflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
