    "intro": "Dryopteris clintoniana var. slossoniae, commonly known as the Clintonia fern, is a variant of the Clintonia fern native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that emerge from a rhizomatous root system. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland environments, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, arching growth habit that contributes to its ornamental appeal. The species is noted for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
