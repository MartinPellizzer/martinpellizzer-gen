    "intro": "Dracaena duchneri, commonly known as the red-edged dracaena, is a species of flowering plant in the Asparagaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves with distinctive red margins. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by bright blue or purple berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena duchneri is a popular ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
