    "intro": "Dactylorchis maurusia, commonly known as the Mauretanian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, often hairy growth habit. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow to brownish flowers with a distinct lip, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
