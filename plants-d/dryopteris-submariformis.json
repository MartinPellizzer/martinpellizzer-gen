    "intro": "Dryopteris submariformis, commonly known as the submarine fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a bluish-green hue. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing along stream banks or in rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
