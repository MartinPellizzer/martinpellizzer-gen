    "intro": "Diphryllum cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf fern, is a unique plant with distinctive botanical features. It is a member of the Diphylleaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Diphryllum cordatum is native to tropical regions of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
