    "intro": "Dalea eriophylla var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow to reddish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
