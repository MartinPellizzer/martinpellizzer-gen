    "intro": "Dimacria reflexa, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Dimacria reflexa thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
