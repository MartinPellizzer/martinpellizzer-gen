    "intro": "Dicoma spinosa, commonly known as the spiny dandelion, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and serrated leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and rocky habitats. Dicoma spinosa is adapted to arid conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in drought-prone environments."
