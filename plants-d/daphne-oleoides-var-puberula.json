It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and as a specimen plant."
