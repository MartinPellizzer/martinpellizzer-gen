    "intro": "Didymocheton funkii, commonly known as the Funk's ghost tree, is a rare and unique species native to the rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, tree-like structure with smooth, greyish-brown bark and a distinctive, umbrella-shaped canopy. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
