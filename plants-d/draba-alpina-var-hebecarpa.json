    "intro": "Draba alpina var. hebecarpa, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it forms dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and flowering stems that bear clusters of four-petaled flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive harsh winter conditions due to its compact growth habit and winter-hardy seeds. This variety is often found in mountainous areas of Europe, Asia, and North America."
