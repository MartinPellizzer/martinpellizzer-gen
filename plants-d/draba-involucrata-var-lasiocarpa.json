    "intro": "Draba involucrata var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its often arid or rocky habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variety is adapted to harsh alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
