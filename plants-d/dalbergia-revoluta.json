    "intro": "Dalbergia revoluta, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils with adequate sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and the demand for its wood, it is also considered a species of concern in some regions."
