    "intro": "Discurea sophia, commonly known as the European snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its tuberous roots and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, yellowish-green fruits that contain toxic seeds. Due to its medicinal properties and potential toxicity, it is often cultivated with caution."
