    "intro": "Derris brevipes var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-seeded derris, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, spiny pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. The rough texture of its bark and seeds gives it its scientific variety name, *coriacea*, meaning \"rough\" in Latin."
