    "intro": "Dracula mantissa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has small, fleshy roots that help it absorb moisture from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Dracula mantissa is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
