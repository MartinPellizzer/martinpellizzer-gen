It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and rockeries."
