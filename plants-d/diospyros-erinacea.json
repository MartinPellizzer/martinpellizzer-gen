    "intro": "Diospyros erinacea, commonly known as the hairy persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by edible, orange to red berries. Its fruits are notable for their high nutritional value and are often consumed raw or cooked. Diospyros erinacea is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
