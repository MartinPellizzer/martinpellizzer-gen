    "intro": "Dorstenia walleri var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf star vine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that are usually yellow or greenish in color. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. This variant is smaller than the typical Dorstenia walleri, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its compact size and ornamental appeal."
