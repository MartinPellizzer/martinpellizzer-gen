It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant features areolate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
