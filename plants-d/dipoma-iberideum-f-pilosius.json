    "intro": "Dipoma iberideum f. pilosius, commonly known as the hairy leaf form of the Iberian dipoma, is a rare and unique botanical variant native to the Iberian Peninsula. This fern-like plant exhibits a distinct foliage structure characterized by its densely hairy, soft-textured leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. The plant's morphology includes elongated, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest for conservationists and botanists alike."
