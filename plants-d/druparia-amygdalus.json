It produces small, oval fruits called drupes, which contain a single seed surrounded by a hard shell. The tree is characterized by its compound leaves and fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. Almond trees are cultivated for their edible seeds, which are used in food and cosmetics. The plant has a shallow root system and thrives in well-drained soils with full sunlight."
