It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
