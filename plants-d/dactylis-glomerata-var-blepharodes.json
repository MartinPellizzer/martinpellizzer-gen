    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. blepharodes, commonly known as the tufted grass or blepharodes oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
