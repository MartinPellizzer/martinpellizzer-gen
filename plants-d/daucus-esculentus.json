    "intro": "Daucus esculentus, commonly known as the cow parsnip, is a biennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves and clusters of small white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces a thick, hollow stem that can grow up to 2 meters tall, and its roots are edible when cooked. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and forest edges. The plant contains compounds that can cause skin irritation, so it should be handled with care."
