    "intro": "Desmodium gyroides, commonly known as the hairy desmodium, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
