    "intro": "Dendrobium erythroxanthum, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of red and orange, often with yellow markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in both indoor and greenhouse settings."
