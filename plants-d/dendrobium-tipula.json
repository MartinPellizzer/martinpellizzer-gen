    "intro": "Dendrobium tipula, commonly known as the common orchid, is a species of orchid native to various regions of Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant has long, narrow pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a variety of colors including white, yellow, and green. Dendrobium tipula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
