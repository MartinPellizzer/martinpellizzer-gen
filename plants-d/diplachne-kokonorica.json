    "intro": "Diplachne kokonorica, commonly known as the Tibetan grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Diplachne kokonorica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its ecosystem and is of interest for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
