    "intro": "Dendrobenthamia hupehensis, commonly known as the Hupeh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to China. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, pale green to white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments, typically found in mountainous regions with rich, well-draining soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
