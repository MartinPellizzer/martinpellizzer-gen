    "intro": "Draba sakuraii f. linearis, commonly known as the linear draba, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is native to regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
