    "intro": "Dichrotrichum multiflorum, commonly known as the common dichrotrichum, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its flowers are white or pale yellow, appearing in late spring to early summer. Dichrotrichum multiflorum is often overlooked due to its modest appearance but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
