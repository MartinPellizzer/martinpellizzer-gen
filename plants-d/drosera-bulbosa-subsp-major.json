    "intro": "Drosera bulbosa subsp. major, commonly known as the giant sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems with clusters of small, white flowers. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swamps. Its subspecies status highlights its distinct size and growth habits compared to other Drosera species."
