    "intro": "Dortmanna collina, commonly known as the coastal sandplant, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant has small, linear leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are pale blue or white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Dortmanna collina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal sands and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
