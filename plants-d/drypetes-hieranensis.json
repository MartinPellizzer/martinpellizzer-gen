    "intro": "Drypetes hieranensis, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has alternate, simple, and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in greenish-yellow cyathia, and it produces non-toxic, orange-red fruits that are edible for some bird species. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
