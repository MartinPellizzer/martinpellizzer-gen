    "intro": "Dendranthema pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific fleabane, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its yellow to orange flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dendranthema pacificum is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
