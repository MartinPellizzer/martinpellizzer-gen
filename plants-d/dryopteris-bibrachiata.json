    "intro": "Dryopteris bibrachiata, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a striking fern species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters, making it one of the tallest ferns in its habitat. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-like shape that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time."
