    "intro": "Dorycnium fruticosum, commonly known as goat's beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, creeping rhizome and is characterized by its fern-like, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes during the summer months, which are followed by long, slender pods containing small, flat seeds. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Dorycnium fruticosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
