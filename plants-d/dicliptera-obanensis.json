    "intro": "Dicliptera obanensis, commonly known as the Oban grass, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Scotland. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in peat bogs and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
