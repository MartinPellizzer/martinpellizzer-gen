    "intro": "Delphinium shawurense, commonly known as the Shawuren larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes at the top of the stems. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Delphinium shawurense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that can support its specific growing conditions."
