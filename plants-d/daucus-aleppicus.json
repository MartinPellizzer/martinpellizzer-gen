    "intro": "Daucus aleppicus, commonly known as the Aleppo carrot, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters. Its roots are typically small and not as commercially valuable as those of the common carrot. Daucus aleppicus is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
