    "intro": "Dryopteris melanosticta var. bullata, commonly known as the bullate wood fern, is a variant of the black-stained wood fern. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a tall, slender rhizome with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lanceolate, bipinnate leaves. Its fronds are characterized by a distinctive, warty texture and a dark, almost blackish hue on the underside. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
