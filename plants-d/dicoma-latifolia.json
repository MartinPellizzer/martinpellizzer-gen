    "intro": "Dicoma latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf dicoma, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are broad and often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss. Dicoma latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, daisy-like blooms."
