    "intro": "Doryopteris itatiaiensis, commonly known as the Itatiaia fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
