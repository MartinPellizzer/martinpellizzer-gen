    "intro": "Davallia hirta, commonly known as the hairy Davallia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky or forested substrates. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to form dense, low-growing colonies. The spores are produced in small, round sori that are located on the underside of the fronds."
