    "intro": "Dendrobium ciliferum, commonly known as the golden torch orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of showy, yellow-orange flowers with red markings, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Dendrobium ciliferum thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
