    "intro": "Doliocarpus grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered doliocarpus, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are globose, fleshy berries that mature to a reddish color, often attracting birds and small mammals. Doliocarpus grandiflorus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and floral display."
