    "intro": "Deschampsia, commonly known as hair grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It consists of approximately 100 species, most of which are native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants are typically perennial and form dense, low-growing clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. They are often found in moist or wet environments such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. Deschampsia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
