    "intro": "Didymoplexis cornuta var. maliauensis, commonly known as the Maliauensis spurred orchid, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and the presence of spurred structures on its flowers, which are typical of the Orchidaceae family. The plant produces pendulous, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive red or orange lip, which is often adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
