    "intro": "Dryopteris penangiana, commonly known as the Penang Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of moss, which helps in water retention. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, elegant appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant."
