    "intro": "Dryas octopetala subsp. incisa, commonly known as the serrated mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are typically lobed and serrated, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Due to its cold tolerance and unique morphology, it is an important species in alpine ecosystems."
