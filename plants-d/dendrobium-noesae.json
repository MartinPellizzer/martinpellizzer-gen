    "intro": "Dendrobium noesae, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant features elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically yellow or golden in color, with a distinctive spurred lip. Dendrobium noesae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its beauty in gardens and greenhouses."
