    "intro": "Didissandra minor, commonly known as the lesser didissandra, is a rare and delicate plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and pale green, fleshy stems that help it retain moisture in its swampy habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by berry-like fruits that are edible for certain bird species. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its habitat from degradation and ensure its survival in the wild."
