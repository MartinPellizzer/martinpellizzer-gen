    "intro": "Delpya capitata, commonly known as the floating heart, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of oval, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Delpya capitata is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands, where it can form dense mats on the water. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
