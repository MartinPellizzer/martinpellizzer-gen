    "intro": "Digitaria ischaemum var. lasiophylla, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture on the underside. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its fibrous root system makes it a competitive weed in agricultural settings."
