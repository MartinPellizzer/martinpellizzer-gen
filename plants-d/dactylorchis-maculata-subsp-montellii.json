    "intro": "Dactylorchis maculata subsp. montellii, commonly known as the spotted marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features a slender, erect stem with several oval-shaped leaves, and it produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive purple or brown markings. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized pollination mechanisms. This subspecies is often found in association with other wetland flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
