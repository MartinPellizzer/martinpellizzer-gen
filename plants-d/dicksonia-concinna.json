    "intro": "Dicksonia concinna, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a distinctive crown of spirally arranged leaves that give it a graceful appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The fronds are dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in structure and function."
