    "intro": "Daucus littoralis var. longiradiatus, commonly known as the coastal carrot, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, exhibiting a robust root system adapted to saline and wind-swept environments. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces umbels of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are small, ovoid, and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize coastal areas. This variant is distinguished by its elongated, radiating rays in the flower heads, giving it a distinctive appearance."
