    "intro": "Draba verna var. lanceolata, commonly known as the early whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of 5\u201320 cm and features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, usually between March and May. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its elongated leaf shape compared to the typical form of Draba verna."
