    "intro": "Dryopteris bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
