    "intro": "Dipterocarpus hirtus, commonly known as the hairy dipterocarp, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its large, often buttressed roots and thick, flaky bark. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and its fruits are woody capsules containing seeds. It plays an important ecological role in rainforests, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to its hard, durable wood, it is also valued for timber, though its populations are threatened by deforestation."
