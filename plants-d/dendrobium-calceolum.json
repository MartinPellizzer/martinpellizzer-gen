    "intro": "Dendrobium calceolum, commonly known as the stone orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive waxy texture. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapting to its habitat in rocky or shaded environments. Dendrobium calceolum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique appearance."
