    "intro": "Desmodium albiflorum f. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered desmodium, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to various regions in Africa and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. It has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in ecological restoration projects."
