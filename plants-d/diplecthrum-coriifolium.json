    "intro": "Diplecthrum coriifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, smooth, leathery leaves that are typically broad and heart-shaped. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-producing cones that develop on the undersides of the leaves. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
