    "intro": "Dendrobenthamia angustata var. wuyishanensis, commonly known as the Wuyishan orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Wuyi Mountains in China. It is characterized by its slender, terete pseudobulbs and linear, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the spring season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
