    "intro": "Davallia schimperi, commonly known as the silver-veined holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive silvery vein pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced by new growth."
