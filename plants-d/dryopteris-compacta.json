    "intro": "Dryopteris compacta, commonly known as the dense shield fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It features a rosette-like arrangement of dark green, leathery fronds that remain upright throughout the year. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in clusters called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its dense growth habit makes it an excellent choice for ground cover in shaded garden settings."
