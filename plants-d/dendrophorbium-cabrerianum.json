    "intro": "Dendrophorbium cabrerianum, commonly known as the Cabreria tree, is a unique member of the Rutaceae family, native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and a distinctive, gnarled trunk that often forms a thick, bushy crown. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a leathery texture with a slightly aromatic scent. This plant is well adapted to the arid and rocky environments of its native habitat, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
