    "intro": "Digitaria marianensis, commonly known as coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, coastal environments and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with a rough texture and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and stabilize soil in vulnerable areas."
