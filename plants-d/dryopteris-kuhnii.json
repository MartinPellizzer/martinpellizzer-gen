    "intro": "Dryopteris kuhnii, commonly known as the Kuhn's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces spore-bearing fiddleheads in the spring, which are covered in a brown, hairy layer called the indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific conditions to flourish."
