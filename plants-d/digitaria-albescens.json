    "intro": "Digitaria albescens, commonly known as silverhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, silver-white leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Digitaria albescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
