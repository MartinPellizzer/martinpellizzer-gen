It is characterized by its fine, silver-haired leaves and slender, branched inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in warm, dry conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects."
