    "intro": "Daphne polyantha, commonly known as the Chinese daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features dense, aromatic foliage with a smooth, dark green surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple during late winter to early spring. Its flowers are followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Daphne polyantha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and winter blooming habit."
