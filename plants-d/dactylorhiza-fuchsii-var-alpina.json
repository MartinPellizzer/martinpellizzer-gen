    "intro": "Dactylorhiza fuchsii var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor habitats such as bogs and wet meadows. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. The species is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
