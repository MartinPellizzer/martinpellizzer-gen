    "intro": "Dryopteris subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a perennial fern native to North America. It is characterized by its sturdy, leathery fronds that are covered in a fine, scaly texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively through underground growth."
