    "intro": "Didymocarpus inflatus, commonly known as the inflated tamarind, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated fruit pods that resemble small balloons, which split open to release seeds. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, and its leaves are simple and alternate. The fruit's unique structure aids in seed dispersal by wind, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils."
