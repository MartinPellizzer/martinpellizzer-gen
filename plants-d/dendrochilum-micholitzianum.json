    "intro": "Dendrochilum micholitzianum, commonly known as the Micholitz's tree orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows on tree branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with red or purple markings, attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in its natural range."
