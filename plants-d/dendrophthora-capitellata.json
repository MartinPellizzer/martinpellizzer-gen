    "intro": "Dendrophthora capitellata, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives on the branches of specific host trees. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Its leaves are typically small, elliptical, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrophthora capitellata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in humid, shaded environments."
