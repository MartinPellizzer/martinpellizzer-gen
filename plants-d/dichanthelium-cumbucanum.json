    "intro": "Dichanthelium cumbucanum, commonly known as the Cumbucanum grass, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly found in Brazil. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
