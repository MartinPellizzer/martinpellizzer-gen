    "intro": "Dryopteris barbigera var. falconeri, commonly known as the Falconeri wood fern, is a variant of the broad-ferns, characterized by its distinctive fronds and habitat preferences. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Ecuador, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features large, bipinnate fronds with a unique, toothed margin that gives it a rugged appearance. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. This fern is often found in cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
