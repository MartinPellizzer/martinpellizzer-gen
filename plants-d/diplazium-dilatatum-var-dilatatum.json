It features a robust rhizome system that supports its growth and propagation. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with lanceolate to ovate leaflets, often with a glossy green appearance. Its fronds are typically upright, and it produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of the leaves. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
