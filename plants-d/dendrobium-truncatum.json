    "intro": "Dendrobium truncatum, commonly known as the short-leaf dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a compact, upright growth habit with short, fleshy stems that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically yellow or green with a distinctive red or purple lip. Dendrobium truncatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique and long-lasting blooms."
