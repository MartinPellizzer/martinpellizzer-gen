    "intro": "Dendrobium bracteatum, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple stems that produce fleshy, pseudobulbs for water storage. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a distinctive lip that is broader than the other petals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Dendrobium bracteatum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
