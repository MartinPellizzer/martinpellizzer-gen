It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of pink or red, five-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.
