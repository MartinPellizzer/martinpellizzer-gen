    "intro": "Dryopteris hypolepioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mountain fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly China and Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Dryopteris hypolepioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
