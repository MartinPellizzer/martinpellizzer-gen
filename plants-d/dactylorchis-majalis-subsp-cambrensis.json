    "intro": "Dactylorchis majalis subsp. cambrensis, commonly known as the Welsh marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the wetlands of Wales. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green or yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its symbiotic relationship with soil microorganisms. It thrives in damp, nutrient-poor habitats such as peat bogs and marshes. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
