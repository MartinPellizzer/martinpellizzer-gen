    "intro": "Dichanthium ischaemum subvar. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the United States. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, and its leaves are narrow with a prominent midrib. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
