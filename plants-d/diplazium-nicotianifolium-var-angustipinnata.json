    "intro": "Diplazium nicotianifolium var. angustipinnata, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound leaves that resemble those of tobacco plants, giving it its species name. The plant thrives in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and often form dense mats, contributing to its ability to colonize waterlogged soils. The fronds are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a distinctive aquatic or semi-aquatic fern."
