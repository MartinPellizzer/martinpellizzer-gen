    "intro": "Dieffenbachia seguine subvar. lingulata, commonly known as the Shiny Dieffenbachia, is a striking tropical houseplant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, waxy, dark green leaves with a distinctive white or light green midrib and serrated edges. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is often adorned with a subtle sheen, giving it a luxurious appearance. It is important to note that the plant is toxic if ingested, so it should be kept away from pets and children."
