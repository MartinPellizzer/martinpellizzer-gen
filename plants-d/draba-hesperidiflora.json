    "intro": "Draba hesperidiflora, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in alpine and subalpine regions. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a low, mat-like growth habit, with basal leaves that are often hairy. Draba hesperidiflora is adapted to cold climates and can survive in high-altitude environments with limited soil nutrients. Its short life cycle and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
