    "intro": "Diplazium neglectum, commonly known as the neglected water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its spores are released into the water, allowing for propagation through aquatic dispersal. The fronds are usually dichotomously divided, contributing to its distinctive appearance in aquatic habitats."
