    "intro": "Dracocephalum nutans var. alpinum, commonly known as alpine blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variant is closely related to other members of the Lamiaceae family, sharing similar aromatic properties and growth habits."
