    "intro": "Dioscorea heterophylla, commonly known as the variable yam, is a member of the Dioscoreaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial vine that can grow up to several meters in length, with alternate, often heart-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its tuberous roots are the primary part used, though they are generally not cultivated for food due to their bitter taste and potential toxicity. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
