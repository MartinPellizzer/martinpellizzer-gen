    "intro": "Draba dolichostyla, commonly known as the long-stemmed whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant typically features a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Draba dolichostyla is adapted to cold, alpine environments and is often found in rocky soils at high elevations. Its flowering period is short, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat."
