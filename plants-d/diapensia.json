    "intro": "Diapensia, commonly known as the rock chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Diapensia has a compact growth habit, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems."
