    "intro": "Delphinium esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's larkspur, is a striking perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the western Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant features palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
