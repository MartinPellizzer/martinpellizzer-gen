    "intro": "Dactylaena, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale, almost translucent flowers. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, relying on specific host plants for support. Its botanical features include a lack of leaves and a highly specialized root system adapted for nutrient absorption. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Dactylaena is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
