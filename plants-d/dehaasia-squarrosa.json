    "intro": "Dehaasia squarrosa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed daisies, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, rough stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates. Dehaasia squarrosa is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
