    "intro": "Dendrochilum rigidifolium, commonly known as the rigid-leafed tree orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody, tree-like growth habit, which sets it apart from most other orchids that are herbaceous. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive coloration, often in shades of yellow and orange. Its leaves are thick and rigid, adapted to withstand the humid and often shaded conditions of its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered an endangered species and is highly valued in botanical conservation efforts."
