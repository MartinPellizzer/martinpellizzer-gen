    "intro": "Dendropemon portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the subtropical forests of Puerto Rico. It typically grows on trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in conservation efforts."
