    "intro": "Dalechampia martiana, commonly known as the Mexican elephant tree, is a tropical shrub native to Central America. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by distinctive, spiny, pear-shaped fruits. Its unique morphology makes it a striking addition to botanical collections and a subject of interest in horticulture. Dalechampia martiana is also valued for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it adaptable to various climates."
