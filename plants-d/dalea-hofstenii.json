    "intro": "Dalea hofstenii, commonly known as the Hofsten's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Dalea hofstenii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for native pollinators."
