    "intro": "Desmostachys planchonianus f. angustisepalus, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant characterized by its elongated, bell-shaped corolla. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is distinguished by its narrow, pointed sepals and pale blue to violet petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its small, clustered inflorescence produces numerous flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
