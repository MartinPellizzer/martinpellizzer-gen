It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are broad and slightly lobed, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Dockrillia sulphurea is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant color and unique appearance."
