    "intro": "Dryopteris subfluvialis, commonly known as the river fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of Asia, North America, and Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal rather than seeds. The river fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in wetland ecosystems."
