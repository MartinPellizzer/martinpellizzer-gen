    "intro": "Diplazium caudatum, commonly known as the spurred brake, is a fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated, and often hairy fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Diplazium caudatum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in forest ecosystems."
