    "intro": "Descurainia preauxiana, commonly known as the desert mustard, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, sunny conditions. Descurainia preauxiana plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations in its native habitat."
