    "intro": "Dryopteris lepida, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for propagation. Dryopteris lepida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
