    "intro": "Dryopteris tavelii, commonly known as the Tavelii wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky or humus-rich soil. The Tavelii wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
