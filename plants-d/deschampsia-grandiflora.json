    "intro": "Deschampsia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more prominent as the plant matures. Deschampsia grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
