    "intro": "Didiscus incisus subsp. grandiceps, commonly known as the giant rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
