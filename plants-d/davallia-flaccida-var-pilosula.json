    "intro": "Davallia flaccida var. pilosula, commonly known as the hairy Davallia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a unique textured appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the forest floor. The varietal form pilosula distinguishes it from the typical Davallia flaccida by its more pronounced hairy covering on the fronds."
