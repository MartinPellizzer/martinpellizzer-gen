    "intro": "Dendrophthoe fulva, commonly known as the golden dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with its yellow, thread-like stems. The plant typically attaches itself to the stems or branches of other plants, such as legumes or shrubs, using specialized structures called haustoria. It is native to various regions in Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can sometimes cause damage to its host plants."
