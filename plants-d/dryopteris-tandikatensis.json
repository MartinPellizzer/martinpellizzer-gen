    "intro": "Dryopteris tandikatensis, commonly known as the Tandikat fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to the forest floor. The Tandikat fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
