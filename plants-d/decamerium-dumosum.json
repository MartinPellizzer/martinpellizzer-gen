    "intro": "Decamerium dumosum, commonly known as the bushy decamerium, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are opposite and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Decamerium dumosum is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can withstand periods of drought."
