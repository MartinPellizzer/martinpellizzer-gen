    "intro": "Diplazium accedens, commonly known as the slender chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fertile leaves."
