    "intro": "Dracophyllum palustre, commonly known as the swamp heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to wetland environments in Australia. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically clustered around the stems, which helps reduce water loss in its moist habitats. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to acidic soils and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a common species in swampy areas. Dracophyllum palustre plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
