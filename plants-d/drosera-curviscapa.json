    "intro": "Drosera curviscapa, commonly known as the curved-horned sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested to provide nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It has small, clustered leaves that form a rosette shape, and its flowers are usually pink or red. Drosera curviscapa is a perennial species that thrives in cool, moist conditions."
