    "intro": "Dipteracanthus grandiflorus var. clandestinus, commonly known as the secret grandiflorus, is a rare flowering plant native to the understory of tropical rainforests. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive, elongated corolla. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and a dense network of veins. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, often forming a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
