    "intro": "Dictyogramme hederifolia, commonly known as the common water fern, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It features feathery, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface, with roots extending into the water for anchorage. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores into the water for propagation. The plant's delicate appearance makes it both an ecological indicator species and a popular choice for ornamental water gardens."
