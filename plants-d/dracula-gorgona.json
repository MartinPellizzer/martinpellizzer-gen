    "intro": "Dracula gorgona, commonly known as the vampire orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, dark purple flowers that resemble the appearance of a bat's wing, earning it its ominous common name. The plant has a short, thick stem and produces small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat. Dracula gorgona is known for its delicate and ephemeral blooms, which appear only briefly during the rainy season. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
