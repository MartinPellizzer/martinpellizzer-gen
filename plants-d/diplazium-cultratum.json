    "intro": "Diplazium cultratum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture and a dark green color. Diplazium cultratum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
