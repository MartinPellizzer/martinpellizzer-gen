    "intro": "Dendrobium mellitum, commonly known as the honey orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its tropical environment. Dendrobium mellitum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
