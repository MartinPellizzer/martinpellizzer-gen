    "intro": "Dicksonia domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a robust root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Dicksonia domingensis is often found in tropical forests, where it thrives in high humidity and moderate temperatures."
