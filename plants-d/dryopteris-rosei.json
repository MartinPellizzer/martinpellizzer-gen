    "intro": "Dryopteris rosei, commonly known as the rose fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while absorbing nutrients. Dryopteris rosei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
