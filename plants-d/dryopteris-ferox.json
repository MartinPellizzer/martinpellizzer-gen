    "intro": "Dryopteris ferox, commonly known as the humped back wood fern, is a robust fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often deeply lobed and have a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Dryopteris ferox is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual impact."
