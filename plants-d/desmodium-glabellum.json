    "intro": "Desmodium glabellum, commonly known as the hairy burr legume, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that enclose its seeds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Desmodium glabellum is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural settings."
