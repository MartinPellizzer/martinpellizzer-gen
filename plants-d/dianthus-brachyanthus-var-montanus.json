    "intro": "Dianthus brachyanthus var. montanus, commonly known as the mountain carnation, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers with frilled petals. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It prefers full sun and is drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat."
