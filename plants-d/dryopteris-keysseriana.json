    "intro": "Dryopteris keysseriana, commonly known as the Keyser's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its upright, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing leaves, known as sporangia, which are clustered in compact structures called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. The fronds are divided into multiple segments, giving the plant a delicate and intricate appearance."
