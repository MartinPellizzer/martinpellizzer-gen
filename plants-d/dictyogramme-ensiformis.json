It is characterized by its long, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the forest floor. Its fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. Dictyogramme ensiformis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
