    "intro": "Dryopteris intermedia f. sparsifrondosa, commonly known as the sparse-foliage wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, delicate fronds. It features a compact, upright growth habit with deeply divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often spaced apart, giving it a sparse appearance. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-bearing sori arranged in lines on the underside. This fern thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in temperate forest regions. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
