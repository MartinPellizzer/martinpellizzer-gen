    "intro": "Diospyros tireliae, commonly known as the Sierra Madre persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family, which includes ebony and persimmon trees, and is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, orange to red fruits that are edible and have a sweet, sometimes astringent flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
