    "intro": "Draba violacea var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-capsied whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features a compact rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in early spring, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless floral bracts, which set it apart from other Draba species."
