It belongs to the Araceae family, which includes plants such as philodendrons and calla lilies. The plant is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and a single, showy inflorescence that resembles a spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
