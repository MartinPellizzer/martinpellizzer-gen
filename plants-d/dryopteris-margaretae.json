    "intro": "Dryopteris margaretae, commonly known as the Margareta's wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a slender, upright growth habit. Native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, it thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in temperate gardens."
