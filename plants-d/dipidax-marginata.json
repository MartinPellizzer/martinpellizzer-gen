    "intro": "Dipidax marginata, commonly known as the marginated dipidax, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves with a margin that is often wavy or toothed. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters, often in shades of pink or purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
