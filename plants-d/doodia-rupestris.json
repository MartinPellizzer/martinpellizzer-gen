    "intro": "Doodia rupestris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to Australia. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and dense, compact growth habit, often forming thick mats on rocky substrates. The fronds are typically dark green, leathery, and have a distinctive, segmented appearance. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
