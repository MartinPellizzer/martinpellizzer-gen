It is characterized by its striking, large, white to pale purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has strap-shaped, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Drimia noctiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique flowering habit."
