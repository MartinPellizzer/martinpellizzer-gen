    "intro": "Dryopteris rubrobrunnea, commonly known as the red-bronze wood fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often display a reddish-brown hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help stabilize soil. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
