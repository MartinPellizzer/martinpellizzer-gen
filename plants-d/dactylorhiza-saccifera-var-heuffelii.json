    "intro": "Dactylorhiza saccifera var. heuffelii, commonly known as the Heuffel's bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and marshes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. This variety is distinguished by its unique floral structure and is considered a rare and protected species in many parts of its range."
