    "intro": "Dedea oreophila, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. The plant features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its unique habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Dedea oreophila is considered endangered in its natural range."
