    "intro": "Draba pingwuensis, commonly known as the Pingwu sandwort, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China, where it thrives in alpine environments. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, basal leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, adapting to the harsh climatic conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Draba pingwuensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its arid and rocky environment."
