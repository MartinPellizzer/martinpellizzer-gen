It features a sympodial growth habit with a pseudobulb that supports its foliage and flowers. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy texture. Dendrobium gouldii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial shade for optimal growth."
