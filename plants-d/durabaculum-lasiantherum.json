    "intro": "Durabaculum lasiantherum, commonly known as the hardy rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and adaptability to harsh environments make it a notable species in its ecological niche. Durabaculum lasiantherum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
