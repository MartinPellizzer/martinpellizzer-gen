    "intro": "Drakensteinia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves and striking, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Drakensteinia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
