    "intro": "Dryopteris cornuta, commonly known as the hederaceae or the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris cornuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
