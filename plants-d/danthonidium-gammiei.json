    "intro": "Danthonidium gammiei, commonly known as the New Zealand hairgrass, is a member of the Poaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is a low-growing, mat-forming grass that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to form dense, turfy mats, which help in soil stabilization. Danthonidium gammiei is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to colonize disturbed sites."
