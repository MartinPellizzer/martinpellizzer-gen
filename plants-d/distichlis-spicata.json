    "intro": "Distichlis spicata, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to saline and alkaline soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland and marsh environments, often serving as a stabilizing plant in coastal dunes. Distichlis spicata is valued for its ecological role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
