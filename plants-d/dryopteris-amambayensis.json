    "intro": "Dryopteris amambayensis, commonly known as the Amambay fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the subtropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lobes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
