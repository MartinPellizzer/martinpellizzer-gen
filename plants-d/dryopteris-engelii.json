    "intro": "Dryopteris engelii, commonly known as Engel's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are divided into multiple pinnae, which are lance-shaped and have a serrated margin. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
