    "intro": "Dracaena cernua, commonly known as the weeping dracaena, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping leaves that give it a distinctive cascading appearance. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in drier conditions. Its leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries. Dracaena cernua is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
