    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 alutiiqorum, commonly known as the Alutiiq orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the coastal regions of Alaska and Canada. It is a terrestrial orchid with a rhizomatous growth habit and typically produces tall, erect flowering stems. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal heath and tundra habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
