    "intro": "Dupatya pilifera, commonly known as the silky hair vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its fibrous roots and flexible stems make it suitable for use in ornamental gardening and erosion control. Dupatya pilifera thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
