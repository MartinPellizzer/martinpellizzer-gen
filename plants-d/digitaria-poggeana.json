    "intro": "Digitaria poggeana, commonly known as the African grass or slender digitaria, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is often used as a forage plant for livestock due to its high nutritional value and adaptability. Digitaria poggeana is also valued in ecological restoration projects because of its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
