    "intro": "Dendragrostis anelytra, commonly known as the slender false sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and pink or white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are often succulent, helping it retain moisture in nutrient-poor conditions. Dendragrostis anelytra plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is an indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems."
