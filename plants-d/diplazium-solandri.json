    "intro": "Diplazium solandri, commonly known as the common hederon, is a fern native to various regions of Asia, including India, China, and Japan. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are pinnate and often have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Diplazium solandri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture."
