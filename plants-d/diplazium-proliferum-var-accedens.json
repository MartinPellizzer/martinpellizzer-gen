    "intro": "Diplazium proliferum var. accedens, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a low-growing fern species native to Southeast Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively along the forest floor. The plant has lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically bright green and covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical woodlands. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation."
