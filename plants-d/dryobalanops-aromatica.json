    "intro": "Dryobalanops aromatica, commonly known as the aromatic ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the island of Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, dark brown bark and thick, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, aromatic fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within lowland and hill dipterocarp forests. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered an endangered species."
