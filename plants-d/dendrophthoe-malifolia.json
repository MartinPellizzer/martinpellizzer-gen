    "intro": "Dendrophthoe malifolia, commonly known as the Indian ghost flower, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the branches of trees like Ficus species. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to absorb water and nutrients. Despite its parasitic nature, Dendrophthoe malifolia plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
