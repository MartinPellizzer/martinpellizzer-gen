    "intro": "Davalliopsis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of epiphytic and lithophytic ferns belonging to the family Velloziaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, delicate fronds that often form dense clusters on rocks or tree trunks. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with high humidity and well-drained substrates. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, which helps them retain moisture in their often arid habitats. Davalliopsis species are prized in horticulture for their unique appearance and ability to thrive in specialized growing conditions."
