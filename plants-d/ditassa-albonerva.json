    "intro": "Ditassa albonerva, commonly known as the white-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of host trees in tropical and subtropical regions. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant's leaves are typically small, oval-shaped, and have a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often displaying white or pale yellow petals. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in seed dispersal by animals."
