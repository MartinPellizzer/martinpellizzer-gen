    "intro": "Dasylirion pliabile, commonly known as the narrowleaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, stiff, grass-like leaves that are blue-green in color and have a waxy coating. The plant produces striking clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fibers for basket weaving."
