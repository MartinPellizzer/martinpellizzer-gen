    "intro": "Drosera madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of pink or red. Drosera madagascariensis is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
