It features small, rounded leaves that are densely packed, giving it a moss-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
