It belongs to the family Dicranaceae and is characterized by its delicate, filamentous structure and pale green to brownish coloration. The plant typically grows on soil, rock, or decaying wood, and is often found in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature.
