    "intro": "Diplazium setosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Diplazium setosum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
