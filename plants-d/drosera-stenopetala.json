    "intro": "Drosera stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of sticky-hair covered leaves that trap insects, which are then digested by the plant's enzymes. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, acidic environments and requires careful watering to prevent root rot. Drosera stenopetala is a popular choice for carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and ease of cultivation."
