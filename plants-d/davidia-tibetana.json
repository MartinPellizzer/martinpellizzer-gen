    "intro": "Davidia tibetana, commonly known as the Tibet dove tree, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its striking white, lantern-like flowers that appear in early spring, often accompanied by drooping, feathery bracts. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, and it is known for its slow growth and longevity. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
