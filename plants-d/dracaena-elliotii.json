It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and long, narrow, dark green leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow streaks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.

Dracaena elliotii is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
