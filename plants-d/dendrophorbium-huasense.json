It is characterized by its unusual morphology, featuring a woody stem with small, clustered leaves. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship with certain fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Its flowers are small and clustered, often producing nectar to attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species."
