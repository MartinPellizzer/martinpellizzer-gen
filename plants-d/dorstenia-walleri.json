    "intro": "Dorstenia walleri, commonly known as the \"Devil's Tongue,\" is a unique member of the Moraceae family, native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, fleshy, tongue-shaped leaves that curl inward when touched, a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that bloom in the late afternoon. Its stems are often swollen and can store water, adapting it to arid environments. Dorstenia walleri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and intriguing physical characteristics."
