    "intro": "Dipsacus minor, commonly known as lesser teasel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, with rough, spiny stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive, bristly seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in dry meadows. Dipsacus minor is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
