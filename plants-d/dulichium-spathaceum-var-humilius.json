    "intro": "Dulichium spathaceum var. humilius, commonly known as the slender marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale green to brown flowers. This variety is notable for its adaptability to waterlogged conditions and its role in stabilizing wetland soils."
