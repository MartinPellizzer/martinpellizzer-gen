It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single inflorescence with numerous small flowers. Dendrobium findlayanum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
