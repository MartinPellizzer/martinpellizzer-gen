It features compound leaves with elliptical to ovate leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes. The plant is characterized by its woody, branched stems and is often found in dry, sandy soils. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod, and the plant is known for its ornamental value and traditional uses. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some areas."
