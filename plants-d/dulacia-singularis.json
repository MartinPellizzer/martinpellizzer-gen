    "intro": "Dulacia singularis, commonly known as the rare moonflower of the Andes, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a subtle fragrance. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in its arid environment. Its unique blooming pattern occurs only during the night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dulacia singularis is considered a vulnerable species."
