    "intro": "Dichanthelium koolauense, commonly known as Koolauense grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two bracts, which are distinctive features of the genus Dichanthelium. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
