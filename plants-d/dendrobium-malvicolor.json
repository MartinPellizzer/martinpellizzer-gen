    "intro": "Dendrobium malvicolor, commonly known as the purple-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white or pale green hair. Its flowers are typically pale purple or white with intricate veining, and they bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Dendrobium malvicolor is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
