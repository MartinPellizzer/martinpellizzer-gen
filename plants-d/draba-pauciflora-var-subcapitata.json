    "intro": "Draba pauciflora var. subcapitata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved whitlow grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a small annual herb characterized by its basal rosette of linear, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, short flowering stem that bears a dense cluster of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
