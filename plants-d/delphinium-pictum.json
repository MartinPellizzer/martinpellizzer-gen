    "intro": "Delphinium pictum, commonly known as the painted larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers with distinctive white or pale markings. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological importance in its native environment."
