    "intro": "Dendrophorbium vanillodorum, commonly known as the vanilla orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This plant is notable for its fragrant, vanilla-scented flowers, which are essential in the production of vanilla extract. It typically grows as an epiphytic plant, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom sequentially throughout the year. Its unique botanical characteristics make it both ecologically significant and economically valuable."
