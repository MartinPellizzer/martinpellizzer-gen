    "intro": "Dryopteris armata, commonly known as the rock brake fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its sturdy, wiry rhizomes and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often found in shaded, humid environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
