    "intro": "Dryopteris kamtschatica, commonly known as the Kamchatka wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the cold climates of eastern Asia, including parts of Russia and Japan. It is characterized by its robust fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in distinct lines. This species is well adapted to cool, temperate climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
