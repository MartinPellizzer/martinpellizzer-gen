It is native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, typically growing in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. Draba ventosa is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stability and providing food for pollinators."
