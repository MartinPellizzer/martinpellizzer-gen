It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forests and rocky areas. The plant features large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into segments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. This fern is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
