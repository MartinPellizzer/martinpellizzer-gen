    "intro": "Dryopteris albidipilosa, commonly known as the white-haired wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The botanical features of Dryopteris albidipilosa make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to botanical gardens and natural habitats."
