    "intro": "Dendrobium equitans, commonly known as the mounted orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and serve as storage organs for water and nutrients. Dendrobium equitans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
