    "intro": "Dimorphocalyx poilanei, commonly known as the Madagascar candlewood, is a unique member of the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, candle-like inflorescences that bear both showy and inconspicuous flowers. The plant exhibits a distinctive dimorphism in its floral structure, with some flowers being brightly colored and others remaining small and pale. Native to Madagascar, it thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after species in horticulture, though it is relatively rare in cultivation."
