    "intro": "Dodonaea spatulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf hop bush, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Dodonaea spatulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for native wildlife."
