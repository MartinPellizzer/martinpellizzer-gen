    "intro": "Digitaria sanguinalis var. rhachiseta, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in pairs, with the lower spikelet often being shorter and more compact. Its leaves are generally narrow and covered with short, stiff hairs, contributing to its rough texture. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
