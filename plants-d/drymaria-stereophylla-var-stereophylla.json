    "intro": "Drymaria stereophylla var. stereophylla, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features prostrate stems that produce small, white to pale pink flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-white, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
