    "intro": "Dactylorhiza traunsteineri subsp. turfosa, commonly known as the Turf Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, thick rhizome and produces a single, erect stem bearing a few showy, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, moist, and shaded habitats, often found in heaths and mountain meadows. It is characterized by its small, strap-shaped leaves and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
