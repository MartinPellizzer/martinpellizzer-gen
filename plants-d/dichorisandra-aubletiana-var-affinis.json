It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of velvety, waxy leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom from the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires indirect light to prevent leaf burn. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant."
