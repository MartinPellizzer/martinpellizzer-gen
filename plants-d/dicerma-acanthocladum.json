    "intro": "Dicerma acanthocladum, commonly known as the prickly cypress, is a unique evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage that gives it a distinct appearance. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are leathery and covered in fine, sharp spines, contributing to its rugged look. Dicerma acanthocladum is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas."
