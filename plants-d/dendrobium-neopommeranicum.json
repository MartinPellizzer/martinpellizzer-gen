It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and store water, enabling it to survive in dry periods. Dendrobium neopommeranicum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated for its unique appearance."
