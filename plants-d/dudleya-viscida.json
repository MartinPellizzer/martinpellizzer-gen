It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky habitats and has a compact, rosette-shaped structure. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the spring. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
