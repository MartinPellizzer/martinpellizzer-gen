    "intro": "Drosera dichrosepala, commonly known as the pink-scented sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sweet-smelling nectar to attract insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as swamps and bogs. Its leaves are covered in red or pinkish droplets that help in trapping prey. Drosera dichrosepala is a low-growing plant with a rosette structure, and it produces small, white flowers during the warmer months."
