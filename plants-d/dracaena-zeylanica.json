    "intro": "Dracaena zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon dragon tree, is a tropical plant native to Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and rosette of sword-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed. Dracaena zeylanica thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and air-purifying properties."
