    "intro": "Dioscorea subcalva var. subcalva, commonly known as the slender yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are slender and twining. The tubers are valued for their starchy content and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
