    "intro": "Dendropanax hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan sycamore or Hainan panax, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hainan in China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
