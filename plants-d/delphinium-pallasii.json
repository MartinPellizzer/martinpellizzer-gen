    "intro": "Delphinium pallasii, commonly known as Pallas's larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and alternate along the stem, with a slightly hairy surface. Delphinium pallasii is known for its ornamental value in gardens but is also toxic to livestock and humans due to its presence of alkaloids."
