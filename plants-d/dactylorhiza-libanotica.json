It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
