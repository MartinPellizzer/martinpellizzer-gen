It features slender, creeping stems that often lie flat on the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a soft, hairy texture. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
