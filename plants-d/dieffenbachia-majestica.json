    "intro": "Dieffenbachia majestica, commonly known as the Giant Dieffenbachia, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, waxy, dark green leaves with prominent white and yellow veins, which give it a dramatic appearance. The plant is a member of the Araceae family, known for its unique inflorescence structure consisting of a spadix and spathe. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as its sap can cause skin irritation."
