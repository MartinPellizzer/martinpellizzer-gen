    "intro": "Dortmanna fistulosa, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. It has small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or partially submerged. Dortmanna fistulosa is a carnivorous plant, using its specialized bladder-like traps to capture and digest prey."
