    "intro": "Dichondra repens var. carolinensis, commonly known as Carolina moonflower, is a low-growing, trailing plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery fuzz, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense mats in garden settings."
