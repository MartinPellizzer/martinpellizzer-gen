    "intro": "Dryopteris caryotidea, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. The botanical features of D. caryotidea make it a striking addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
