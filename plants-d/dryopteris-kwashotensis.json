    "intro": "Dryopteris kwashotensis, commonly known as the Kwashotensian wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its sturdy, upright fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, fibrous roots that help anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a common sight in forest understories."
