    "intro": "Dryopteris guanchica, commonly known as the Canary Island wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns. The plant's adaptability to volcanic soils and its ornamental value make it a notable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
