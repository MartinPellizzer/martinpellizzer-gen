    "intro": "Duggena hayesii, commonly known as the Hayes' duggena, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
