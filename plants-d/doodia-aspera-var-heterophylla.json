    "intro": "Doodia aspera var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable fern, is a variant of the rough maidenhair fern. It is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its variable leaf morphology. The plant features delicate, pinnately divided fronds that can vary in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical interest lies in its morphological plasticity, making it a subject of study in plant adaptation and evolution."
