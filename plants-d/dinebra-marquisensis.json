    "intro": "Dinebra marquisensis, commonly known as the Marquis Island lichen, is a unique organism that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is a symbiotic composite of a fungus and a green alga, forming a lichen thallus. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks and rocks in tropical rainforests. Its structure consists of a dense, leathery cortex with a sorediate surface, which aids in its survival in moist conditions. Dinebra marquisensis plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
