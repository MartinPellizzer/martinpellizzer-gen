    "intro": "Dyssodia roseata, commonly known as the pink dyssodia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Dyssodia roseata is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
