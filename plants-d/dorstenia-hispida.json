    "intro": "Dorstenia hispida, commonly known as the roughleaf woodspurry, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that are often covered in stiff, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Dorstenia hispida is adapted to grow in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in forest margins or open woodlands. Its structure and growth habits make it an interesting subject for botanical study and horticultural cultivation."
