    "intro": "Dryopteris cognata, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, elongated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, acidic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris cognata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
