    "intro": "Durio griffithii, commonly known as the giant durian, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, spiky fruit that can weigh up to 10 kilograms. The plant produces a strong, often unpleasant odor, which is a key feature of the durian genus. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing before the fruit develops. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and is valued for both its fruit and its ornamental qualities."
