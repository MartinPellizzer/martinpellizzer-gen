    "intro": "Deschampsia neumaniana, commonly known as Neuman's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Deschampsia neumaniana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
