    "intro": "Delosperma litorale, commonly known as the coastal iceplant, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in summer. It is often found growing on rocky shores and sandy soils near the coast. Delosperma litorale is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils against erosion."
