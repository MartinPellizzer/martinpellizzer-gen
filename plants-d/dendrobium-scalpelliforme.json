    "intro": "Dendrobium scalpelliforme, commonly known as the scalpel-shaped orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive, narrow shape resembling a scalpel. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
