    "intro": "Dalbergia boinensis, commonly known as the Bornean rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are small and typically arranged in clusters. It produces legumes as fruits, which contain flattened seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its rarity and demand, Dalbergia boinensis is also considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
