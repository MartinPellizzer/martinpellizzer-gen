It typically forms dense clusters of basal leaves that are soft and hairy, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Draba gracilis var. mollissima is often found in mountainous areas and is a characteristic component of alpine vegetation."
