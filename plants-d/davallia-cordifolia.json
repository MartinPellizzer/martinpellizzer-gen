    "intro": "Davallia cordifolia, commonly known as the heart's leaf fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped fronds that are typically light green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining soil. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps anchor it to rocky surfaces or in crevices. Davallia cordifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and ease of care."
