It features delicate, shield-shaped fronds that are typically less than 12 inches in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread across moist, shaded environments. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, with a fine, feathery texture. Darea asplenioides thrives in humid conditions and is often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil."
