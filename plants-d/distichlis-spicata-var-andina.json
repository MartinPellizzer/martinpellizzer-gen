    "intro": "Distichlis spicata var. andina, commonly known as the Andean bulrush, is a salt-tolerant plant native to coastal regions of South America. It is a perennial grass that thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in wetlands and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like clusters of small white flowers. Its ability to stabilize soil and filter water makes it ecologically significant in coastal ecosystems. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in restoration projects."
