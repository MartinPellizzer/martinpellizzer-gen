    "intro": "Dendrocolla, commonly known as the tree fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Cyatheaceae. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that resemble a tree's canopy. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to anchor itself in moist, shaded environments. Dendrocolla thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in humid forests. Its growth is slow, and it can live for many decades, making it a symbol of longevity in botanical gardens."
