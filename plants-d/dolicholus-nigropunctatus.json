    "intro": "Dolicholus nigropunctatus, commonly known as the black-spotted longhorn beetle, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Cerambycidae. It is characterized by its elongated body and distinctive black coloration with prominent punctuate markings. The plant associated with this beetle is the host tree, typically a member of the Fabaceae family, such as Acacia or Prosopis. The beetle's larvae develop within the stems of these host plants, feeding on the plant tissue. This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by contributing to the decomposition process and nutrient cycling."
