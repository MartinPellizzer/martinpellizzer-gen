    "intro": "Dryopteris kinokuniensis, commonly known as the Kikuchi shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into triangular segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
