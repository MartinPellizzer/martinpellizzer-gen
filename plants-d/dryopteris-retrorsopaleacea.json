    "intro": "Dryopteris retrorsopaleacea, commonly known as the pale frond fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pale-green fronds that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. This fern is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
