    "intro": "Damasonium stellatum var. polyspermum, commonly known as the star sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, often forming a rosette structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in areas with standing water or high humidity. This variant is distinguished by its increased seed production compared to the typical species, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
