    "intro": "Datura erinacea, commonly known as the thornapple or devil's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and large, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces egg-shaped, spiny fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it a member of the nightshade family. Datura erinacea thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its flowers open in the evening and emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract nocturnal pollinators."
