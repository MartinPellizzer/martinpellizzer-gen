    "intro": "Dyckia walteriana, commonly known as the Walter's Dyckia, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth habit with stiff, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces inflorescences that are typically red or orange, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Dyckia walteriana is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a container plant due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
