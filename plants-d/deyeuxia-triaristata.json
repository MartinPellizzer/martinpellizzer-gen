    "intro": "Deyeuxia triaristata, commonly known as the three-awned sedge, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, including China, India, and Japan. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear three awns on each lemma, giving it its common name. It is often found in shallow water or saturated soil, making it an important component of aquatic and wetland ecosystems. Deyeuxia triaristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity."
