    "intro": "Dorstenia goetzei, commonly known as the \"Cock's comb\" or \"Cock's comb plant,\" is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped inflorescence that resembles a rooster's comb, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically elongated and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Dorstenia goetzei is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
