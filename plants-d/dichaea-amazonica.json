    "intro": "Dichaea amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian dichaea, is a rare bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that can range from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, forming an epiphytic relationship with its host. Its leaves are usually broad and waxy, designed to collect and retain moisture from the humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dichaea amazonica is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
