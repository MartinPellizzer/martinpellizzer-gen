    "intro": "Dactylorhiza magna subsp. kulikalonica, commonly known as the giant marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in wet, boggy habitats and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. It has a complex root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
