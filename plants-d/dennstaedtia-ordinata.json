    "intro": "Dennstaedtia ordinata, commonly known as the common sword fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its sword-shaped, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new growth from the base, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
