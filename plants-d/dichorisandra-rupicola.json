    "intro": "Dichorisandra rupicola, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with multiple stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Dichorisandra rupicola thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in rocky crevices."
