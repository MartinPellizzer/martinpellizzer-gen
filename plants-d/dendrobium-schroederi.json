    "intro": "Dendrobium schroederi, commonly known as the Schr\u00f6der's orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that attracts pollinators. Dendrobium schroederi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
