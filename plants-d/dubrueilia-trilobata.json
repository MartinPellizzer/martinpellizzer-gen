    "intro": "Dubrueilia trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with three distinct lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap, typical of the Asclepiadaceae family, is a distinguishing feature. Dubrueilia trilobata thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
