    "intro": "Daucus communis var. marcidus, commonly known as the slender wild carrot, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that grow up to 60 cm in height, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are alternate along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its fruits are small, dry, and ridged, resembling those of other carrots, though it is not cultivated for food. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
