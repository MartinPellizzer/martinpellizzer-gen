    "intro": "Daucus carota subsp. parviflorus, commonly known as the dwarf carrot or parviflorus carrot, is a subspecies of the wild carrot. It is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its small, yellow flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant produces a slender, often branched stem that bears umbels of tiny white flowers. Its root system is typically less developed compared to the cultivated carrot, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is valued in ecological gardens for its ability to attract pollinators and its role in supporting biodiversity."
