    "intro": "Dicranolepis bussei, commonly known as the African rock fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit on rocky substrates. The plant features small, ovate to lanceolate fronds with a leathery texture and a distinctive, dark green coloration. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of spongy tissue, which helps it survive in arid conditions. Dicranolepis bussei is typically found in rocky outcrops and crevices, where it thrives in well-drained, mineral-rich soils."
