    "intro": "Diplazium distentum, commonly known as the broadleaf staghorn fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, and often umbrella-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in diameter. The plant has a distinctive rhizome system that supports its growth and helps anchor it to surfaces such as trees or rocks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, typically in clusters called sori. Diplazium distentum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments."
