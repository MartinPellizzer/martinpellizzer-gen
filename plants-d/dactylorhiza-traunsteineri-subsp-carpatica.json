    "intro": "Dactylorhiza traunsteineri subsp. carpatica, commonly known as the Carpathian marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Carpathian region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces erect, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent lip petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and peat bogs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
