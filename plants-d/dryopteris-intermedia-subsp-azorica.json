    "intro": "Dryopteris intermedia subsp. azorica, commonly known as the Azorean shield fern, is a fern species native to the Azores. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into shield-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. This subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
