    "intro": "Diapensia bulleyana, commonly known as the Bulleyan's diapensia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or heathland environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
