It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and meadows. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils. Its fine texture and dense growth habit make it a useful ornamental and forage plant."
