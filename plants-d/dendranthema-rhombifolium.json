It features aromatic, hairy, and often gray-green leaves that are rhombic in shape, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers with white centers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils are used in herbal remedies and aromatherapy due to their calming properties."
