    "intro": "Drosera indica f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered sundew, is a variant of the common sundew native to Southeast Asia. It is a carnivorous plant that thrives in nutrient-poor, wet environments such as bogs and marshes. The plant is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested to supplement its nutrient intake. Its flowers are distinctive for their white coloration, which sets it apart from the typical red or pink hues of other Drosera species. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
