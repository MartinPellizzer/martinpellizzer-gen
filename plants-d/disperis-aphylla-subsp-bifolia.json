    "intro": "Disperis aphylla subsp. bifolia, commonly known as the two-leaved disperis, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in pairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
