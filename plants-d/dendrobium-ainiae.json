    "intro": "Dendrobium ainiae, commonly known as the Borneo orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a complex structure typical of orchids. Dendrobium ainiae is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as forests and cliffs, where it can access sufficient light and moisture. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and botanists."
