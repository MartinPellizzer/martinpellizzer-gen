    "intro": "Digitaria cruciata var. pectinata, commonly known as the hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
