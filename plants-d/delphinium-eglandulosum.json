    "intro": "Delphinium eglandulosum, commonly known as the nakedleaf larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are glandless, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or woodland habitats. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
