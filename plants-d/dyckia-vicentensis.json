    "intro": "Dyckia vicentensis, commonly known as the Vicente's Dyckia, is a species of flowering plant in the bromeliad family, Bromeliaceae. It is native to South America, specifically found in Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, branched stem bearing small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Dyckia vicentensis is well adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
