    "intro": "Diosma lycopodioides, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the sporangia for spore production. Diosma lycopodioides thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
