It features striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often with a distinctive horn-like shape. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces small, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated for its beauty and ability to attract pollinators."
