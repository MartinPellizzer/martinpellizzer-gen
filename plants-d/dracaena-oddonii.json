    "intro": "Dracaena oddonii, commonly known as the Madagascar dragon tree, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, spire-like inflorescence that bears small, white flowers clustered around a central red or orange spike. The plant has dark green, strap-shaped leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena oddonii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
