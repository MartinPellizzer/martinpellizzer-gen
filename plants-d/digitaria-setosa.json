It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Digitaria setosa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
