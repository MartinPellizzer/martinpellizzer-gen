    "intro": "Dendrobium njongense, commonly known as the Njong's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Cameroon. It is characterized by its long, erect pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically has narrow, strap-like leaves and produces flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. It prefers shady, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in shaded undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
