    "intro": "Diplazium macropterum, commonly known as the large-winged water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged in water. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium macropterum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
