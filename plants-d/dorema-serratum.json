    "intro": "Dorema serratum, commonly known as the mountain thyme or serrated dorema, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with aromatic, narrow leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found at high elevations. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves and flowers, are used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Dorema serratum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to harsh climates."
