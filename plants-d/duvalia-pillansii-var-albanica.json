    "intro": "Duvalia pillansii var. albanica, commonly known as the Albanian duvalia, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
