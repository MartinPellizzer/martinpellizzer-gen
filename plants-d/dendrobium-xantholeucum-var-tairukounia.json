    "intro": "Dendrobium xantholeucum var. tairukounia, commonly known as the Tairukounia Dendrobium, is a hybrid orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems that produce clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued in horticulture for its unique floral display and adaptability to cultivated conditions."
