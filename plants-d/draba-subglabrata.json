It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its simple, basal leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils at high elevations. Draba subglabrata is known for its compact growth habit and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine flora and a subject of interest in plant ecology studies."
