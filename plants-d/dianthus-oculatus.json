    "intro": "Dianthus oculatus, commonly known as the eye flower or the pink rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Dianthus oculatus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
