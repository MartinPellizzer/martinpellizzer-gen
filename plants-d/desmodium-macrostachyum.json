    "intro": "Desmodium macrostachyum, commonly known as the large-stemmed burr legume, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is known for its distinctive, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
