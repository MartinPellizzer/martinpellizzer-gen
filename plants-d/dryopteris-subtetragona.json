    "intro": "Dryopteris subtetragona, commonly known as the four-lobed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that are typically divided into four distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, which help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage and contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
