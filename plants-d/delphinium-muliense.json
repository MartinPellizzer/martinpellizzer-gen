    "intro": "Delphinium muliense, commonly known as the Muli delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged alternately along the stem, with a rough texture. Delphinium muliense is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
