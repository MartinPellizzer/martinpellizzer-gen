    "intro": "Dryopteris christiana, commonly known as the Christ's Shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and delicate, pinnate fronds. The fronds are typically dark green, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, shield-like shape that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
