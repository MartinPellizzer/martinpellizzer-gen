    "intro": "Dryopteris contermina var. bisymmetros, commonly known as the bisymmetric shield fern, is a varietal form of the shield fern native to the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America. This fern is characterized by its distinctive bisymmetric fronds, which are divided into pairs of pinnae that mirror each other along the central axis. The fronds are typically dark green, with a leathery texture and a serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rich, well-drained soils along stream banks or in forest understories. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its role in the forest ecosystem's reproductive cycle."
