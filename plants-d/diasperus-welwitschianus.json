    "intro": "Diasperus welwitschianus, commonly known as the Welwitschia, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is one of the oldest known seed plants, with a lineage dating back over 140 million years. The plant features a thick, woody trunk and large, leathery leaves that can grow up to three meters in length. It has adapted to extreme arid conditions by storing water in its trunk and having a slow growth rate. Its distinctive morphology and longevity make it a subject of scientific interest and a symbol of the Namib Desert's unique ecosystem."
