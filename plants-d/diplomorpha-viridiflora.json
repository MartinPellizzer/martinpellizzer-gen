    "intro": "Diplomorpha viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within forest understories. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike. Its botanical significance lies in its unique coloration and ecological role in supporting pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
