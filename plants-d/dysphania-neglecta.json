    "intro": "Dysphania neglecta, commonly known as common lambsquarters, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and its small, inconspicuous flowers that develop in clusters. The plant produces seeds in a dry, three-angled capsule, which is typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as fields, roadsides, and gardens, due to its rapid growth and adaptability. Dysphania neglecta is also known for its nutritional value, containing high levels of protein and minerals."
