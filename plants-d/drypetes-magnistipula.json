    "intro": "Drypetes magnistipula, commonly known as the giant-stippled tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by reddish or orange fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in moist, shaded conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of the forest ecosystem, supporting various forms of wildlife."
