    "intro": "Deyeuxia neglecta var. americana, commonly known as the American meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and adaptability."
