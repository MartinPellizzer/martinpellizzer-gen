    "intro": "Dicksonia martiana, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive silvery-white coloration on the underside of its fronds, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Dicksonia martiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
