    "intro": "Dendrobium torajaense, commonly known as the Toraja orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia. It is characterized by its upright, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking inflorescences with numerous fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
