    "intro": "Daemonorops bakauensis, commonly known as the Barking Palm, is a species of cycad-like plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
