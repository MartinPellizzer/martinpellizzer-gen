    "intro": "Droguetia iners, commonly known as the sticky droguetia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its stems are often covered in a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Droguetia iners is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
