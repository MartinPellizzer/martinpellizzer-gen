    "intro": "Delphinium lacostei, commonly known as the Sierra delphinium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Delphinium lacostei is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
