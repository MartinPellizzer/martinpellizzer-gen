    "intro": "Duvernoia pyramidata, commonly known as the Chinese cliff brake, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like foliage composed of overlapping, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important subject for conservation and botanical study."
