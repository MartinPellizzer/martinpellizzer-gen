    "intro": "Diplostemma, commonly known as the \"false holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their opposite, simple leaves and showy, often clustered flowers. The flowers are usually yellow or orange, with five petals and a prominent corona, which is a distinctive ring-like structure around the stamens. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, and the plant contains milky sap that can be toxic."
