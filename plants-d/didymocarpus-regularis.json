    "intro": "Didymocarpus regularis, commonly known as the red sanders, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, aromatic bark and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink in color. The plant produces woody fruits that contain flat, seed-like structures called arils. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to its slow growth and high demand for its valuable timber, it is considered an endangered species."
