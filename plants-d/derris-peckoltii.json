    "intro": "Derris peckoltii, commonly known as the peckoltii derris, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is notable for containing the alkaloid rotenone, which has insecticidal properties. Due to its toxic compounds, it is often avoided in agricultural settings but is studied for its potential in pest control."
