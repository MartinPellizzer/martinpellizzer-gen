    "intro": "Delphinium hajrae, commonly known as the Kashmiri larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of showy, blue to violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its elegant appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
