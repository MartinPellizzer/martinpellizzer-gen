    "intro": "Drosera arcturi, commonly known as the Arctic rose or Arctic sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the Arctic tundra. It is characterized by its low-growing, cushion-like structure and produces small, sticky glands on its leaves that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically reddish or purple in color, which helps it absorb sunlight in its harsh, light environment. Drosera arcturi is adapted to cold climates and can survive in permafrost conditions by remaining dormant during winter. It is a rare and specialized species, showcasing unique adaptations for survival in extreme environments."
