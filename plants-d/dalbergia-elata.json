    "intro": "Dalbergia elata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
