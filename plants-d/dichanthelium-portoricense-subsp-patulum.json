    "intro": "Dichanthelium portoricense subsp. patulum, commonly known as the broadleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two bracts, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
