It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that open at dawn and close at dusk. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of water, while its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the aquatic environment. Decandolia is known for its symbolic significance in Egyptian culture, representing rebirth and spiritual purity. Its botanical structure includes a thick, woody stem and a distinctive, palmate leaf pattern."
