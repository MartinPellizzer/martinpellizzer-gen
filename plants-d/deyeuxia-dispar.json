    "intro": "Deyeuxia dispar, commonly known as the narrowleaf false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and forest edges. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often leafless above the base, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are finely toothed. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Deyeuxia dispar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
