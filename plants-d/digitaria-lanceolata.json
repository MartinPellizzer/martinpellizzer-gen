    "intro": "Digitaria lanceolata, commonly known as slender fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open areas, wetlands, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a creeping growth habit with rhizomes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often found in association with other grasses in natural and agricultural ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, Digitaria lanceolata can be both a valuable forage plant and a weed in cultivated fields."
