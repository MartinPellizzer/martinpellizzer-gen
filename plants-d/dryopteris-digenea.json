    "intro": "Dryopteris digenea, commonly known as the two-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into two main veins, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round interest in the woodland setting."
