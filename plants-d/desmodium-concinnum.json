    "intro": "Desmodium concinnum, commonly known as smallleaf burr mallow, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, spiny seed pods that enclose small, round seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woods and along streambanks. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, pale yellow flowers throughout the growing season. Desmodium concinnum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
