    "intro": "Digitaria marginata var. fimbriata, commonly known as the fringe-blades grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its narrow, flat leaves with a distinctive fringed edge, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
