    "intro": "Desmodium tomentosum, commonly known as hairy beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a dense, woolly covering of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, pink or purple flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. Desmodium tomentosum is often used in traditional medicine and can be a useful plant for soil stabilization in ecological restoration projects."
