It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in raceme inflorescences, with distinctive white margins on the petals. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, with a rough, hairy texture. Delphinium albomarginatum is valued in horticulture for its striking floral display and is often cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
