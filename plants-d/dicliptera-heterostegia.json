    "intro": "Dicliptera heterostegia, commonly known as the African bristlegrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Dicliptera heterostegia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
