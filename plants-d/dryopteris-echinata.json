    "intro": "Dryopteris echinata, commonly known as the holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris echinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its attractive foliage."
