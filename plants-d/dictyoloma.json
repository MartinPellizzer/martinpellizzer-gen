    "intro": "Dictyoloma, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers. Dictyoloma species typically have basal leaves that are lanceolate or ovate in shape. They are often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
