    "intro": "Dissotis theifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
