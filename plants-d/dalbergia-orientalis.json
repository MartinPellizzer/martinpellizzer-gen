    "intro": "Dalbergia orientalis, commonly known as the Persian rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to regions of Asia, including Iran and parts of the Middle East. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces hard, dark wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It thrives in dry, warm climates and is often found in rocky or arid soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
