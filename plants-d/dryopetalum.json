    "intro": "Dryopetalum, commonly known as the snowbell, is a genus of flowering plants in the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to the eastern United States. The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that are often white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters. Its leaves are typically opposite, simple, and oval in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds."
