It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive pod fruits. The plant is notable for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with ants, which reside in the hollow stems and protect the plant from herbivores. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a yellowish or greenish hue, and it produces edible seeds that are used in traditional medicine."
