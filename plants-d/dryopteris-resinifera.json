    "intro": "Dryopteris resinifera, commonly known as the resinous wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, resinous coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
