    "intro": "Diplodium depauperatum, commonly known as the poorflower, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Cape region of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Diplodium depauperatum is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
