    "intro": "Dracaena preussii, commonly known as the Red Edge Dracaena, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, dark green leaves with bright red margins that add visual interest to any setting. The plant has a straight, unbranched stem that can grow up to several meters tall, making it suitable for indoor spaces or as a houseplant. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Dracaena preussii is relatively low maintenance, thriving in indirect light and requiring minimal watering."
