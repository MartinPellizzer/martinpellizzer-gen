    "intro": "Delphinium staphydium, commonly known as the Alpine larkspur, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are notable for their spurred petals. Delphinium staphydium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock and humans."
