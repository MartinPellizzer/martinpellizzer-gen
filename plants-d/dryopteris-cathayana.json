    "intro": "Dryopteris cathayana, commonly known as the Chinese wood fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium."
