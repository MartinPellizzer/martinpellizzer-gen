    "intro": "Disphyma crassifolium subsp. crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved disphyma, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, a feature typical of plants in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and native garden landscaping."
