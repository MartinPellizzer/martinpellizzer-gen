    "intro": "Diplusodon lanceolatus var. scaber, commonly known as the roughleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Southeast Asia. It features slender, triangular stems that are often ribbed or scabrous, giving it its varietal name \"scaber.\" The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, three-lobed flowers, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, with a rough texture due to prominent longitudinal ridges. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
