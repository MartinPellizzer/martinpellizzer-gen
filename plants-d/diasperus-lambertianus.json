    "intro": "Diasperus lambertianus, commonly known as the Lambert's spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers clustered in cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. The latex it secretes is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care."
