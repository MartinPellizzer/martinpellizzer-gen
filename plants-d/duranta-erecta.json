    "intro": "Duranta erecta, commonly known as the skyflower or golden bell, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow, often with a red or orange throat. These flowers are followed by blue or violet berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Duranta erecta is known for its adaptability and is often cultivated in warm climates for its ornamental value."
