    "intro": "Drynaria angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and a crown of feathery, dark green fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
