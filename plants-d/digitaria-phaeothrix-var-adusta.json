    "intro": "Digitaria phaeothrix var. adusta, commonly known as the dark green panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, dark green leaves that are often densely packed. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, which are typical of the Paniceae tribe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it a useful plant for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
