    "intro": "Dryopteris sancta var. ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian wood fern, is a species of fern native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in high-altitude regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
