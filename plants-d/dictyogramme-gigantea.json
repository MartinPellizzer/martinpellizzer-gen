    "intro": "Dictyogramme gigantea, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large aquatic fern native to tropical regions. It has feathery, delicate fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, anchoring it to the substrate and facilitating vegetative propagation. The fronds are capable of floating on the water surface, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
