It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often grow in open, disturbed habitats. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, with prominent veins running along their length. Dichanthelium consanguineum is often found in sandy or clay soils and is adapted to a variety of environmental conditions."
