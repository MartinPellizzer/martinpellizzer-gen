    "intro": "Draba peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, high-altitude regions. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, rounded seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Draba peruviana is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
