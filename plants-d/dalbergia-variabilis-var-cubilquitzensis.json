    "intro": "Dalbergia variabilis var. cubilquitzensis, commonly known as the Mexican rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, with compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a tendency to produce thorns on young shoots, which contribute to its ecological role in its native habitat."
