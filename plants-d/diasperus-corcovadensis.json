    "intro": "Diasperus corcovadensis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement and are often used in traditional medicine. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, making it a sought-after material in craftsmanship. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
