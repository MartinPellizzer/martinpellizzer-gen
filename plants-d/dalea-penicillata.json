    "intro": "Dalea penicillata, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pinkish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pea-like pods that contain the seeds. Dalea penicillata is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
