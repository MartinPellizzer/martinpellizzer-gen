    "intro": "Diplazium ellipticum, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division. The leaves are typically elliptical in shape, with a dark green, leathery texture and a serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in spore dispersal in its natural habitat."
