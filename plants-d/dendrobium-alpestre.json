    "intro": "Dendrobium alpestre, commonly known as the alpine dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, adapting to its high-altitude environment. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, fragrant scent. Dendrobium alpestre is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated for its beauty and resilience."
