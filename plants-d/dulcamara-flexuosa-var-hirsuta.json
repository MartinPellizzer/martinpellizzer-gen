    "intro": "Dulcamara flexuosa var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing habit, with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces clusters of small, pale purple or white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive. Due to its rapid growth and persistent nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings."
