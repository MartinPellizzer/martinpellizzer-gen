It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters.

Dicymbe jenmanii is notable for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
