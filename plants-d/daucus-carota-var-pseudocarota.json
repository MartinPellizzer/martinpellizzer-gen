    "intro": "Daucus carota var. pseudocarota, commonly known as the Queen Anne's lace, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and white flowers that resemble a lace pattern, hence its common name. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade. While it is not typically cultivated for food, it has historical uses in herbal medicine and as a decorative plant."
