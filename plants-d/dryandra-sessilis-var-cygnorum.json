    "intro": "Dryandra sessilis var. cygnorum, commonly known as the Swan River dryandra, is a rare and unique plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its striking, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is typically found in sandy soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid regions of its native habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
