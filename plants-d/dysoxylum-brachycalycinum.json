It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
