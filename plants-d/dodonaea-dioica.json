It is characterized by its small, red or yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, hard pods containing seeds. The leaves are typically opposite, with a rough, velvety texture that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry inland regions. The plant is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in certain ecological contexts."
