It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and is often found in wet to moist forest habitats. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is primarily found in its native environment."
