    "intro": "Danais decaryi, commonly known as the Decary's danais, is a rare and unique plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth texture, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Danais decaryi is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of interest for conservation efforts."
