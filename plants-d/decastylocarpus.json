    "intro": "Decastylocarpus, commonly known as the double-fruit or two-seed plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique reproductive structure, where each fruit contains two seeds, hence the name \"decastylocarpus,\" derived from the Greek words for ten and seed. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in wet or marshy environments. Its leaves are usually alternate and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are showy, with five petals and numerous stamens, contributing to its ornamental value in some species."
