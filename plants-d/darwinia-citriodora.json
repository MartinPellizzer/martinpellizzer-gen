    "intro": "Darwinia citriodora, commonly known as the lemon-scented Darwinia, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, terminal spikes of tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces distinctive, cigar-shaped seed pods that split open to release seeds when mature. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for gardens in temperate climates. The leaves are aromatic, releasing a lemony fragrance when crushed, which adds to its ornamental appeal."
