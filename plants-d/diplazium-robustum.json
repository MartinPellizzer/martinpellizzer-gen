    "intro": "Diplazium robustum, commonly known as the robust staghorn fern, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, spathaceous leaves that form a rosette shape, often resembling a staghorn. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
