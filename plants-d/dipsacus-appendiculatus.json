    "intro": "Dipsacus appendiculatus, commonly known as the common teasel, is a biennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, bristly stems and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces purple to pink flowers in late summer, which are followed by distinctive, spiny seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Dipsacus appendiculatus is known for its historical use in textile production, as the dried seed heads were used to raise woolen fabric."
