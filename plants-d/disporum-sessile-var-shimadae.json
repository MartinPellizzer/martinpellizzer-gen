    "intro": "Disporum sessile var. shimadae, commonly known as the Japanese yew or Japanese disporum, is a rare variant of the disporum species native to Japan. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
