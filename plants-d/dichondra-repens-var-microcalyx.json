    "intro": "Dichondra repens var. microcalyx, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to North America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it an effective ground cover plant."
