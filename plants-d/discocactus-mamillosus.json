    "intro": "Discocactus mamillosus, commonly known as the woolly discocactus, is a cacti species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiky appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
