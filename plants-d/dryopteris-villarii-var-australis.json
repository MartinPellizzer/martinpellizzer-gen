    "intro": "Dryopteris villarii var. australis, commonly known as the Australian shield fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to southeastern Australia. It features fronds that are typically leathery and dark green, with a distinctive shield-like shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
