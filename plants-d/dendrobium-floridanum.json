    "intro": "Dendrobium floridanum, commonly known as the Florida orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Dendrobium floridanum is an important species for ecological studies due to its unique adaptations to wetland environments."
