    "intro": "Dioscorea composita, commonly known as the composite yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. Its tubers are rich in starch and have been traditionally used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. The plant's growth habit and tuber morphology make it an important species in both agricultural and ethnobotanical contexts."
