    "intro": "Dryadella barrowii, commonly known as the Barrow's dryad, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in wetlands. Its delicate white to pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
