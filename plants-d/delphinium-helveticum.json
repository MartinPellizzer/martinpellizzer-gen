    "intro": "Delphinium helveticum, commonly known as the Swiss larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette and are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain poisonous alkaloids."
