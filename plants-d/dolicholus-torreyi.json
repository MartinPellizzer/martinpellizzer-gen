It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among members of its family. Dolicholus torreyi typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss."
