    "intro": "Dendrobium pendulicaule, commonly known as the pendant orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers. Its leaves are typically clustered and lance-shaped, adapted for efficient water absorption. Dendrobium pendulicaule is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions."
