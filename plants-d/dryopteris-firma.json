    "intro": "Dryopteris firma, commonly known as the hard shield fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its sturdy, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing fertile fronds that are often shorter and more rigid than the sterile ones. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for landscaping in shaded garden areas."
