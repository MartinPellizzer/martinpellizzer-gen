    "intro": "Deyeuxia sylvatica var. brachytricha, commonly known as the short-haired wood sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and dense foliage make it an important component of wetland ecosystems. The variety brachytricha is distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescence compared to the typical form."
