    "intro": "Dischisma crassum, commonly known as the thickleaf dischisma, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, exhibiting a compact, shrub-like growth habit. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid environments, while its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Dischisma crassum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
