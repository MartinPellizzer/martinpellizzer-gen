    "intro": "Dichanthelium macrospermum, commonly known as the large-seeded grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are notably large and have a distinctive, rough surface, aiding in seed dispersal. Dichanthelium macrospermum is often found in moist, open habitats such as prairies and wetlands."
