    "intro": "Dianthera crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved dianthera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
