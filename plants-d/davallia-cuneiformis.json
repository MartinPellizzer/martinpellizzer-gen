    "intro": "Davallia cuneiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a distinctive, upright rhizome with clustered, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and leathery. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the fronds, which are typically reddish-brown in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
