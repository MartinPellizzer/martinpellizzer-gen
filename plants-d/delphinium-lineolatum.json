    "intro": "Delphinium lineolatum, commonly known as the spotted larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or silver midrib, giving it a striking appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
