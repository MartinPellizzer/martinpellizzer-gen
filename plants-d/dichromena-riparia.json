    "intro": "Dichromena riparia, commonly known as the river dichromena, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and riverbanks of Southeast Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil along water edges. Dichromena riparia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
