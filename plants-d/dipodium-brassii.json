    "intro": "Dipodium brassii, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that display a vibrant yellow-green hue. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its host, while its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern that enhances its ornamental appeal. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections."
