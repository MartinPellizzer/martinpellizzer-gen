    "intro": "Ditassa dardanoi, commonly known as the Dardanian orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Dardanelles. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stem and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to thrive. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
