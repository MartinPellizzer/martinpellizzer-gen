    "intro": "Dryopteris otaria, commonly known as the rock holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the northern hemisphere. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The plant features fronds that are typically leathery and have a distinctive, upright growth habit. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The botanical structure of Dryopteris otaria includes a rhizome that supports the growth of its sterile and fertile fronds."
