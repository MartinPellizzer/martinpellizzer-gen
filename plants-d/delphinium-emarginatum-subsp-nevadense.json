    "intro": "Delphinium emarginatum subsp. nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra delphinium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
