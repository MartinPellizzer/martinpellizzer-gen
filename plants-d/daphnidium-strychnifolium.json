    "intro": "Daphnidium strychnifolium, commonly known as the poison ivy of Madagascar, is a woody shrub native to the island nation. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other toxic plants such as poison ivy and cashew. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. Its most notable feature is the presence of urushiol, a toxic oil that causes dermatitis in humans upon contact. This plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories."
