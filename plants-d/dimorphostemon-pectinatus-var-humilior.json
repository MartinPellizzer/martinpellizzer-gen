    "intro": "Dimorphostemon pectinatus var. humilior, commonly known as the dwarf pectinatus, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, pectinate (toothed) structure on its leaves. The plant has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its textured appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established."
