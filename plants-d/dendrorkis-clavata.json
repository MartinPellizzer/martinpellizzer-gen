    "intro": "Dendrorkis clavata, commonly known as the club-shaped orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive club-like pseudobulbs and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
