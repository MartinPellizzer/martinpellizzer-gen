    "intro": "Dendrobium vitellinum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium vitellinum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
