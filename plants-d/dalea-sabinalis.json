    "intro": "Dalea sabinalis, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant features compound leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. It has adapted to survive in harsh conditions with deep roots and reduced leaf surface area. Dalea sabinalis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
