    "intro": "Doronicum toxicarium, commonly known as the toxic dwarf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Despite its attractive appearance, it is toxic to humans and animals, containing various alkaloids that can cause gastrointestinal distress if ingested."
