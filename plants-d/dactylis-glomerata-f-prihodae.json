It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are tightly clustered, giving it a distinctive appearance. This form is often found in temperate regions, particularly in grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and agricultural applications."
