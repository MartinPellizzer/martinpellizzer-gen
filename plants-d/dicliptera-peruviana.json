It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Dicliptera peruviana is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
