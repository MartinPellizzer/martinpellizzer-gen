    "intro": "Dendrobium rhodostele, commonly known as the red-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a tall, branched stem with numerous pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive red or orange lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
