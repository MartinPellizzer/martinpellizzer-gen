    "intro": "Dendrobium erectum, commonly known as the erect orchid, is a epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that can reach several feet in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. Its leaves are elliptical and arranged in two rows along the stem. Dendrobium erectum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
