    "intro": "Dracontia pachyglossa, commonly known as the broad-lipped dragon's beard, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its long, slender inflorescences that bear numerous small, showy flowers with distinctive, broad lips. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
