    "intro": "Diptera sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese horsefly, is a species of fly belonging to the family Tipulidae. It is native to China and is characterized by its robust body and distinctive wing patterns. The plant it interacts with, though not a plant itself, is often found in moist, forested areas where the fly's larvae develop in decaying organic matter. Its life cycle plays a role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
