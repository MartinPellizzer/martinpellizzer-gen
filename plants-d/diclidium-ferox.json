It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny capsules that encase its seeds. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellowish. The fruit, which is a type of capsule, splits open to release seeds equipped with tufts of hair for wind dispersal."
