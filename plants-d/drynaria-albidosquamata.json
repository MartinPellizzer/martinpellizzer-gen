It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique appearance with its silvery-white scales covering the trunk and young fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
