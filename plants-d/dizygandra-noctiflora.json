    "intro": "Dizygandra noctiflora, commonly known as the night-flowering star, is a rare and striking plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, star-shaped flowers that open at night and emit a strong, fragrant aroma to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often humid and tropical habitat. Its flowering cycle is closely tied to the lunar cycle, with blooms appearing in sync with the full moon. Botanically, it belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is noted for its unique adaptations to nighttime pollination."
