    "intro": "Detarium beurmannianum, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The tree produces elongated, woody pods that contain edible seeds used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Detarium beurmannianum plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity and soil stability in its native habitats."
