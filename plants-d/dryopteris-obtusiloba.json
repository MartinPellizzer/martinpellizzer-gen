    "intro": "Dryopteris obtusiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its large, lobed fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodlands and streamside areas. Its fronds are biennial, with the fiddleheads developing in the spring and unfurling throughout the summer. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in the forest understory."
