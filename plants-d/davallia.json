    "intro": "Davallia, commonly known as the horse's tail fern, is a genus of ferns characterized by its unique, creeping growth habit and delicate, feathery fronds. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, these plants thrive in humid environments with well-draining soil. The fronds are typically arching and composed of small, needle-like pinnae, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. Davallia species are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their aesthetic appeal and ease of care. They reproduce through spores, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
