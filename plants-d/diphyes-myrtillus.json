    "intro": "Diphyes myrtillus, commonly known as the wintergreen shrub, is a deciduous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that remain on the plant throughout the winter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are rich in methyl salicylate, giving the plant its characteristic wintergreen scent. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas."
