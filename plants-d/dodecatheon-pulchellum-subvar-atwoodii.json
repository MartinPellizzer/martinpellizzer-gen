    "intro": "Dodecatheon pulchellum subvar. atwoodii, commonly known as the Atwood's five-petaled bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodland areas and has lanceolate, hairy leaves. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. This subvariety is noted for its ornamental value and is often found in conservation efforts due to its limited distribution."
