    "intro": "Dendrobium imthurnii, commonly known as the Imthurn's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like stems that are often branched and covered with small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated for horticultural purposes but is also threatened by habitat loss."
