It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it is known for its latex sap, which is milky and sticky. Dorstenia quadrata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
