    "intro": "Dendrobium aurantiiroseum, commonly known as the orange rose orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with fleshy, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of orange and pink, often with a rose-like appearance. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in two ranks, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Dendrobium aurantiiroseum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
