    "intro": "Dactylorhiza cyrenaica, commonly known as the Cyrenaica orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to North Africa and the Middle East. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces a single, erect stem with several lance-shaped leaves and bears small, greenish-yellow flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and has a short growing season. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
