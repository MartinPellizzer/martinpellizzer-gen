It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces striking, pinkish-white flowers during the spring. It is part of the Proteaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with specialized adaptations for nutrient-poor soils. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
