    "intro": "Dactylorhiza savogiensis, commonly known as the Sicilian orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The plant features a pseudobulb-like structure and produces a single spike of fragrant, violet-colored flowers. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild."
