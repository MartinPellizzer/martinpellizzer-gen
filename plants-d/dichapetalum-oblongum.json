    "intro": "Dichapetalum oblongum, commonly known as the African mountain orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
