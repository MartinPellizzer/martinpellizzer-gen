    "intro": "Diabelia serrata f. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly diabelia, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with serrated edges, and it produces small, clustered flowers. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
