    "intro": "Delphinium tricorne var. patens, commonly known as the nodding larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care."
