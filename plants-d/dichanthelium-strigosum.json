    "intro": "Dichanthelium strigosum, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often stand upright. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. Its leaves are narrow, slightly hairy, and often have a bluish-green hue. Dichanthelium strigosum is typically found in moist to wet soils, often in wetlands or along the edges of ponds and streams."
