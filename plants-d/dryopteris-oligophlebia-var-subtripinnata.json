    "intro": "Dryopteris oligophlebia var. subtripinnata, commonly known as the subtripinnate wood fern, is a variant of the slender wood fern. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are often arching or cascading in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like foliage."
