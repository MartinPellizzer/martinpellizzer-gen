    "intro": "Drosophorus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It features large, broad leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still water. The plant has showy white or pink flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense mats. Drosophorus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
