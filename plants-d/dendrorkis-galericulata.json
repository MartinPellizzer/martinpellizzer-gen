    "intro": "Dendrorkis galericulata, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has long, slender leaves and grows as an epiphyte, often found on trees in tropical rainforests. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
