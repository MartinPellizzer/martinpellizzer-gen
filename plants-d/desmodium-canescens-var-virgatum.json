It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
