    "intro": "Dichondra evolvulacea f. major, commonly known as the large-leaf dichondra, is a variant of the dichondra species native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers."
