    "intro": "Dendrobium uliginosum, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with long, cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct, often fragrant scent. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Dendrobium uliginosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
