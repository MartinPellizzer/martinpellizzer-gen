    "intro": "Dryas oxyodonta, commonly known as the alpine avens, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Rosaceae. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in alpine and arctic regions, often found on rocky slopes and in open, sunny habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
