    "intro": "Diodia elongata, commonly known as longleaf diodia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, and it produces small, fruit-like structures called schizocarps that disperse its seeds. Diodia elongata is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
