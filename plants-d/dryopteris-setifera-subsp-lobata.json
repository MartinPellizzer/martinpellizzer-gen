    "intro": "Dryopteris setifera subsp. lobata, commonly known as the lobed wood fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that are often deeply divided, giving it a delicate and intricate appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
