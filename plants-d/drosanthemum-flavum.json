It is a low-growing, mat-forming species with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its compact growth habit and vibrant blooms, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
