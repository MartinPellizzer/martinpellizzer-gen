    "intro": "Dryopteris hastatopinnata, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its large, triangular-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into pinnate segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. The plant's robust and elegant appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
