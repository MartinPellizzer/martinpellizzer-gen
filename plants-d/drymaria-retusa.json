    "intro": "Drymaria retusa, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of wiry, branched stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. Drymaria retusa thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dunes."
