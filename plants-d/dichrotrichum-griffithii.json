    "intro": "Dichrotrichum griffithii, commonly known as the Indian hairgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is native to the Indian subcontinent and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with fine, hair-like leaves that give it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind. Dichrotrichum griffithii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
