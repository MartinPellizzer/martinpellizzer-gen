    "intro": "Delphinium palmatifidum var. hispidum, commonly known as the hispid larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that gives the plant its \"hispid\" designation. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
