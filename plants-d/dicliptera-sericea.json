It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, silver-haired leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
