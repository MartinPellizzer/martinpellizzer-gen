    "intro": "Dendrobium jamirusii, commonly known as the Sulu Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a yellow throat. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Dendrobium jamirusii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
