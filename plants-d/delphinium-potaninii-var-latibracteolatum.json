    "intro": "Delphinium potaninii var. latibracteolatum, commonly known as the broad-bract delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers in racemes, with distinctive, broad bracts that enclose the flower clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, typical of the Delphinium genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a striking addition to alpine gardens."
