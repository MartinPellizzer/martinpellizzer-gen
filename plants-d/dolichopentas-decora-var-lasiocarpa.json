    "intro": "Dolichopentas decora var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the velvetleaf poinsettia, is a variant of the poinsettia species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, velvety bracts that range in color from deep red to pink, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant has a short, woody stem and produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers at the base of the bracts. Its foliage is broad, ovate, and has a textured, slightly fuzzy surface. This variety is popular as a decorative plant, especially during the holiday season, due to its vibrant appearance and ease of cultivation."
