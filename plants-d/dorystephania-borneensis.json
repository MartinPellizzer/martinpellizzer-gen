    "intro": "Dorystephania borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean dodder vine, is a parasitic plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems of other plants through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant has a slender, vine-like appearance with small, scale-like leaves that are often difficult to detect. It produces yellowish flowers and is adapted to thrive in the humid, shaded environments of tropical forests. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
