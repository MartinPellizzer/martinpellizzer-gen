    "intro": "Diplazium sibuyanense, commonly known as the Sibuyan spleenwort, is a fern native to the Philippines, particularly found on the island of Sibuyan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the undersides of its fertile fronds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
