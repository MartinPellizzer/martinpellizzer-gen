    "intro": "Desmodium hirtum, commonly known as hairy ticktrefoil, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Desmodium hirtum is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration and agricultural systems."
