    "intro": "Diaphractanthus homolepis, commonly known as the rock fig, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are usually small and opposite, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Diaphractanthus homolepis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
