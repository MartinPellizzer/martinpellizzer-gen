    "intro": "Dioscorea spiculiflora var. fasciculocongesta, commonly known as the clustered-stalk yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are used for both food and traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with prominent veins. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The tubers of this variety are valued for their starchy texture and nutritional content."
