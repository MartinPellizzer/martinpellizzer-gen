    "intro": "Diaphananthe congolensis, commonly known as the Congo diaphananthe, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically yellow or white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forest ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
