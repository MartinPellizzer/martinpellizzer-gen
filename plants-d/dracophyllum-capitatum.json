    "intro": "Dracophyllum capitatum, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats or low shrubs. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often covered in a fine, white wax layer that helps reduce water loss. Dracophyllum capitatum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native insects and birds."
