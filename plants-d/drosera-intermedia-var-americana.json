    "intro": "Drosera intermedia var. americana, commonly known as the American sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden mucilage to trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wetlands. Its leaves are often rosette-shaped, and it produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. This variant is closely related to other Drosera species but is distinguished by its geographic distribution and specific habitat preferences."
