    "intro": "Daphne kingdon-wardii, commonly known as the Kingdon-Ward daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but often avoided by animals due to their bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant in temperate climates. Daphne kingdon-wardii is also valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its winter interest."
