    "intro": "Dudleya candida, commonly known as the white Dudleya, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green with a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking clusters of white flowers during the spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is well-suited for Mediterranean climates."
