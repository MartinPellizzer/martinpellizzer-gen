    "intro": "Deschampsia robusta, commonly known as tough bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. It is often found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed sites. Deschampsia robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
