    "intro": "Desmodium glutinosum f. unifoliatum, commonly known as the sticky desmodium, is a variant of the sticky desmodium species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being oval to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in dense, upright clusters. Its stems are often hairy and can become sticky due to the presence of glandular trichomes. The species is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
