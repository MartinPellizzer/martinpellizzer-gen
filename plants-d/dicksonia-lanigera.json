    "intro": "Dicksonia lanigera, commonly known as the woolly tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in compact, hairy structures called sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. The plant's unique appearance and ecological significance make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora."
