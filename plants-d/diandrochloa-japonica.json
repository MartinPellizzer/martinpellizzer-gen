    "intro": "Diandrochloa japonica, commonly known as Japanese sand couch, is a low-growing perennial grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils. The plant typically produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, followed by narrow, elongated seed heads. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as slopes and coastal areas. Its botanical features make it a hardy and resilient plant for ecological restoration projects."
