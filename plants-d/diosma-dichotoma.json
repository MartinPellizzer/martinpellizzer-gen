    "intro": "Diosma dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched diosma, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Diosma dichotoma is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep roots and a low, sprawling growth habit. It is often found in rocky soils and is used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
