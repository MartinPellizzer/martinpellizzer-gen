    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis subsp. ebudensis, commonly known as the dwarf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and northwest Africa. It typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and marshes. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with a short rhizome and a single, erect stem bearing a few lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pale green to yellowish, with a distinctive three-lobed lip, and bloom from late spring to early summer. It is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
