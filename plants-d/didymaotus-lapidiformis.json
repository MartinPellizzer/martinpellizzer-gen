    "intro": "Didymaotus lapidiformis, commonly known as the stone-like orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rock-like appearance, with small, dense leaves and elongated, pale green or yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or among moss-covered rocks. Its unique morphology allows it to blend seamlessly with its surroundings, providing camouflage from herbivores. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
