    "intro": "Danthonia flavescens var. cheesemanii, commonly known as the Cheeseman's danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically light green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are often pale yellow to golden in hue. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream margins, and other damp habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
