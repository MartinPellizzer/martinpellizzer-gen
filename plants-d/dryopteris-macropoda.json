    "intro": "Dryopteris macropoda, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. The plant's rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
