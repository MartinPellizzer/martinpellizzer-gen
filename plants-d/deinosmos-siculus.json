    "intro": "Deinosmos siculus, commonly known as the Sicilian giant orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the island of Sicily. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, featuring intricate patterns of purple and white. The plant typically grows in rocky, calcareous soils in open, sunny areas, often near cliffs or along coastal regions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it faces significant threats to its survival."
