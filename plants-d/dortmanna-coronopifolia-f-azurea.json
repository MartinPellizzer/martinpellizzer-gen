    "intro": "Dortmanna coronopifolia f. azurea, commonly known as the Azure Bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface. The blue-green coloration of its leaves is a distinguishing feature of this particular form."
