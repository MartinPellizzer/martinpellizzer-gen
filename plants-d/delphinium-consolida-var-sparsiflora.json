    "intro": "Delphinium consolida var. sparsiflora, commonly known as the slender larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and its root system consists of fibrous roots. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care."
