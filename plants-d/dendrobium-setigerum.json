    "intro": "Dendrobium setigerum, commonly known as the hairy lip orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive hairy lip. It prefers well-draining substrates and moderate light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Dendrobium setigerum is valued for its ornamental beauty and ease of care in suitable conditions."
