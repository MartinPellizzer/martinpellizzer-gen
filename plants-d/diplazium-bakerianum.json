    "intro": "Diplazium bakerianum, commonly known as the Baker's fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The plant features fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, shaded environments. Diplazium bakerianum is often found in forest understories where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade."
