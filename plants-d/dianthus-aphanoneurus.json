    "intro": "Dianthus aphanoneurus, commonly known as the ghost pinks, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like carnations and snapdragons. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
