    "intro": "Daemonorops macroptera, commonly known as the giant panda fern, is a species of cycad-like plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, spherical cones rather than flowers, which are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its striking appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
