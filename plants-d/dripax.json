    "intro": "Dripax, commonly known as the water lily, is a aquatic plant that thrives in shallow freshwater environments. It features broad, floating leaves that provide shade and oxygen to the water. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally. Dripax plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and improving water quality."
