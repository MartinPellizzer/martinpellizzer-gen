    "intro": "Dryopteris gracilis, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are short and thick, often forming dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
