    "intro": "Dryopteris haniffii, commonly known as the Haniff's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile ones in the second. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture and indirect light. Its spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the mature fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle in the wild. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
