    "intro": "Dudleya minor, commonly known as the narrowleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to coastal areas of California and Baja California. It features rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its drought tolerance, Dudleya minor is well-suited for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens."
