It is characterized by its pendulous, showy flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white or pink. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy beneath. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate, cascading blooms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
