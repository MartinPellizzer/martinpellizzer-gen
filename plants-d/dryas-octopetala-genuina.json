    "intro": "Dryas octopetala genuina, commonly known as the alpine avens, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of silvery, hairy leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters of eight, which is reflected in its scientific name. It thrives in alpine and arctic climates, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
