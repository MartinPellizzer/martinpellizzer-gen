    "intro": "Daphniphyllum himalense subsp. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate regions."
