    "intro": "Diomedea, commonly known as the albatross, is a genus of seabirds belonging to the family Diomedeidae. These birds are characterized by their large wingspans, which can reach up to 3.5 meters, and their long, narrow wings adapted for gliding over vast oceanic distances. Diomedea species are primarily found in the Southern Hemisphere, with some species migrating to the Northern Hemisphere during breeding seasons. They feed on fish, squid, and other marine organisms, often scavenging at the surface of the water. The genus includes several species, such as the wandering albatross and the black-browed albatross, all of which play important ecological roles in marine ecosystems."
