    "intro": "Diphasiastrum zeilleri var. ramistachyum, commonly known as the ramistachyum fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and slightly glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing clusters, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
