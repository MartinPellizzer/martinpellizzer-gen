    "intro": "Dracula inaequalis, commonly known as the Dragon's Blood Orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark red to purple petals and sepals, which resemble dried blood, giving it its dramatic common name. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that bloom during the dry season, often in clusters along its stems. Dracula inaequalis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich substrates. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
