It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial to full shade. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a blunt or rounded tip, giving it its common name. Dodecatheon obtusum is known for its early spring blooming period, often appearing before the leaves are fully developed."
