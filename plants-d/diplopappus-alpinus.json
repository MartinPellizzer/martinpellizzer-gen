    "intro": "Diplopappus alpinus, commonly known as the alpine diplopappus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its low stature and dense foliage. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pale yellow, and it produces achene fruits with pappus structures for wind dispersal. This species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems."
