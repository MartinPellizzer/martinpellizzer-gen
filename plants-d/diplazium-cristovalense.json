    "intro": "Diplazium cristovalense, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that often have a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across suitable habitats. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush green cover throughout the year."
