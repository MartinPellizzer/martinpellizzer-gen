    "intro": "Danthonia antarctica var. elata, commonly known as the Antarctic grass or Antarctic danthonia, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Antarctica and subantarctic regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are arranged in compact clusters, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, wind-swept environments and is adapted to withstand extreme cold and low light conditions. Due to its unique ecological role, it is an important component of the vegetation in polar and alpine ecosystems."
