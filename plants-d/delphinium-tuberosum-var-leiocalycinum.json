    "intro": "Delphinium tuberosum var. leiocalycinum, commonly known as the Alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
