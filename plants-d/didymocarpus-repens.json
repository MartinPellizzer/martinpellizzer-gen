    "intro": "Didymocarpus repens, commonly known as the creeping didymocarp, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, a typical feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture with prominent veins. Didymocarpus repens is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
