    "intro": "Damasonium californicum, commonly known as the California water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in early summer and are pollinated by insects. Damasonium californicum plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
