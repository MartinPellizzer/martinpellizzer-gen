This herbaceous plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its morphology includes a short, rhizomatous stem with two opposite, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, characteristic of many orchid species. It is noted for its unique adaptations to low-light conditions and its role in local ecosystems."
