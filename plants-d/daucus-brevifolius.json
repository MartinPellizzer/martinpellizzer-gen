    "intro": "Daucus brevifolius, commonly known as the short-leaved carrot, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, yellowish flowers. Native to the western United States, it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, round fruits that resemble those of the common carrot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
