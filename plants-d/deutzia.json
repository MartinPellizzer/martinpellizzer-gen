    "intro": "Deutzia, commonly known as shrub mallow, is a genus of about 30 species of flowering plants in the family Caprifoliaceae. These deciduous shrubs are native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and are characterized by their clusters of white, pink, or red flowers that bloom in spring. The foliage is typically dark green and glossy, with serrated leaves that provide ornamental value throughout the growing season. Deutzia plants prefer well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making them suitable for garden borders and woodland gardens. They are often used in landscaping for their attractive flowers and compact growth habit."
