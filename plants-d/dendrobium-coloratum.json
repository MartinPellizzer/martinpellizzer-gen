    "intro": "Dendrobium coloratum, commonly known as the golden butterfly orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often resembling butterflies in shape and color. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium coloratum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
