    "intro": "Delphinium somcheticum, commonly known as the Siberian larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its toxic properties."
