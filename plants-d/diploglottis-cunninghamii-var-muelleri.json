    "intro": "Diploglottis cunninghamii var. muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's diploglottis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface, and small, clustered white flowers.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
