    "intro": "Dicranacanthus stimulans, commonly known as the spurred holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Dicranacanthus stimulans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
