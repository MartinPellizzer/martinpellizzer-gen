    "intro": "Delphinium latilimbum, commonly known as the broad-leaved larkspur, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and its flowers are typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
