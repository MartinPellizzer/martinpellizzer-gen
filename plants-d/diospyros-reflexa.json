    "intro": "Diospyros reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green on top. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits resembling persimmons. Its fruit is edible, though some varieties may have astringent properties when unripe. Diospyros reflexa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
