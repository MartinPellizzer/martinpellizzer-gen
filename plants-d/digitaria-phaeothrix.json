    "intro": "Digitaria phaeothrix, commonly known as silverhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray blades and fine, hair-like structures along the leaf margins. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Digitaria phaeothrix is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor soil conditions."
