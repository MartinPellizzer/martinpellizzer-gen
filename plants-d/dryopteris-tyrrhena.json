    "intro": "Dryopteris tyrrhena, commonly known as the Tyrrhenian wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its robust, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland ecosystems."
