    "intro": "Dendrobium auyongii, commonly known as the Auyong orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight. Dendrobium auyongii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
