    "intro": "Decalobanthus boisianus var. sumatranus, commonly known as the Sumatran starling orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically a deep violet or purple color. The plant has a slender, erect stem with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, this species is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
