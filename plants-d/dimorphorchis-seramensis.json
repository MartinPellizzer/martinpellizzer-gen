    "intro": "Dimorphorchis seramensis, commonly known as the Seram orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the island of Seram in Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring two distinct types of flowers on the same inflorescence. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, where it thrives on the bark of trees or in rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually small, with intricate patterns of purple and white, and it blooms during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dimorphorchis seramensis is considered a vulnerable species."
