    "intro": "Diodia villosa, commonly known as hairy diodia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Diodia villosa is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and potential medicinal properties."
