    "intro": "Dianthus ichnusae subsp. ichnusae, commonly known as the mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, edible seeds that are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is commonly found in alpine and arctic regions. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, cold environments."
