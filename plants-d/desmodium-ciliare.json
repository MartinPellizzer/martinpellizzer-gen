    "intro": "Desmodium ciliare, commonly known as slender ticktrefoil, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with finely toothed margins and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with Rhizobium bacteria in its root nodules. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in ecological restoration projects."
