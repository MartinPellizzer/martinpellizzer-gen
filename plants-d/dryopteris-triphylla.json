    "intro": "Dryopteris triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, triangular-shaped fronds that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in woodland ecosystems."
