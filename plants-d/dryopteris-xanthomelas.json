    "intro": "Dryopteris xanthomelas, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive golden-yellow coloration on the underside of the leaves. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common trait among ferns. The golden shield fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
