    "intro": "Dolichos bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert's dolichos, is a climbing legume native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential ecological roles, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
