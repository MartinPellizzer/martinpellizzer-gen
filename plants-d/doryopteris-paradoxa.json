    "intro": "Doryopteris paradoxa, commonly known as the paradox fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound leaves that are often described as having a paradoxical appearance due to their unique arrangement. The fronds are typically bright green and can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a leathery texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. The plant's reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
