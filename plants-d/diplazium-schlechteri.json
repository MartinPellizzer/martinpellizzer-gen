    "intro": "Diplazium schlechteri, commonly known as the false button fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often form a compact rosette. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. Diplazium schlechteri thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
