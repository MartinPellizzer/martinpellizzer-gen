    "intro": "Dendrobium laterale, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of bright yellow flowers, which are often fragrant. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with stems that grow horizontally and produce new growth from the base. Its leaves are usually linear and arranged in two rows along the stem. Dendrobium laterale thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
