    "intro": "Dendrocalamus multiflosculus, commonly known as the multi-flowered bamboo, is a tall, clump-forming grass native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its robust, hollow stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and contribute to its rapid growth and clumping habit. This bamboo is often used in traditional construction and as a source of sustainable materials."
