    "intro": "Dryopteris coalescens, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that have a distinctive cinnamon-colored fiddlehead at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. The cinnamon fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
