    "intro": "Diplospora beccariana, commonly known as the beccarian dwarf fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a short rhizome with a rosette of closely spaced, lance-shaped fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in tropical rainforests."
