    "intro": "Dicella bracteosa var. minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered dicella, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has small, delicate flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations."
