    "intro": "Dischidia micholitzii, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is a trailing or climbing vine characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often borne in clusters. Its leaves are typically covered with a fine, velvety coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Dischidia micholitzii is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
