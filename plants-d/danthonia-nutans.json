    "intro": "Danthonia nutans, commonly known as the prostrate danthonia, is a grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense, fine-textured foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread and form extensive turf-like mats. Danthonia nutans is often found in grasslands and along coastal areas, where it contributes to soil stabilization and biodiversity."
