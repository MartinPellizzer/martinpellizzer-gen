    "intro": "Daphne axilliflora, commonly known as the rock daphne, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and its ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white during late winter to early spring. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
