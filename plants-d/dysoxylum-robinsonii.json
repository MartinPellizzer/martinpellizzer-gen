    "intro": "Dysoxylum robinsonii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows in lowland and hill forest areas, often reaching heights of up to 30 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
