    "intro": "Dendrobium cyrusianum, commonly known as the Ceylon orchid, is a species of orchid native to Sri Lanka. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Dendrobium cyrusianum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
