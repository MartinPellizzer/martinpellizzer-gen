    "intro": "Delphinium flavum var. deserti, commonly known as the desert larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
