    "intro": "Dryopteris loheriana, commonly known as the Loher's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are dark green and have a velvety texture, making it a distinctive and ornamental plant in horticulture."
