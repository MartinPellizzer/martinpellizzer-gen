    "intro": "Decaspermum fruticosum, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, which is toxic, has been used traditionally in some regions for medicinal purposes. The species is also valued for its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
