    "intro": "Delilia repens, commonly known as the creeping delilia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It features slender, hairy stems that spread along the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. Delilia repens is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
