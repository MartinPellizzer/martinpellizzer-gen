    "intro": "Darlingtonia brachyloba var. intermedia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hoodsnake plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that form a pitfall trap to capture prey. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique morphology allows it to efficiently trap and digest small insects. This variety is often cultivated for its striking appearance and ecological adaptations."
