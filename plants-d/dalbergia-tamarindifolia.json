    "intro": "Dalbergia tamarindifolia, commonly known as the African tamarind, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces long, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds surrounded by a fibrous, acidic pulp. It is often found in savannas and woodland areas, and it plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The plant is valued for its timber, which is used in furniture and musical instruments, as well as for its medicinal properties."
