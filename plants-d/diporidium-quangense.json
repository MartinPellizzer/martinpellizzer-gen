    "intro": "Diporidium quangense, commonly known as the Quang Province diporidium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
