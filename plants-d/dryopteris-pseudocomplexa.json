    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudocomplexa, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that remain green throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive holly-like appearance, giving it its common name."
