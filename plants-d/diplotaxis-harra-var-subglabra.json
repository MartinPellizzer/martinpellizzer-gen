    "intro": "Diplotaxis harra var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth harra, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant has a hairy stem, but the leaves are smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. It is adapted to thrive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and has ecological importance as a source of nectar for pollinators."
