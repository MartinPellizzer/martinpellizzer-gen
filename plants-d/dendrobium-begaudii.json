    "intro": "Dendrobium begaudii, commonly known as the Begaud's orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, typical of epiphytic species. Dendrobium begaudii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in cultivated settings."
