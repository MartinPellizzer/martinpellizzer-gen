    "intro": "Dryas octopetala var. glabrata, commonly known as the nakedleaf mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its basal rosette of simple, glabrous (hairless) leaves that are usually dark green and slightly succulent. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in a dense cluster at the end of each stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is distinguished from other forms of Dryas octopetala by its lack of pubescence on the leaves and its more compact growth habit."
