    "intro": "Dendrobium pubescens, commonly known as the hairy orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that often bear clusters of showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, adapting it to its natural habitat in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange with intricate patterns, and they bloom in late summer or early autumn. Dendrobium pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
