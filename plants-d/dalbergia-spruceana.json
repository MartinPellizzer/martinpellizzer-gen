    "intro": "Dalbergia spruceana, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood with a rich, aromatic scent. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules. Due to its high value for woodworking, it is often threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
