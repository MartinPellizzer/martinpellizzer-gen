    "intro": "Disperis breviloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved disperis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Its flowering period occurs during the wet season, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in some areas."
