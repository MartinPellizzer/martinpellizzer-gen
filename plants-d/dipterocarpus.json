    "intro": "Dipterocarpus, commonly known as the dipterocarp, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Dipterocarpaceae. These trees are predominantly found in the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, India, and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their large, often buttressed roots and their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Dipterocarps play a crucial role in tropical rainforests, providing habitat and contributing to the ecosystem's biodiversity. Their wood is highly valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making."
