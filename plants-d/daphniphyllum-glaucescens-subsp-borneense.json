It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by bright red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
