    "intro": "Daphniphyllum macropodum, commonly known as the large-leaf holly, is a evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in cooler climates."
