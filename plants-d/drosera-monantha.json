    "intro": "Drosera monantha, commonly known as the single-stem sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap insects. The plant's leaves are covered in tiny hair-like structures that secrete a mucilaginous substance to immobilize prey. It typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Drosera monantha is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its nutrients through insect consumption."
