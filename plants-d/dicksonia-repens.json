    "intro": "Dicksonia repens, commonly known as the running tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories, and is well adapted to the temperate climate of its native habitat. Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that contribute to the ecological structure of its environment. The fronds are dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in shape and size, a feature common among ferns."
