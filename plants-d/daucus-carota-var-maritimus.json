    "intro": "Daucus carota var. maritimus, commonly known as sea carrot, is a coastal plant adapted to salty and sandy environments. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dunes and along shorelines, where it helps stabilize sand and prevent erosion. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a bluish or silvery hue to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and white, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread along coastal regions."
