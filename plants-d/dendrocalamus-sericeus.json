It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that are covered in a silvery, powdery bloom, giving it its common name. The plant is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and utility in basket weaving. Its rhizomes are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Dendrocalamus sericeus thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and wetlands."
