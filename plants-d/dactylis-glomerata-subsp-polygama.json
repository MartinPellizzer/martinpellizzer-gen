    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata subsp. polygama, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and tufted inflorescences that produce small, pale blue or green flowers. The plant is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
