    "intro": "Diplazium plantagineum var. serratum, commonly known as the serrated rock fern, is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is typically found in rocky or forested areas. The fronds are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets that give the plant its common name. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various soil conditions."
