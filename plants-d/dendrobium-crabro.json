    "intro": "Dendrobium crabro, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender stems that can reach up to several feet in length. Its flowers are striking, with a unique shape resembling a bee, and are typically yellow or green with purple or brown markings. Dendrobium crabro thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
