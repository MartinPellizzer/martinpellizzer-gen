    "intro": "Dalbergia dongnaiensis, commonly known as the Dong Nai rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam, and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters, with compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a component of tropical forest ecosystems and its potential for sustainable forestry and conservation efforts."
