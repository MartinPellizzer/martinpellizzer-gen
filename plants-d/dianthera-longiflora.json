    "intro": "Dianthera longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered dianthera, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. This perennial herb features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are pinnately divided with a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The flowers are small, white to pale pink, and clustered in compound umbels, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, it is often found in grasslands and woodland edges."
