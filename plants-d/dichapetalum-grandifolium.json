    "intro": "Dichapetalum grandifolium, commonly known as the giant waterleaf, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter, often with a waxy texture and a distinct central vein. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on long, slender peduncles. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and wetlands. Dichapetalum grandifolium is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and thrive in saturated soil conditions."
