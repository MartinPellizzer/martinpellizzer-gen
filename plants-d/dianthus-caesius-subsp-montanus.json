    "intro": "Dianthus caesius subsp. montanus, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five petals and numerous stamens, and it produces capsule fruits containing small, dry seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
