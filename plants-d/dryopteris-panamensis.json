    "intro": "Dryopteris panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Central America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread and establish in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive, elegant appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It thrives in temperate to tropical climates and requires high humidity and partial to full shade for optimal growth."
