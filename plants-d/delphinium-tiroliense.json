    "intro": "Delphinium tiroliense, commonly known as the Austrian larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Alps of Central Europe. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that bear whorled clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are alternate along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in mountainous or alpine regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is toxic to livestock and humans."
