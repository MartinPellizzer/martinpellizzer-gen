It belongs to the Ebenaceae family, which includes other persimmon species and ebony trees. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are typically clustered in panicles, and the fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns orange-red when mature. Diospyros sororia is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
