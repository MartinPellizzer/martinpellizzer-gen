    "intro": "Drymaria lyropetala, commonly known as the lyreleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. The species is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
