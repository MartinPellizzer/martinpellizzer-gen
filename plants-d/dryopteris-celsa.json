    "intro": "Dryopteris celsa, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are typically biennial, with the fertile fronds developing in the second year and producing spores on the undersides."
