    "intro": "Diplazium phaeolepis, commonly known as the black-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive blackish stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Diplazium phaeolepis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
