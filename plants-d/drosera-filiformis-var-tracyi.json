    "intro": "Drosera filiformis var. tracyi, commonly known as the Tracy's Sundew, is a variant of the common sundew species native to Australia. It is a small, carnivorous plant that thrives in wet, boggy environments, using its sticky, glandular leaves to trap and digest insects. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral touch to its appearance. Its leaves are long and thin, often curling around captured prey to enhance digestion. This variety is prized by collectors for its unique appearance and ecological adaptability."
