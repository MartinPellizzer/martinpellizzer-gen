It is characterized by its distinctive, globular spore capsules that develop at the tips of its fertile fronds. The plant exhibits a tall, tree-like structure with a single trunk and compound leaves that are often feather-shaped. Its spores are released in large quantities, contributing to its reproductive strategy in moist, shaded environments. This plant is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils."
