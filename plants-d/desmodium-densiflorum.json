    "intro": "Desmodium densiflorum, commonly known as the denseflower burr legume, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant produces hairy, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
