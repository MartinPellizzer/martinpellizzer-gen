    "intro": "Dendrophthoe kramatensis, commonly known as the Kramatensis ghost flower, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Rhamnaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Malaysia. This plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, often attaching itself to trees such as Ficus species. Its unique appearance includes translucent, thread-like structures that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant is of interest to botanists due to its specialized parasitic lifestyle and ecological role in its native habitat."
