It typically grows along stream banks and moist woodlands, thriving in well-drained to moist soils. The plant features opposite, oval to elliptical leaves that are dark green and often have a slightly hairy texture. Its showy, tubular flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late spring to early summer. The berries that follow are red or yellow and serve as a food source for various birds and small mammals."
