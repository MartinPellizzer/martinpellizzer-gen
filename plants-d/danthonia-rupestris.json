    "intro": "Danthonia rupestris, commonly known as the rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal and alpine environments. Danthonia rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in marginal habitats."
