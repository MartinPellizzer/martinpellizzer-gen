    "intro": "Dendrobium sarcodes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, thin stems covered in a thick, white, waxy coating that gives it its common name. Its flowers are pale green to white, with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly shapes, adding to its ethereal appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Dendrobium sarcodes is highly sought after in the horticultural trade."
