    "intro": "Dryopteris strigosissima, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth. The spores are released from sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
