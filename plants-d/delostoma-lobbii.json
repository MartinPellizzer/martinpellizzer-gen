    "intro": "Delostoma lobbii, commonly known as the African rain lichen, is a unique lichen species that thrives in humid, tropical environments. It belongs to the family Teloschistaceae and is characterized by its intricate thallus structure, which is typically crustose or foliose. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner, enabling it to survive in nutrient-poor substrates. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in rainforests across Africa. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Delostoma lobbii is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
