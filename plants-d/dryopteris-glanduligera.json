    "intro": "Dryopteris glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered with small, glandular dots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Dryopteris glanduligera is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
