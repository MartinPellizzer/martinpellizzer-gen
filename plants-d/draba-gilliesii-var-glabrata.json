    "intro": "Draba gilliesii var. glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact rosette of hairy, basal leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
