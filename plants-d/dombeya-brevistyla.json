    "intro": "Dombeya brevistyla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dombeya, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Africa. It is characterized by its clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. Its stems are usually smooth and can become woody with age, while its root system is fibrous and well-developed. Dombeya brevistyla is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
