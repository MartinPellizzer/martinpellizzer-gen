    "intro": "Dimerostemma pseudosilphioides, commonly known as the false silphioid, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its unique, spurred petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces pods that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
