    "intro": "Dendromyza apiculata, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Dendromyza apiculata produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
