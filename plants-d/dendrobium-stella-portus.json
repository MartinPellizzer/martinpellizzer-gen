    "intro": "Dendrobium stella-portus, commonly known as the star-portus orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying a mix of white, yellow, and green tones. Dendrobium stella-portus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
