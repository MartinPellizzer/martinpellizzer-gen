    "intro": "Dryopteris lugubriformis, commonly known as the sad-shaped wood fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble a weeping willow. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense clumps, supporting the growth of its feathery foliage. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
