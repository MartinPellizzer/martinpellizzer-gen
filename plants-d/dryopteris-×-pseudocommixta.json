    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 pseudocommixta, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a distinctive holly-like appearance due to its serrated, spiny leaflets. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal rather than vegetative propagation. This fern is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
