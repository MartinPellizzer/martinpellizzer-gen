    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis subsp. traunsteinerioides, commonly known as the Traunsteiner's lady's-tongue, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, upright stem and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant prefers moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or heathland habitats. Its flowers are usually pink or purple with a distinctive lip that resembles a tongue, giving it its common name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
