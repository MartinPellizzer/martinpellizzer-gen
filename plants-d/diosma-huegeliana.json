It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically lanceolate and covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
