    "intro": "Diphasium chamaecyparissus, commonly known as the rock pine or false cypress, is a shrub-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features needle-like leaves that are closely packed, giving it a dense, pine-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its cones are woody and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
