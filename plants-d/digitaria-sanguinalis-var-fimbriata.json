It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and distinctive, hairy ligules that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in a variety of habitats, including roadsides, fields, and disturbed areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains. This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and hardiness."
