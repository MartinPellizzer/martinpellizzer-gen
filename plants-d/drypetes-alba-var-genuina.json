It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often giving it a striking appearance. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
