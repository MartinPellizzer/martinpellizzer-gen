    "intro": "Dicranopteris longipes, commonly known as the long-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizome that is creeping and produces both roots and fertile shoots. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds. Dicranopteris longipes is typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies."
