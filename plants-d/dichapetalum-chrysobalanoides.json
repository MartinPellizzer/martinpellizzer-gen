It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in dense clusters during the dry season. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate in appearance. It grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, making it an important species for avian biodiversity."
