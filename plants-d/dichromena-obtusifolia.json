It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with showy, pale yellow petals that attract pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or swampy areas. Dichromena obtusifolia is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
