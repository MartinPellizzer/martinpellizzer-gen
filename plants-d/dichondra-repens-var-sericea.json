It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature. This variety is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate drought conditions."
