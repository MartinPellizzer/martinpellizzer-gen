    "intro": "Desmodium radiatum, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps in nitrogen fixation, making it useful in agricultural settings. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Desmodium radiatum is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to suppress weeds and improve soil fertility."
