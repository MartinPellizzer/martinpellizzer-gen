    "intro": "Diotis maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its saline environment. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along rocky shores. Its flowers are typically arranged in a compact, spiky inflorescence, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Diotis maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
