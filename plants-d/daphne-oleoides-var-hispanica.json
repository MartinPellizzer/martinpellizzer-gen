The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red during late winter to early spring. Its ornamental value comes from its showy blooms and distinctive foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
