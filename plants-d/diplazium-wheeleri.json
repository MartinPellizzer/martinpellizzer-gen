    "intro": "Diplazium wheeleri, commonly known as the Wheeler's snake fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped fronds with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Diplazium wheeleri typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its unique morphology and ecological role."
