    "intro": "Dimorphanthera seramica, commonly known as the Seram orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Seram in Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring two distinct types of flowers on the same inflorescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it thrives on decaying organic matter. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dimorphanthera seramica is considered a conservation concern."
