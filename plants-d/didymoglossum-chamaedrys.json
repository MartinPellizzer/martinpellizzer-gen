    "intro": "Didymoglossum chamaedrys, commonly known as the creeping hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green hue due to the presence of anthocyanins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
