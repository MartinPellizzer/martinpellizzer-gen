    "intro": "Delphinium schlagintweitii, commonly known as the Schlagintweit larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, adorned with large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
