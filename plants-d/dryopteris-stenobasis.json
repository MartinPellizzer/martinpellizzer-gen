    "intro": "Dryopteris stenobasis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The narrow-leaf wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in forest ecosystems."
