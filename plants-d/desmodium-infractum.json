    "intro": "Desmodium infractum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf desmodium, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Americas. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant typically features trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through mechanical means. Desmodium infractum is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling."
