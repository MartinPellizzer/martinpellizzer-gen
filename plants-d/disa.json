    "intro": "Disa, commonly known as the rain orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their striking, often brightly colored flowers. Disa species typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce spikes of showy, tubular flowers. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, and require specific environmental conditions to thrive. The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are cultivated for their ornamental value."
