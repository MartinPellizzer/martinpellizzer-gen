    "intro": "Daucus carota convar. longus, commonly known as the wild carrot or Queen Anne's lace, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and an umbel of small, white flowers with a single red or purple flower in the center. The plant produces a taproot that is typically thin and cylindrical, though it can be slightly swollen in some varieties. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields. The species is known for its aromatic seeds and has been used historically in both culinary and medicinal applications."
