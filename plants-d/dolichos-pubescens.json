It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm climate for optimal growth. Dolichos pubescens is valued both for its nutritional seeds and its role in soil enrichment through nitrogen fixation."
