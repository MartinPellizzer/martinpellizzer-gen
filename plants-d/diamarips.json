    "intro": "Diamarips, commonly known as the \"butterfly orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often brightly colored flowers that resemble butterflies, hence their common name. Diamarips species are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or other structures without being parasitic. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Their growth requires high humidity, indirect light, and well-draining soil to thrive."
