    "intro": "Dyckia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dyckia, is a species of flowering plant in the bromeliad family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom. The plant produces striking, bottle-shaped inflorescences that bear small, white or pink flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Dyckia stenophylla is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
