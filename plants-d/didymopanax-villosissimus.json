    "intro": "Didymopanax villosissimus, commonly known as the hairy sycamore, is a large tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, lowland areas and is often found in rainforests. The tree is valued for its hard, heavy wood and has traditional uses in some indigenous communities."
