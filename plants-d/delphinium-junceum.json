    "intro": "Delphinium junceum, commonly known as the slender larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are composed of five petals, with the upper petal forming a distinctive hood-like structure. Delphinium junceum is known for its ornamental value in gardens but is also toxic to livestock and humans due to its alkaloid content."
