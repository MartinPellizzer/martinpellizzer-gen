    "intro": "Delphinium umbraculorum, commonly known as the shade delphinium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces striking spikes of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Delphinium umbraculorum prefers partial to full shade and well-drained, fertile soil, making it a valuable addition to woodland gardens."
