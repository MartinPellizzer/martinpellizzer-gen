    "intro": "Dianthus asperulus, commonly known as the prickly campion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features slender, branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are covered in fine, stiff hairs. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Dianthus asperulus is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
