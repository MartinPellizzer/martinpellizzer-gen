    "intro": "Draba borealis, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a small flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its simple, basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Draba borealis thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its short stature and compact growth form help it survive in harsh, windy environments."
