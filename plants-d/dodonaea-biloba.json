    "intro": "Dodonaea biloba, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters, and its leaves are typically small and velvety to the touch. The plant is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. It has been introduced to other regions, including parts of the United States, where it can become invasive. Dodonaea biloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for native wildlife."
