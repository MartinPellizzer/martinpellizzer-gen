    "intro": "Dianella nemorosa f. congesta, commonly known as the dense form of the common flax lily, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, low-growing mat, often reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers during the summer months, which are followed by dark blue, spherical berries. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in coastal and forested areas. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and ability to form a dense ground cover."
