    "intro": "Dracaena rugosifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved dracaena, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in small, raised bumps, giving them a textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Dracaena rugosifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
