    "intro": "Dalea maritima, commonly known as sea blush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Dalea maritima is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a hardy coastal plant."
