    "intro": "Davallia pellucida, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
