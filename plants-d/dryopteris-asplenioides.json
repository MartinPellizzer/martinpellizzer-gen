    "intro": "Dryopteris asplenioides, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium. Dryopteris asplenioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
