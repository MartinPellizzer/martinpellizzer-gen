    "intro": "Dracophyllum ramosum, commonly known as the silver-leaved dracophyllum, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine silvery or whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red in color, which bloom in spring. Dracophyllum ramosum is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
