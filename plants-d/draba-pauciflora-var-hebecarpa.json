    "intro": "Draba pauciflora var. hebecarpa, commonly known as the slender-flowered rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically has basal rosettes of linear, glaucous leaves and produces small white or pale yellow flowers in spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
