    "intro": "Dactylorchis latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf twayblade, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring a slender, grass-like stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, often blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in several states."
