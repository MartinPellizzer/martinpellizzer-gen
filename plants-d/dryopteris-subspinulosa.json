    "intro": "Dryopteris subspinulosa, commonly known as the spinulose wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, often branched fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The fronds are covered with small, spinelike protuberances, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to establish strong, long-lived colonies."
