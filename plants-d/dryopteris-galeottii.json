    "intro": "Dryopteris galeottii, commonly known as the Galeotti's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing fiddleheads in early spring, which are coiled and tightly wrapped. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies over time."
