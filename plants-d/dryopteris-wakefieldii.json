    "intro": "Dryopteris wakefieldii, commonly known as the Wakefield's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a dark green color and a serrated edge. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
