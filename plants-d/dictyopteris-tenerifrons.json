    "intro": "Dictyopteris tenerifrons, commonly known as the Canary Islands kelp, is a species of brown algae belonging to the family Dictyopteridaceae. It is characterized by its flattened, blade-like thallus with a distinct midrib and a network of fine veins. The plant typically grows in shallow coastal waters, often attached to rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures, including both sperm and egg-producing organs, are embedded within the thallus. The species is native to the Canary Islands and is an important component of the marine ecosystem in that region."
