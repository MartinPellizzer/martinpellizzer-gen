    "intro": "Droogmansia pteropus var. pteropus, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, feather-like fronds that radiate from a central stem, creating a star-shaped appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are typically a vibrant green, with some varieties displaying a golden hue on the underside. This ornamental plant is often used in hanging baskets or as a decorative element in tropical gardens."
