    "intro": "Desmodium subrosum, commonly known as the purple desmodium, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers, which range in color from white to purple, are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Desmodium subrosum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
