    "intro": "Diplazium fructuosum, commonly known as the fruit-bearing shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are often divided into segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium fructuosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
