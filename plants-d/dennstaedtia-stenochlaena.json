    "intro": "Dennstaedtia stenochlaena, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks, and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
