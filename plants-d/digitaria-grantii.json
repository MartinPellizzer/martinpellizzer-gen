It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is a characteristic feature of the grass family. Digitaria grantii is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
