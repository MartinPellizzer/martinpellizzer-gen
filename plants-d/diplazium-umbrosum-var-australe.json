    "intro": "Diplazium umbrosum var. australe, commonly known as the Australian mountain fern, is a perennial fern native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understoreys and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
