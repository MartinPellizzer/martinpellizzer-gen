    "intro": "Dryopteris scottii, commonly known as the Scottish wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, upright growth habit. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are typically covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy structures called indusia. Dryopteris scottii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, feathery appearance."
