    "intro": "Delphinium polycladon, commonly known as the Alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in late summer, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are compound, with lance-shaped leaflets that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. Delphinium polycladon is adapted to cold, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
