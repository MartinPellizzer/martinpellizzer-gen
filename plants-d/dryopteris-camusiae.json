    "intro": "Dryopteris camusiae, commonly known as the Camusia wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a compact, upright form. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the undersides of its leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialty gardens."
