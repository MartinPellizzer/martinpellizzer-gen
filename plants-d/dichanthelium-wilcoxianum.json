    "intro": "Dichanthelium wilcoxianum, commonly known as Wilcox's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
