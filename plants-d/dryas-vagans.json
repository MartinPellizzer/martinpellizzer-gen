    "intro": "Dryas vagans, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue, often appearing in late summer. Its leaves are typically silver-gray due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. Dryas vagans is adapted to rocky and alpine soils, thriving in harsh conditions where few other plants can survive."
