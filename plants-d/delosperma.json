    "intro": "Delosperma, commonly known as ice plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae. These succulent plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their fleshy, water-storing leaves and vibrant, daisy-like flowers. They thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making them well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Delosperma species are typically low-growing, with some varieties forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Their ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions makes them popular choices for drought-resistant landscaping."
