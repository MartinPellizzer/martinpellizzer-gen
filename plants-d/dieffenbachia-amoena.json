    "intro": "Dieffenbachia amoena, commonly known as the Leopard Plant, is a tropical perennial plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with striking white or yellow markings. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, which includes other ornamental plants like peace lilies and calla lilies. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dieffenbachia amoena is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
