    "intro": "Drynaria tricuspis, commonly known as the three-lobed fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
