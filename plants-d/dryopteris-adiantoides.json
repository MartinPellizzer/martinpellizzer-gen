    "intro": "Dryopteris adiantoides, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with slender, wiry stems that produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Its leaves are typically bright green, with a distinctive, feathery appearance, and the spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to shady, moist environments."
