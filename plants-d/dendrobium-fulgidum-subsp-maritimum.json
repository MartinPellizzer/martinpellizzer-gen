    "intro": "Dendrobium fulgidum subsp. maritimum, commonly known as the coastal dendrobium, is a terrestrial orchid native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, sometimes branched pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow to orange, often with a red or purple lip. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. This subspecies is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and periodic drought conditions."
