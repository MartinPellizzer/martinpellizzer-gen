    "intro": "Dendrobium centrale, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. The plant produces striking yellow and green flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its tropical environment. Dendrobium centrale is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
