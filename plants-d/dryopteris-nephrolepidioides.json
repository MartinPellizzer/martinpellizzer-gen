    "intro": "Dryopteris nephrolepidioides, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant prefers well-drained, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, woodland settings."
