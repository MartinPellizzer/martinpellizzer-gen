    "intro": "Danthoniopsis anomala, commonly known as the narrowleaf muirgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length, with a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
