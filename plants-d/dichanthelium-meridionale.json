It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle with small, spikelet-like flowers, which are characteristic of the grass family.
