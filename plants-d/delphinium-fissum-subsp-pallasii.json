    "intro": "Delphinium fissum subsp. pallasii, commonly known as Pallas's larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in racemose inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
