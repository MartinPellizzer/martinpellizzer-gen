    "intro": "Dendrobium phalaenopsis var. rothschildianum, commonly known as the Rothschild's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. The plant features long, pendant inflorescences with large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink with intricate patterns. It requires bright, indirect light and consistent humidity to thrive. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated for both indoor and greenhouse settings."
