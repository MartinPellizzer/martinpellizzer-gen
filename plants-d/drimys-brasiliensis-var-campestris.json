    "intro": "Drimys brasiliensis var. campestris, commonly known as the Brazilian wintergreen, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that emit a strong, spicy scent when crushed. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by dark blue, oval berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical regions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for its potential medicinal properties."
