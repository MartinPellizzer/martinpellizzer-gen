    "intro": "Digitaria macractinia subsp. muelleriana, commonly known as Mueller's digitaria, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the nodes, with small, pale brown flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
