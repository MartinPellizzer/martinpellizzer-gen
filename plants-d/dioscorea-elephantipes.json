It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by heart-shaped, greenish-white fruits. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a rough texture. The rhizomes are used as a food source and have been traditionally valued for their nutritional content."
