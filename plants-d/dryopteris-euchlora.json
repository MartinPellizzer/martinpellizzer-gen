    "intro": "Dryopteris euchlora, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It thrives in rocky, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with moist, well-drained soil. The plant has fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is valued for its hardy nature and ability to add texture and color to shaded garden spaces."
