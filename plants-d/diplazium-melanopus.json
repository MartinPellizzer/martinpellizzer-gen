    "intro": "Diplazium melanopus, commonly known as the black-stemmed fork fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, forked fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced in sori located on the undersides of the fronds. Diplazium melanopus thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories."
