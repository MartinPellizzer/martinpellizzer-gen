    "intro": "Dendrobium trilamellatum, commonly known as the three-leaf lip, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that bear numerous ovate, glossy green leaves. The plant produces pendant inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in horticulture but is also threatened by habitat loss."
