    "intro": "Diapedium frondosum, commonly known as the broadleaf diapedium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It is native to certain regions of South America and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
