    "intro": "Diplolepis viridis, commonly known as the green fern, is a perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two levels of smaller leaflets, giving it a lush, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for wildlife."
