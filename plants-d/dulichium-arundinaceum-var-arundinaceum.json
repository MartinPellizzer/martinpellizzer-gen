    "intro": "Dulichium arundinaceum var. arundinaceum, commonly known as common bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical, grass-like stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
