    "intro": "Dryopteris miqueliana var. fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed wood fern, is a variant of the Miquel's wood fern. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments with a distinctive fringed appearance along the edges. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically dark green and can grow up to 1 meter in length, making it a striking addition to woodland gardens."
