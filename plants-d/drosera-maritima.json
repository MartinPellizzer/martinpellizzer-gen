    "intro": "Drosera maritima, commonly known as the coastal sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to coastal regions of Europe, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic, and sandy soils, often in salt marshes or coastal heathlands. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or red, and it blooms during the summer months. Drosera maritima is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, sunny environments and is well adapted to coastal conditions."
