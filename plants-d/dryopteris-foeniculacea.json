    "intro": "Dryopteris foeniculacea, commonly known as the carrot fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble the leaves of a carrot. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread to form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
