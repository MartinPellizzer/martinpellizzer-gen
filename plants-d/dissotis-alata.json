    "intro": "Dissotis alata, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features succulent, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed sites. Due to its invasive tendencies in some areas, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural settings."
