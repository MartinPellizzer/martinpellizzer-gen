    "intro": "Desmophyla, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their succulent, often hairy leaves and showy, yellowish or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia. They are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, southern Europe, and the Middle East. Desmophyla species are typically low-growing, mat-forming plants that thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Their ability to store water in their thick leaves makes them well adapted to dry environments."
