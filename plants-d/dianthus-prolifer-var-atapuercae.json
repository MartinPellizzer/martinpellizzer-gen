It features showy, double or semi-double flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with dense foliage and is well-suited for rock gardens or borders. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological landscapes."
