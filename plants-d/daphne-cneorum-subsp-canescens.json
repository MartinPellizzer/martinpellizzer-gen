    "intro": "Daphne cneorum subsp. canescens, commonly known as the silver daphne, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, fragrant flowers that range from white to pink, often appearing in early spring. The plant has dense, silvery-gray foliage that provides ornamental value throughout the year. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
