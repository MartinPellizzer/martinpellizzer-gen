    "intro": "Dicranopteris, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often finely divided fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. They are commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Dicranopteris species are known for their ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, often growing along the edges of water bodies. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
