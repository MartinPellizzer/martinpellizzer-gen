    "intro": "Dendrobium ceraula, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. Dendrobium ceraula is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its use in traditional medicine."
