    "intro": "Dendrocalamus textilis, commonly known as the bamboo grass or giant bamboo, is a species of grass belonging to the Poaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 15 meters in height, with a hollow, segmented structure. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Dendrocalamus textilis is widely cultivated for its strong, flexible stalks, which are used in construction, papermaking, and as a source of fiber."
