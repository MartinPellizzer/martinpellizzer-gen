    "intro": "Draba paishanensis, commonly known as the Paishan dwarf cabbage, is a flowering plant native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and rosette-forming leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it adapts to cold and arid conditions. It is a perennial species with a short growth cycle, flowering in late spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its region."
