    "intro": "Delphinium dissectum, commonly known as the dissected larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of showy blue to purple flowers. The leaves are deeply lobed and dissected, giving the plant its common name, and are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and pets."
