    "intro": "Dalbergia longepedunculata, commonly known as the African bloodwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several flat, winged seeds, which aid in wind dispersal. The tree is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in traditional medicine."
