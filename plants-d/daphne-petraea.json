    "intro": "Daphne petraea, commonly known as the rock daphne, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and lilac, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Daphne petraea is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
