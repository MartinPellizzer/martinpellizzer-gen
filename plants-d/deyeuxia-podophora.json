    "intro": "Deyeuxia podophora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marsh environments. It typically grows in shallow water or saturated soils, often forming dense stands that contribute to habitat structure. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow, flat, and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered in panicles, typical of the Poaceae family. Deyeuxia podophora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
