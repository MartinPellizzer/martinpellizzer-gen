    "intro": "Davallia virens, commonly known as the \"maidenhair fern,\" is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Davallia virens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and low maintenance requirements."
