    "intro": "Declieuxia cacuminis var. cacuminis, commonly known as the velvetleaf plant, is a member of the grass family (Poaceae). It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It produces small, clustered flower heads that are often inconspicuous compared to its foliage. This variant is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique leaf texture."
