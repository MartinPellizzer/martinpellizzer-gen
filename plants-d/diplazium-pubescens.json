    "intro": "Diplazium pubescens, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
