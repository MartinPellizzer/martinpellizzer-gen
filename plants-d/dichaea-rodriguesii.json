    "intro": "Dichaea rodriguesii, commonly known as Rodrigues's bromeliad, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
