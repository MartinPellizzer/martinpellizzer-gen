    "intro": "Dryopteris setosa, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Dryopteris setosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
