    "intro": "Deschampsia komandorensis, commonly known as Komandorensis grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of the Commander Islands in the Bering Sea. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh maritime climate characterized by strong winds and salt spray. The plant has slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endemic species of the region."
