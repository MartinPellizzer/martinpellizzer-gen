    "intro": "Decamerium brachycerum, commonly known as the short-capped decamerium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
