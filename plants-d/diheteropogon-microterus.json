    "intro": "Diheteropogon microterus, commonly known as the small-fruit bulrush, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic environment. Diheteropogon microterus plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for wetland wildlife."
