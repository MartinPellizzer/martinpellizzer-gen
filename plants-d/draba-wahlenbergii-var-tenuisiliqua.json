    "intro": "Draba wahlenbergii var. tenuisiliqua, commonly known as the slenderleaf whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It has basal leaves that are narrow and linear, and its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in some regions."
