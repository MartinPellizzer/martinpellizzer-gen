    "intro": "Delphinium peregrinum subsp. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf larkspur, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
