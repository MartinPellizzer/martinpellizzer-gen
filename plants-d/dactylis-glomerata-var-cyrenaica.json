It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, cylindrical spikelets that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
