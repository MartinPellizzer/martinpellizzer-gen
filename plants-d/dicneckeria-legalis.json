    "intro": "Dicneckeria legalis, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a rare tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, golden hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and private collections. Due to habitat loss, Dicneckeria legalis is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
