    "intro": "Draba ammophila, commonly known as the sand draba, is a small flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its simple, basal leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes or along shorelines. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with a short growth cycle to avoid extreme temperatures. Draba ammophila plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is an indicator species for coastal and semi-arid habitats."
