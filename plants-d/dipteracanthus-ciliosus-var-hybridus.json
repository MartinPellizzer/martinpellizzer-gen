    "intro": "Dipteracanthus ciliosus var. hybridus, commonly known as the hybrid velvetleaf, is a variant of the velvetleaf species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow in color. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to hybridize with other related species, it is considered a potential invasive plant in some areas."
