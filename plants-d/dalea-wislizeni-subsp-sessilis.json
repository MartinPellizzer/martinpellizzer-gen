    "intro": "Dalea wislizeni subsp. sessilis, commonly known as the slender prairie clover, is a perennial herb native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies sessilis differs from the typical Dalea wislizeni by having shorter, sessile (attached at the base) leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting native pollinators."
