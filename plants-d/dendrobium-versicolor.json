    "intro": "Dendrobium versicolor, commonly known as the variable orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically showy, with a wide range of colors and shapes, making it a popular choice for horticultural enthusiasts. Dendrobium versicolor is known for its ability to bloom multiple times a year under proper care."
