    "intro": "Dendrobium obscure-auriculatum, commonly known as the obscure-auriculate dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) lip that gives it its common name. This orchid is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
