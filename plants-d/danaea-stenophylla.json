    "intro": "Danaea stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf danaea, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae, which includes plants known for their showy inflorescences and often aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant features lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, clustered flowers with vibrant colors, often in shades of red or orange. Danaea stenophylla thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along streams. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
