    "intro": "Doronicum glaciale subsp. calcareum, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to alpine regions of Europe. It features showy, yellow flowers with five petals and a distinctive yellow center, blooming in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight in its harsh habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions."
