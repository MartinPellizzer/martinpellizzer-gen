    "intro": "Dracaena vivicans, commonly known as the flame plant or fire plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features striking, often red or orange-tipped leaves that give it its dramatic appearance. The plant has a woody stem with a swollen base, and its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Dracaena vivicans is well-suited for dry environments and requires minimal water once established."
