    "intro": "Digitaria rigida, commonly known as rigid grass or rigid fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warm temperate and tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its stiff, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is both a common weed and a valuable forage plant in some regions."
