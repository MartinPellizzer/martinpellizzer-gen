    "intro": "Drakaea lucida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the south-eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its striking, pale green to yellowish flowers that resemble a ghostly face, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on the trunks or branches of eucalyptus trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom during the late winter to early spring, and it relies on specific fungal partners for successful seed germination. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Drakaea lucida is considered a vulnerable species."
