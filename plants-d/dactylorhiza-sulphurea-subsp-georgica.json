It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has a single, erect stem that bears several showy, yellowish-orange flowers. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
