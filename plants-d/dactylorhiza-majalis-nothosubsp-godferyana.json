    "intro": "[WRONG START] Dactylorhiza majalis nothosubsp. godferyiana, commonly known as the Godfery's marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the wetlands of northern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in peat bogs and damp meadows, thriving in acidic, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of small, elongated flowers. This nothosubspecies is a result of natural hybridization between Dactylorhiza majalis and Dactylorhiza lapponica."
