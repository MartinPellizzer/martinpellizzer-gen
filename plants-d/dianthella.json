    "intro": "Dianthella, commonly known as the fairy bells, is a genus of flowering plants native to Australia. These plants are characterized by their striking, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including pink, white, and purple. Dianthella species typically grow in sandy or rocky soils and are often found in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while the stems are often hairy. They are popular in gardens for their ornamental value and are also important in ecological studies due to their role in supporting local wildlife."
