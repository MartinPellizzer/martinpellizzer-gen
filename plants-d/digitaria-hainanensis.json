    "intro": "Digitaria hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan digitaria, is a grass species native to China, specifically the Hainan Island. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
