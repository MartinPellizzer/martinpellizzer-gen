    "intro": "Dicksonia delicata, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its feathery, light green fronds that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant has a tall, slender trunk covered in a thick layer of persistent, fibrous roots. Its fronds are bi-directionally arranged, with the youngest leaves at the top and older ones spiraling downward. Dicksonia delicata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and forested areas."
