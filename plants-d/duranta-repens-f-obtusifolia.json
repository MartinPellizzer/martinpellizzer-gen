    "intro": "Duranta repens f. obtusifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf duranta, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It features oval, glossy, dark green leaves that are broader and more rounded than those of the typical Duranta repens, giving it a lush, dense appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that transition from white to yellow as they mature, often followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well-suited for container gardening or as a landscape accent. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and seasonal flowering, making it a popular choice in tropical and subtropical gardens."
