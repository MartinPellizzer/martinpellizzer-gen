    "intro": "Deparia confusa, commonly known as the broad fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often lobed fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Deparia confusa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
