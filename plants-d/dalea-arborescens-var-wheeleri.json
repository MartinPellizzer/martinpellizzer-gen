    "intro": "Dalea arborescens var. wheeleri, commonly known as Wheeler's tree clover, is a shrub-like perennial native to the southwestern United States. It features woody stems that grow upright, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
