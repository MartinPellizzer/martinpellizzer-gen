    "intro": "Dendrobium ostrinoglossum, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, often with yellow or orange hues, that bloom in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in moisture retention. Dendrobium ostrinoglossum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
