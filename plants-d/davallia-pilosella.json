    "intro": "Davallia pilosella, commonly known as the hairy Davallia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, clumping growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that have a distinctive hairy texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
