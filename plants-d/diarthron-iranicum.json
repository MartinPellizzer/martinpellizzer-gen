It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing at high altitudes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
