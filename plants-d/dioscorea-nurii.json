    "intro": "Dioscorea nurii, commonly known as the Chinese yam, is a perennial vine belonging to the family Dioscoreaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant produces tuberous roots that are rich in starch and have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. Its leaves are heart-shaped and alternate along the stems, while its flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Dioscorea nurii is valued not only for its medicinal properties but also for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
