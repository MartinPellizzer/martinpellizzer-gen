    "intro": "Desmodium tenellum, commonly known as smallleaf burr legume, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are small and often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by hairy, pod-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. Desmodium tenellum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
