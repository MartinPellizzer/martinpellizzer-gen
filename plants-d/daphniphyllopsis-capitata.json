    "intro": "Daphniphyllopsis capitata, commonly known as the helmet fern, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Daphniophyllopsidaceae. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped fronds that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The plant exhibits a primitive structure with a short, stout rhizome and delicate, spirally arranged leaves. It is primarily found in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Daphniphyllopsis capitata is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
