    "intro": "Descurainia serrata, commonly known as wild radish, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a branched stem that is often hairy, with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant has been used in traditional medicine and is also considered a weed in agricultural settings."
