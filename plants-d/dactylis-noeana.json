    "intro": "Dactylis noeana, commonly known as the narrow-leafed trefoil, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Dactylis noeana is well adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It is valued for its forage quality and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
