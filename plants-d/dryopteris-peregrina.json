    "intro": "Dryopteris peregrina, commonly known as the wandering fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. The plant's unique appearance and ecological adaptability make it a notable species in botanical studies."
