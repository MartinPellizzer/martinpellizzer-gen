    "intro": "Daucus maritimus f. pseudogummifer, commonly known as the coastal carrot, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to maritime environments. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas, often in regions with high salt exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
