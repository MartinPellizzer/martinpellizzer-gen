    "intro": "Dryandra stuposa, commonly known as the King's daisy, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the south-west of Western Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded habit and showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are arranged in flat-topped clusters, and it is well adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its natural habitat. Dryandra stuposa is a popular ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
