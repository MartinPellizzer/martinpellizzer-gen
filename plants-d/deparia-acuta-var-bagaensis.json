    "intro": "Deparia acuta var. bagaensis, commonly known as the Bagaensis water fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed water fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often floating on the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation. The species is valued in aquatic horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in water ecosystems."
