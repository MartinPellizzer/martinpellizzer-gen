    "intro": "Dendrocoryne tetragonum, commonly known as the diamond tree, is a unique plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, diamond-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by elongated, woody fruits. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Dendrocoryne tetragonum is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and hardy nature."
