    "intro": "Dryopteris ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The fronds are typically bronze to brown in color, with a distinctive rusty hue on the underside, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction."
