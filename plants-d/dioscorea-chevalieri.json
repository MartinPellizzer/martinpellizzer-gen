    "intro": "Dioscorea chevalieri, commonly known as the African yam vine, is a climbing herbaceous perennial native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible tuberous roots that are used in traditional cuisine. Its tubers are often harvested for their starchy content, making it an important crop in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in woodland or savanna habitats."
