    "intro": "Diploprora truncata, commonly known as the flatleaf liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has simple, lobed leaves that are often arranged in two rows, giving it a distinctive appearance. It reproduces through spores, which are produced in small, cup-like structures called gametophores. Diploprora truncata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
