    "intro": "Diospyros hemiteles, commonly known as the red sapote, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top. The tree produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible fruits with a sweet, custard-like pulp. Its fruit is often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications due to its rich flavor and nutritional value. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its timber."
