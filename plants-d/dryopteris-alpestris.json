    "intro": "Dryopteris alpestris, commonly known as the alpine wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, airy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are borne on the undersides of the fronds in sporangia clusters called sori. Dryopteris alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
