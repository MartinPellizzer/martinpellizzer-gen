    "intro": "Dasystephana sangilenica, commonly known as the Sangilenic star-flower, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking star-shaped flowers, which typically bloom in shades of white and pale purple. The plant has narrow, lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along its slender stems. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
