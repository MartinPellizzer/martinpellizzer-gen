    "intro": "Durio connatus, commonly known as the Malay durian, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its large, spiky fruit that contains a strong, aromatic pulp. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils and requires a warm, sunny environment. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, often with a waxy coating. The fruit is typically harvested when it reaches full size and begins to emit its distinctive odor, signaling ripeness."
