    "intro": "Dendrobium \u00d7 kestevenii, commonly known as the Kesteven's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical climates. Its flowers are typically showy, with a variety of colors including white, pink, and yellow, making it a popular ornamental plant. Dendrobium \u00d7 kestevenii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
