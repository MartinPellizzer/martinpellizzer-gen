It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features upright, branching stems that are covered in soft, hairy tissue, giving it its subspecies name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. It produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the late summer and early autumn, which attract various pollinators."
