    "intro": "Dasylirion stewartii var. glaucum, commonly known as the Stewart\u2019s blue agave, is a perennial succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, waxy, bluish-gray leaves that are often adorned with white or blueish bloom bands. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pale green. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
