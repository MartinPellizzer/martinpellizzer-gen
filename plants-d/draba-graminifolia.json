    "intro": "Draba graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-leaved whitlowgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in a single terminal cluster. Draba graminifolia is native to alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold, harsh environments."
