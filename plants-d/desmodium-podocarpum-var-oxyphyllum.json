    "intro": "Desmodium podocarpum var. oxyphyllum, commonly known as the hairy beggar's tick, is a leguminous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, hairy stems. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has a creeping growth habit and can form dense mats, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. The species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
