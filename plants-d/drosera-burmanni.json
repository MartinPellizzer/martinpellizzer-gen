    "intro": "Drosera burmanni, commonly known as the Burmann's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments and has small, clustered leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pink and bloom during the summer months. Drosera burmanni is a perennial species that thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils."
