    "intro": "Dryopteris gymnopteridifrons, commonly known as the naked-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
