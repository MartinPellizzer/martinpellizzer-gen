    "intro": "Dipholis montana, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dipholis montana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
