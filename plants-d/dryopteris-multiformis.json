    "intro": "Dryopteris multiformis, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate or tripinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it can form dense colonies. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
