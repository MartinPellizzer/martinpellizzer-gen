    "intro": "Digitaria chillanensis, commonly known as the Chilean digitaria, is a grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as fields and roadsides. Digitaria chillanensis is adapted to temperate climates and is often used in ecological studies due to its resilience and rapid growth."
