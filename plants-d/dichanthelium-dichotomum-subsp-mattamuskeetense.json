    "intro": "Dichanthelium dichotomum subsp. mattamuskeetense, commonly known as Mattamuskeet panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy blades that often have a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and pond edges, preferring moist to saturated soil conditions. This subspecies is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to tidal influences in its native range."
