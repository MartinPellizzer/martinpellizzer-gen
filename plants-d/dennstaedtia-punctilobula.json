    "intro": "Dennstaedtia punctilobula, commonly known as the fern with finely lobed fronds, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, and is often found growing on rocks or decaying wood. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important component of understory vegetation in eastern temperate forests."
