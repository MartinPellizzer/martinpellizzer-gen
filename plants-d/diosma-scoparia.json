    "intro": "Diosma scoparia, commonly known as the desert diosma, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Diosma scoparia is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
