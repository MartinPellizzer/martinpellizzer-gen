    "intro": "Diplazium orientale, commonly known as the oriental water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently. Diplazium orientale plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
