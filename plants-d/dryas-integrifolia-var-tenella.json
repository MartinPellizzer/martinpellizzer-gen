    "intro": "Dryas integrifolia var. tenella, commonly known as the alpine stonecrop, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense clusters of small, waxy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in the summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine tundra and subarctic environments. Its slow growth and resilience make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
