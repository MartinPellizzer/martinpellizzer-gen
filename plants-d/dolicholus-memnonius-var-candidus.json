    "intro": "Dolicholus memnonius var. candidus, commonly known as the white-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, white or pale green stems and its clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
