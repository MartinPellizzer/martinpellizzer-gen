    "intro": "Drynaria willdenowii, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically on rocky or cliff faces. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are covered in small, rounded serrations."
