    "intro": "Dendrobium tarawalla, commonly known as the Tarawalla orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its erect, often branched stems that bear clusters of small, pale green to white flowers. The plant has fibrous roots and thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil. Its flowering period typically occurs during the wet season, and it is often found growing on rocks or in dense undergrowth. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
