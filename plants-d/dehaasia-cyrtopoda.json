    "intro": "Dehaasia cyrtopoda, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Dehaasia cyrtopoda plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme conditions."
