    "intro": "Dendrobium finetianum, commonly known as the Finetian orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a fragrant scent, blooming in clusters along the stems. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
