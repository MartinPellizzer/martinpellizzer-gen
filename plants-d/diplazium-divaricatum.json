    "intro": "Diplazium divaricatum, commonly known as the variable sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor. Diplazium divaricatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
