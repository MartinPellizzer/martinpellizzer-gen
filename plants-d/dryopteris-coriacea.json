    "intro": "Dryopteris coriacea, commonly known as the rock fern or leatherleaf fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green, and somewhat rough-textured fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. Dryopteris coriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture for its hardy and adaptable nature."
