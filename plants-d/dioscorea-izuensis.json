    "intro": "Dioscorea izuensis, commonly known as Izu yam, is a climbing vine native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by oval-shaped berries that contain seeds. Its tubers are similar in appearance to other yam species but are often smaller and have a distinct flavor. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions of Japan."
