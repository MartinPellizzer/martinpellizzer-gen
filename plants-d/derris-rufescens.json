    "intro": "Derris rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed derris, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It is known for its toxic properties, particularly due to the presence of rotenone, a natural pesticide. Derris rufescens is often found in disturbed habitats and is used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its toxicity."
