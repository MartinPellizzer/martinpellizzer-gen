    "intro": "Digitalis dubia var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered foxglove, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, erect stems that bear clusters of tubular, white flowers with a distinctive spurred shape. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine pubescence, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This species is closely related to other foxglove species and shares similar medicinal properties, though it is less commonly cultivated. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and woodland borders."
