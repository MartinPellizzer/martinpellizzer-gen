    "intro": "Dischidia borneensis var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy dischidia, is a climbing or trailing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often hairy stems. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptical, and have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. This plant is often grown as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
