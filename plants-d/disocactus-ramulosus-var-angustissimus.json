    "intro": "Disocactus ramulosus var. angustissimus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holiday cactus, is a hybrid species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, branching stems and narrow, waxy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow during the holiday season, typically between November and January. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and seasonal blooming, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
