It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and trifoliate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing small, dark seeds. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is valued for its hard, durable wood. The species is also noted for its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
