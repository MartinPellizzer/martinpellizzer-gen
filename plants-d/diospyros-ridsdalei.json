    "intro": "Diospyros ridsdalei, commonly known as the Ridsdale's persimmon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ebenaceae. It is native to the island of Borneo and is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves and smooth, dark bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange-red, fleshy fruits. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with a dense canopy and a spreading habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
