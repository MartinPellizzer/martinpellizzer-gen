    "intro": "Dendrobenthamia melanotricha, commonly known as the black-haired dendrobium, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in high humidity and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
