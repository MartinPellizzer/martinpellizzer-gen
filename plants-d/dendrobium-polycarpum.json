    "intro": "Dendrobium polycarpum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, upright growth habit with a dense cluster of pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often arranged in a spike-like cluster. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium polycarpum is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
