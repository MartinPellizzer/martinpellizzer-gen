    "intro": "Daphne monnula, commonly known as the small-flowered daphne, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white during late winter to early spring. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and stems, which emit a strong, sometimes spicy scent. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its toxicity, care should be taken to avoid contact with its sap and ingestion of any part of the plant."
