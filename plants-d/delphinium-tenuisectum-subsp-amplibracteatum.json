    "intro": "Delphinium tenuisectum subsp. amplibracteatum, commonly known as the broad-bract delphinium, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its broad, leaf-like bracts that surround the flower spikes, giving it a unique appearance. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its arid habitat. This plant is typically found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
