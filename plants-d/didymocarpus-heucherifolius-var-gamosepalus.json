    "intro": "Didymocarpus heucherifolius var. gamosepalus, commonly known as the silverleaf flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fiery orange to red flowers that appear in clusters, often during the rainy season. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a glossy, dark green upper surface and a silvery or pale underside, giving it its common name. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture and produces small, round fruits that are edible but not widely consumed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
