    "intro": "Dubautia plantaginea subsp. humilis, commonly known as the lowland Dubautia, is a herbaceous perennial native to Hawaii. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as rainforest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in humid environments. It plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
