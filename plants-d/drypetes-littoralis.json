    "intro": "Drypetes littoralis, commonly known as the coastal drypetes, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in coastal areas, often growing in sandy or saline soils, making it an important component of coastal vegetation. Its ability to tolerate salt and wind makes it valuable for stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
