    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 complanata, commonly known as the Hart's-tongue fern, is a hybrid fern that results from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris inopinata. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. The fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
