    "intro": "Diervilla grandiflora, commonly known as rosebay buckeye, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring dense, upright branches with oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early summer, followed by orange-red berries that persist into winter. Its foliage and berries provide food for various birds and wildlife, making it an important component of local ecosystems. Diervilla grandiflora thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for gardens and natural landscapes."
