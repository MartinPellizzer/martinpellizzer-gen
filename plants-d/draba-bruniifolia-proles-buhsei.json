    "intro": "Draba bruniifolia proles buhsei, commonly known as the Buhsei draba, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in mountain meadows. It has basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate, and its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species with limited distribution."
