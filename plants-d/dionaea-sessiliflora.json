    "intro": "Dionaea sessiliflora, commonly known as the Carolina pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of North and South Carolina. It is characterized by its unique, lidless, pitfall-shaped leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture and high humidity. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing after the plant has matured. Dionaea sessiliflora plays an important ecological role by controlling insect populations in its habitat."
