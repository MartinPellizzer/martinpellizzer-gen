    "intro": "Draba strigosula, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Draba strigosula has basal leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its blooming period occurs in early spring, adding a touch of color to high-altitude ecosystems."
