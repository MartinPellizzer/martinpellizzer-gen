    "intro": "Dracula gaskelliana, commonly known as the Gaskell's vampire orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its dark, velvety leaves and elongated, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water, adapting it to its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces striking, hooded flowers with long, curved petals that resemble a vampire's cape, giving it its dramatic common name. It thrives in high-altitude environments with high humidity and dappled sunlight. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts and conservationists."
