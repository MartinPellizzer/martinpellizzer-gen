    "intro": "Donax donax, commonly known as the maritime pine, is a tall evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its long, needle-like leaves and a straight, often wind-swept growth habit. The tree produces cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Its root system is adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils, making it highly resilient in coastal environments. Donax donax plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various coastal species."
