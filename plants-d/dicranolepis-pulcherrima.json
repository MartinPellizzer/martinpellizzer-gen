    "intro": "Dicranolepis pulcherrima, commonly known as the pretty fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer that helps retain moisture. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, ovate-shaped pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance."
