    "intro": "Dolichos balansae, commonly known as the African honey bean, is a climbing legume native to eastern and southern Africa. It produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated pods containing edible, sweet-smelling beans. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and twining stems, which help it climb supports in its natural habitat. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in savannas and woodlands. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential as a food source in traditional diets."
