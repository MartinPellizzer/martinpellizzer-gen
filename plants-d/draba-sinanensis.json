    "intro": "Draba sinanensis, commonly known as the Sinan dwarf cress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at elevations above 2,000 meters. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, dark green leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer. Its flowering period is short, and it relies on self-pollination for reproduction. Draba sinanensis is adapted to cold climates and has a high degree of frost tolerance, making it a resilient species in harsh mountainous habitats."
