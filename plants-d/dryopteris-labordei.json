    "intro": "Dryopteris labordei, commonly known as the Laborde's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and often have a rough texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
