    "intro": "Deschampsia flexuosa subsp. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow and often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid or semi-arid environments."
