    "intro": "Davallia perdurans, commonly known as the evergreen fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and delicate, lace-like fronds that are often bright green. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded garden settings."
