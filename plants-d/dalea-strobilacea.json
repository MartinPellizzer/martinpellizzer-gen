It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique, spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink to purple in color, and it produces small, leathery pods that contain the seeds. Dalea strobilacea is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
