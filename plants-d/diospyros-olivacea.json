    "intro": "Diospyros olivacea, commonly known as the oliveleaf ebony, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family, which includes other ebony trees, and is characterized by its dark, dense wood. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits that are initially green and turn red when mature. Diospyros olivacea is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in crafting and traditional medicine."
