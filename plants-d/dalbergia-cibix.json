    "intro": "Dalbergia cibix, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has bipinnate leaves, meaning the leaves are divided into smaller leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits. Dalbergia cibix is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat."
