    "intro": "Draba stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-capsule rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Draba stenocarpa is adapted to harsh environments, with a compact growth form that helps it withstand cold and wind. It is often found in rocky soils and is an important part of the alpine flora in its native range."
