    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 graeca, commonly known as the European barren fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris affinis and Dryopteris filix-mas. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are typically dark green and deeply divided. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
