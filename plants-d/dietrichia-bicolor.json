    "intro": "Dietrichia bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its strikingly contrasting colors, with green and white or yellow markings on its leaves and flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in botanical gardens and private collections."
