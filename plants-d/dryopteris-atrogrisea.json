    "intro": "Dryopteris atrogrisea, commonly known as the black-brown wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often tinged with a reddish hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Dryopteris atrogrisea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
