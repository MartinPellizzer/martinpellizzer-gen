    "intro": "Dortmanna purpurea, commonly known as the purple bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water and has small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pale purple or white, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Dortmanna purpurea plays a unique ecological role by contributing to nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems."
