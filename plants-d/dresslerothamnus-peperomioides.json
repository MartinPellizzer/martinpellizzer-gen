It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with a waxy, glossy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, often followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
