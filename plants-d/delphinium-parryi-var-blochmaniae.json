    "intro": "Delphinium parryi var. blochmaniae, commonly known as the Sierra delphinium, is a striking member of the Ranunculaceae family native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of vivid blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
