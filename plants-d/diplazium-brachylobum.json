    "intro": "Diplazium brachylobum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
