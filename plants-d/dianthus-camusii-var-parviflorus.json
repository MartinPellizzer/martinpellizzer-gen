It is a low-growing perennial with fleshy, succulent stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and attractive flowers make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
