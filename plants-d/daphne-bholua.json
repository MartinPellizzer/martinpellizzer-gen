    "intro": "Daphne bholua, commonly known as the winter daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It produces clusters of fragrant, waxy flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, often appearing in late winter or early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its showy blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring careful handling and placement."
