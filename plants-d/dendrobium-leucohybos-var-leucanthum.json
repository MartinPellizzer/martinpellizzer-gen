It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, typically in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in environments with seasonal rainfall. Its flowers are showy, with white petals and a yellow lip, and it blooms during the warmer months. The plant requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to thrive."
