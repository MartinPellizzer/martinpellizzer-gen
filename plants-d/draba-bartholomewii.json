    "intro": "Draba bartholomewii, commonly known as Bartholomew's whitlow grass, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments, where it forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale yellow, bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its harsh habitat. Draba bartholomewii is well adapted to cold climates and is often found at high elevations where few other plants can survive."
