    "intro": "Doryopteris angelica, commonly known as the angel's fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The plant's unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
