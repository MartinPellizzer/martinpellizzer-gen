    "intro": "Dulichium spathaceum, commonly known as the common sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North America. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Dulichium spathaceum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting coastal ecosystems."
