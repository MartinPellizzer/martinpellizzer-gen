    "intro": "Dryopteris nakanensis, commonly known as the Nakan's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
