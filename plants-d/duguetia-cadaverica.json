    "intro": "Duguetia cadaverica, commonly known as the corpse flower, is a tropical shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is notable for its unique and somewhat decay-like odor, which is thought to attract carrion-eating insects for pollination. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Duguetia cadaverica is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its striking appearance and unusual scent."
