    "intro": "Dicranopteris costaricensis, commonly known as the Costarica water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are adapted for life in freshwater environments. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters, where it forms dense floating mats. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. Dicranopteris costaricensis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
