It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary economic part of the plant. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and often twining. The tubers are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures."
