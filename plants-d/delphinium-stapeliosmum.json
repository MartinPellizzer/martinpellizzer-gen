    "intro": "Delphinium stapeliosmum, commonly known as the Stapeliopsis delphinium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Delphinium stapeliosmum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
