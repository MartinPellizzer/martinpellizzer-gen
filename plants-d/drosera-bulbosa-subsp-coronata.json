    "intro": "Drosera bulbosa subsp. coronata, commonly known as the crowned sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces a single, erect flowering stem topped with a cluster of small, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or boggy habitats. Its unique appearance and carnivorous habits make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
