    "intro": "Disocactus nelsonii, commonly known as the Queen of the Night, is a cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, nocturnal blooming flowers that open only at night and emit a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant has a short, thick stem with areoles that bear clusters of spines. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it produces bright yellow flowers that last only one night. This unique botanical feature makes it a popular and rare ornamental plant in horticulture."
