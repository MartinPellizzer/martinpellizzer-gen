    "intro": "Desmodium orbiculare var. rubricaule, commonly known as the red-stemmed ticktrefoil, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive red stem and is often found in moist, wooded areas. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
