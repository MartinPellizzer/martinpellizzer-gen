    "intro": "Drymoglossum carnosum var. obovatum, commonly known as the broad-ovate fern, is a variant of the carnosum fern species. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The leaves are pinnately compound, with lanceolate to obovate-shaped fronds that are often densely covered in short, soft hairs. It produces spore-bearing capsules that are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This variety is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology and is found in tropical and subtropical regions."
