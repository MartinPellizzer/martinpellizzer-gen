    "intro": "Dicypellium, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plant is characterized by its composite flower heads, which resemble those of true dandelions, and its alternate, hairy leaves. Dicypellium species typically grow as annual or perennial herbs, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The genus includes several species, such as Dicypellium africanum and Dicypellium tenuifolium, which are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
