    "intro": "Draba carnica, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cold, harsh environments. Draba carnica has basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
