    "intro": "Doxantha unguis-cati var. microphylla, commonly known as the cat's claw ivy, is a climbing plant native to South America. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both useful and potentially invasive in certain regions."
