    "intro": "Dryopteris pterifolia, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features a distinctive frond structure with a shield-shaped base and pinnate lobes that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are typically dark green and can grow up to 1 meter in length, making it a striking ornamental plant."
