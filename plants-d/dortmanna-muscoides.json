    "intro": "Dortmanna muscoides, commonly known as the moss-like liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and small, closely packed leaves that resemble those of mosses. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can retain moisture. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are often clustered and produce male and female reproductive organs. Dortmanna muscoides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
