    "intro": "Draba matthioloides, commonly known as the alpine whitlowgrass, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant typically produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and basal, often covered in a fine layer of white wax, aiding in water retention in its arid, high-altitude habitat. Draba matthioloides is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or alpine soils."
