    "intro": "Dianthus vodnensis, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and it produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dianthus vodnensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in challenging, high-altitude conditions."
