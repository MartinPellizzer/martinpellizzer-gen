    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa f. triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered bluegrass, is a variant of the tufted hairgrass. It is a perennial grass characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant typically produces three to five spikelets per stem, which is a distinguishing feature of this form. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and wetlands. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
