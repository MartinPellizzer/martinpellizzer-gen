    "intro": "Dysoxylum macrostachyum, commonly known as the giant soursop, is a large tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The tree produces large, spiny fruits that resemble a cross between a pineapple and a fig, with a green, fibrous exterior. Its flowers are clustered in panicles and are typically greenish-yellow in color, while its bark is thick and deeply fissured. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
