    "intro": "Dicksonia kaulfussiana, commonly known as the Kaulfuss tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant has a robust root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique feature makes it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
