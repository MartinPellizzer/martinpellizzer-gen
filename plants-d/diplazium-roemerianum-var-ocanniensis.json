    "intro": "Diplazium roemerianum var. ocanniensis, commonly known as the Ocannee spleenwort, is a fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is wiry and covered with a layer of brownish scales, which aid in water retention. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
