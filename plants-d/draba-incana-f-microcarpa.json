    "intro": "Draba incana f. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and Asia. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a compact rosette of basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are pollinated primarily by insects. This subspecies is characterized by its diminutive stature and is well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor soils."
