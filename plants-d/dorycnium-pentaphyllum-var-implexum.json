    "intro": "Dorycnium pentaphyllum var. implexum, commonly known as the creeping goat's beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features a sprawling growth habit with a fibrous root system that allows it to spread across the ground. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, branched inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are hairy and slightly serrated. It is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
