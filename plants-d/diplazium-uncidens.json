    "intro": "Diplazium uncidens, commonly known as the hooked fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, curved fronds that resemble the shape of a hook. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a unique arrangement of pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
