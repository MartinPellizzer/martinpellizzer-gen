    "intro": "Dialyceras discolor, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a yellowish-green thallus with a distinctive, wrinkled surface that gives it its common name. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a symbiotic association between algae and fungi. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Its slow growth and unique coloration make it a notable species in ecological and botanical studies."
