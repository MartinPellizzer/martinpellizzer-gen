    "intro": "Diplazium ceratolepidioides, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive, rugged texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
