    "intro": "Dombeya excelsa, commonly known as the mountain dombeya, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high altitudes of southern Africa. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white, pink, or lilac. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates. Dombeya excelsa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its seasonal floral display."
