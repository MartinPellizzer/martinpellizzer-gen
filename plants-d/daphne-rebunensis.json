    "intro": "Daphne rebunensis, commonly known as the Rebun Daphne, is a rare and ornamental plant native to Japan. It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white during late winter to early spring. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, providing an attractive contrast to the blooms. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
