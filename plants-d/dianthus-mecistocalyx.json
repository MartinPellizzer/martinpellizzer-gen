    "intro": "Dianthus mecistocalyx, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals that curl inward as they age. The plant has a low-growing habit, with hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. The flowers bloom in early summer and are known for their fleeting beauty, opening in the morning and closing by midday."
