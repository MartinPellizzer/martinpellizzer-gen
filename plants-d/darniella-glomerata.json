    "intro": "Darniella glomerata, commonly known as the clustered grass or dwarf grass, is a small, perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant has slender, tufted stems with fine, narrow leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, forming dense, spherical inflorescences that give it its common name. It is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
