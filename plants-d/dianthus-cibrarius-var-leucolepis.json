    "intro": "Dianthus cibrarius var. leucolepis, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or purple hue at the base. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to arid and rocky environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular addition to rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscapes."
