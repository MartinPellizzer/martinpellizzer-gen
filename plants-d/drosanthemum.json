    "intro": "Drosanthemum, commonly known as the \"butterfly flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that resemble butterflies. Drosanthemum species typically thrive in arid or semi-arid environments, making them well-suited for xerophytic conditions. Their flowers are often short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. The genus includes several species, such as Drosanthemum coccineum, which is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its ornamental value."
