    "intro": "Deyeuxia arundinacea var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy bamboo grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, bamboo-like stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
