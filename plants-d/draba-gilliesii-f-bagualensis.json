    "intro": "Draba gilliesii f. bagualensis, commonly known as the Bagualensis whitlow grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves. It is native to high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
