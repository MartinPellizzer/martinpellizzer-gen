    "intro": "Didymocarpus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically 2-4 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, berry-like fruits that are approximately 1 cm in diameter. It thrives in brackish water environments and is often found in mangrove ecosystems. Due to its compact size and adaptability, it plays a minor but important role in coastal ecological systems."
