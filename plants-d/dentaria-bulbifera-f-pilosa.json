It features hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Brassicaceae family. Its bulbs serve as storage organs, allowing it to survive in harsh conditions. The hairy texture of its foliage is a key identifying characteristic."
