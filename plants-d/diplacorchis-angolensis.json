    "intro": "Diplacorchis angolensis, commonly known as the Angola orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers during the wet season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
