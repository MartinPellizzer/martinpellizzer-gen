    "intro": "Diplocaulobium pangunaense, commonly known as the Panguna swamp orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the wetlands of Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow, waterlogged soils, adapting to the humid and tropical conditions of its habitat. Its morphology includes strap-like leaves and a compact, pseudobulbous structure typical of many orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental degradation."
