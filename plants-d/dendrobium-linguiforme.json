    "intro": "Dendrobium linguiforme, commonly known as the tongue-shaped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive tongue-shaped lip that gives it its common name. Dendrobium linguiforme is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
