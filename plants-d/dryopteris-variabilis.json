    "intro": "Dryopteris variabilis, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a perennial fern native to North America. It is characterized by its large, deeply divided fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fertile fronds produce spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. The species is known for its variability in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its common name."
