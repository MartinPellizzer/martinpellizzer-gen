    "intro": "Dryopteris immixta, commonly known as the mixed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are typically divided into two distinct sections, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris immixta is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
