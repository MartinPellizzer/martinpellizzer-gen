    "intro": "Davallia cuneata, commonly known as the shuttlecock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound fronds that resemble shuttlecocks, giving it its common name. The plant features small, rounded sori on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore production. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Davallia cuneata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
