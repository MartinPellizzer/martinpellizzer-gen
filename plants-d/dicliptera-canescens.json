    "intro": "Dicliptera canescens, commonly known as the woolly dicliptera, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in open woodlands and grasslands, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a whitish, hairy underside, which gives it its common name. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered inflorescences that are often hidden beneath the foliage. Dicliptera canescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
