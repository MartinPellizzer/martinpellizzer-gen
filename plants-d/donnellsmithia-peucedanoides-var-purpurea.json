    "intro": "Donnellsmithia peucedanoides var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple-flowered donnellsmithia, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in woodland areas. Its unique coloration and delicate structure make it a notable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
