It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of pink or red flowers with distinctive white markings. The plant features slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to sunny, well-drained environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
