The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, often displaying shades of white and pink, making it a visually striking species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dirichletia paolii is considered a conservation concern."
