    "intro": "Drymaria cordata var. gracilis, commonly known as slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water, typical of xerophytic plants. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
