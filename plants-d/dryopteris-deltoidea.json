    "intro": "Dryopteris deltoidea, commonly known as the deltoid maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that resemble the shape of a delta, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. The fronds are typically a dark green color, with a distinctive silver underside that adds visual interest."
