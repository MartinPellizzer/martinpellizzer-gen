    "intro": "Datura pittieri, commonly known as the Mexican devil's trumpet, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its large, funnel-shaped, bell-like flowers that are often white or pale purple in color. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and the plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds. Due to its striking appearance and toxic properties, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant but requires caution when handling."
