    "intro": "Demosthenesia vilcabambensis, commonly known as the Vilcabamba orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of the Peruvian Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid microclimates. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its harsh environment. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
