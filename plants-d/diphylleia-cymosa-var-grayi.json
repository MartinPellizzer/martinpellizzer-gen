    "intro": "Diphylleia cymosa var. grayi, commonly known as the Gray's diphylleia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences composed of clusters of white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a distinctive waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
