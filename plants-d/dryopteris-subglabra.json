    "intro": "Dryopteris subglabra, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a species of fern characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are smooth to the touch. It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types once established."
