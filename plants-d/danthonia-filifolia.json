    "intro": "Danthonia filifolia, commonly known as the silky hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, hair-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
