    "intro": "Drosera macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested to provide nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It produces showy, red or pink flowers that are often larger than those of other sundew species. Its unique adaptations make it a fascinating subject for both ecological and botanical study."
