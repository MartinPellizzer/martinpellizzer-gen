    "intro": "Discaria australis, commonly known as the coastal holly or coastal wattle, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal regions, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and bright yellow flowers. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds. Discaria australis is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal vegetation and providing habitat for local wildlife."
