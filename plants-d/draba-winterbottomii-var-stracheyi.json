    "intro": "Draba winterbottomii var. stracheyi, commonly known as the Strachey's winterbottom's rockcress, is a small flowering plant native to the alpine regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cold, arid conditions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
