    "intro": "Dendrobium heteroideum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are typically broad and strap-shaped, arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern. Dendrobium heteroideum is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in traditional medicine."
