    "intro": "Dryopteris uniformis var. rufomarginata, commonly known as the red-margin shield fern, is a variant of the uniform shield fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds with distinctive reddish margins. The fronds are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long and have a sturdy, upright growth habit. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
