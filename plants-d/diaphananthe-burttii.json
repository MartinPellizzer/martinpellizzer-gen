    "intro": "Diaphananthe burttii, commonly known as the Burtt's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale greenish-white flowers that resemble translucent petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive three-lobed structure. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species, making it a subject of interest for conservationists and botanists."
