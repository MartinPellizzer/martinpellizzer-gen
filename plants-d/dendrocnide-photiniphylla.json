    "intro": "Dendrocnide photiniphylla, commonly known as the stinging tree, is a flowering plant native to northern Australia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves. The plant is notable for its toxic sap, which contains acutely painful urticating hairs. These hairs can cause severe dermatitis upon contact with the skin. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in rainforest and coastal scrub habitats."
