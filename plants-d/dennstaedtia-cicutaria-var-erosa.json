    "intro": "Dennstaedtia cicutaria var. erosa, commonly known as the erose fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf fern characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The leaves are typically light green, with a soft texture and a distinctive erose margin, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively through fragmentation."
