    "intro": "Dryopteris nicaraguensis, commonly known as the Nicaraguan wood fern, is a species of fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, supporting the growth of its delicate, compound leaves. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a spiral pattern."
