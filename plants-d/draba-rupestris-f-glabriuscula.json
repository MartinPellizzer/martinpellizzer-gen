    "intro": "Draba rupestris f. glabriuscula, commonly known as the glabrous rockcress, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in tight inflorescences, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs in most forms, though this trait is reduced in the glabriuscula form. This variant is notable for its reduced pubescence, making it distinguishable from other members of the species."
