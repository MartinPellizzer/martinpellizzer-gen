    "intro": "Dischidia kutchinensis, commonly known as the Kutchin's bubble vine, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its unique, inflated, balloon-like stems that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by berries that are typically red or orange when mature. This plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in hanging baskets or as a climbing plant in greenhouses."
