    "intro": "Dipcadi serotinum subsp. fulvum, commonly known as the yellow bulbous orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, bulb-like structures that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers with a distinctive, sweet scent. It typically blooms during the warmer months, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
