    "intro": "Dolianthus, commonly known as the \"blue flax\" or \"blue thistle,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). These plants are native to the Mediterranean region and are characterized by their showy, blue or purple flower heads. Dolianthus species typically have hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and they produce small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. They are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their vibrant colors and drought tolerance. Some species are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
