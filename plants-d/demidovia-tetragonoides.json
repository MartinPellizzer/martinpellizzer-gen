It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems that are typically four-angled in cross-section. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in catkins, which are typical of willow species. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and usually have a rough texture. Demidovia tetragonoides is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
