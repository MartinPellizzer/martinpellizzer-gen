    "intro": "Dalbergia clarkei, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in many regions."
