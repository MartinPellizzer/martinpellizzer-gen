    "intro": "Decaloba perfoliata, commonly known as the perfoliate decaloba, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its distinctive leaves that are perfoliate, meaning they have a hole through the middle, allowing the stem to pass through. It produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Decaloba perfoliata is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks."
