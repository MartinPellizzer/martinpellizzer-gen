    "intro": "Diplazium crenulans, commonly known as the serrated chain fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, serrated segments, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across Southeast Asia. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Diplazium crenulans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, foliage."
