    "intro": "Dorstenia djettii, commonly known as the \"bottle plant,\" is a unique member of the Moraceae family, native to the tropical regions of Central America. This plant is characterized by its striking, swollen, bottle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and pointed, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by elongated, fleshy fruits. Dorstenia djettii is often cultivated for its unusual appearance and adaptability to indoor conditions."
