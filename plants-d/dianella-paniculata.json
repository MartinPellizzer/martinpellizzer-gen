    "intro": "Dianella paniculata, commonly known as the common flax lily, is a perennial evergreen plant native to eastern Australia. It features strap-like, dark green leaves that are narrow and grass-like in appearance. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in summer, which are clustered in paniculate inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden planting. Dianella paniculata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
