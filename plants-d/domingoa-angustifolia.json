    "intro": "Domingoa angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf domingoa, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native habitat."
