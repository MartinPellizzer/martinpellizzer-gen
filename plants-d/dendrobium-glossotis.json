    "intro": "Dendrobium glossotis, commonly known as the red-tipped dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit, with cane-like stems that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often with a distinctive yellow or orange lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium glossotis is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
