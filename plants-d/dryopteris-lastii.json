    "intro": "Dryopteris lastii, commonly known as the Lastii Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. Dryopteris lastii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its durability and aesthetic qualities."
