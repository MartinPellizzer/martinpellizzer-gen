    "intro": "Delphinium lycoctonifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved larkspur, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically narrow and arranged alternately along the stem. It prefers well-drained, alkaline soils and full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a poisonous plant and should be handled with care."
