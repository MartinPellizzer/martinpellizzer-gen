    "intro": "Ditassa oxyphylla, commonly known as the white-flowered rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
