    "intro": "Dianthus balansae, commonly known as the Balansae campion, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. It has hairy leaves and a compact growth habit, which help it conserve water and withstand strong winds. Dianthus balansae is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
