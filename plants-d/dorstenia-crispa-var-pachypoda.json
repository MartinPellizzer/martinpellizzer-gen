    "intro": "Dorstenia crispa var. pachypoda, commonly known as the woolly mountain globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a desirable plant for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
