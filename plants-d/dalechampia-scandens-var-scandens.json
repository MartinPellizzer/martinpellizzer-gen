    "intro": "Dalechampia scandens var. scandens, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by spiny, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means make it an invasive species in many regions."
