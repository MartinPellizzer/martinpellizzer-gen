    "intro": "Dendrobium pulleanum, commonly known as the purple-tinged dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with upright, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with a purple or red throat. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
