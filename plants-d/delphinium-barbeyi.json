    "intro": "Delphinium barbeyi, commonly known as the Barbey's larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, typical of the Delphinium genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a striking addition to alpine gardens."
