    "intro": "Dimorphostemon sergievskianus, commonly known as the Serebryansky's dimorphostemon, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive bi-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
