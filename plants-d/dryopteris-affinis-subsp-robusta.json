    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis subsp. robusta, commonly known as the robust shield fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are often deeply divided. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fertile fronds, which develop in late summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
