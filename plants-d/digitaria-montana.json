It is characterized by its dark green, coarse leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along riverbanks. Digitaria montana is an important species in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
