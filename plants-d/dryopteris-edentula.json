    "intro": "Dryopteris edentula, commonly known as the barren fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its sterile fronds, which lack the typical spore-producing structures found in other ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often thick and wiry, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The foliage is dark green and leathery, providing a striking visual contrast in its natural habitat."
