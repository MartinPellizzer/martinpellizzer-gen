    "intro": "Davallia flagellifera, commonly known as the flying spider fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble the legs of a spider, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that produce new plantlets along their length. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a light green color and a feathery appearance. Davallia flagellifera prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
