    "intro": "Dianthus hypoleucus, commonly known as the pale-stemmed campion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and clusters of small, pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and the flowers bloom in early summer. Dianthus hypoleucus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its delicate appearance."
