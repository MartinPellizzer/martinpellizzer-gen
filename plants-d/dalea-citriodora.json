    "intro": "Dalea citriodora, commonly known as lemon verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-pink flowers. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its unique fragrance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native gardens."
