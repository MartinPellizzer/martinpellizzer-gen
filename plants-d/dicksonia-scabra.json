    "intro": "Dicksonia scabra, commonly known as the rough tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The leaves are typically rough and hairy, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and on rocky slopes. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are dispersed by wind, facilitating its reproduction."
