    "intro": "Delphinium cryophilum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Delphinium cryophilum is notable for its toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires careful handling."
