    "intro": "Distichorchis kenepaiensis, commonly known as the Kenepai orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized growth habits. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
