    "intro": "Diplocaulobium connexicostatum, commonly known as the lace-leaf fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are finely divided and arranged in a distinctive, overlapping pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both vegetative and reproductive shoots. The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds."
