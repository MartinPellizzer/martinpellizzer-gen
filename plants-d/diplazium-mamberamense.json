    "intro": "Diplazium mamberamense, commonly known as the Mamberamense water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its floating leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silt. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that help it spread across water surfaces. Its fronds are typically lanceolate and have a distinctive, serrated margin. Diplazium mamberamense plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
