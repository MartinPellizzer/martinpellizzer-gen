It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or blue-gray in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
