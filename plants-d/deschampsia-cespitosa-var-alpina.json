    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa var. alpina, commonly known as alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale blue to greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous environments. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is a common component of alpine meadows and tundra ecosystems."
