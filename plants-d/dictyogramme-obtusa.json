    "intro": "Dictyogramme obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in aquatic gardens."
