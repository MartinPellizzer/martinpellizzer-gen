It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive silvery-blue hue on the underside, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical rainforests. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
