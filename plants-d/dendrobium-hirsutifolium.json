    "intro": "Dendrobium hirsutifolium, commonly known as the hairy-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, wiry stems covered in dense, hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are typically white or pale green with a distinctive, fragrant scent. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
