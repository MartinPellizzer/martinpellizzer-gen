    "intro": "Dendrobium clavatum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive golden spike-like structure. Its leaves are linear and arranged spirally along the stem, contributing to its unique appearance. Dendrobium clavatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking blooms."
