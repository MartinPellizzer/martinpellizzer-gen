    "intro": "Dryopteris skottsbergii, commonly known as the Skottsberg's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often slightly curled at the tips. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically in shaded forest understories. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia."
