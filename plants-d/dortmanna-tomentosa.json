    "intro": "Dortmanna tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant is typically found in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and it is known for its ability to photosynthesize efficiently in low-light conditions. Dortmanna tomentosa is a carnivorous plant that traps and digests small aquatic invertebrates to supplement its nutrient intake."
