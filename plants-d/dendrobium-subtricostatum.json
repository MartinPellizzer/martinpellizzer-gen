    "intro": "Dendrobium subtricostatum, commonly known as the three-ribbed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
