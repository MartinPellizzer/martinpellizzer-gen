    "intro": "Danthonia provincialis var. elata, commonly known as the tall coastal grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and coastal conditions. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
