It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full sun. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens with caution."
