It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. It has small, leathery leaves and produces red berries that are an important food source for birds. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is a popular plant for coastal landscaping."
