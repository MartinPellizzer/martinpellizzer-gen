    "intro": "Dyera, commonly known as the dyera plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Berberidaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Dyera costulata, which is native to Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically oval or elliptic in shape and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Dyera species are often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. They produce small, yellowish flowers that are followed by red or orange berries, which are edible and used in traditional medicine."
