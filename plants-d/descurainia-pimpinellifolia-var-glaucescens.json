    "intro": "Descurainia pimpinellifolia var. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous bladderwort, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is typically found in moist, sandy soils along the shores of lakes and ponds. It is an annual herb that often grows in dense clusters, and its leaves are covered in a waxy, bluish coating. This variety is distinguished by its glaucous appearance, which helps reduce water loss in its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat."
