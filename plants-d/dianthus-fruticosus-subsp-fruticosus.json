    "intro": "Dianthus fruticosus subsp. fruticosus, commonly known as the creeping carnation, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are linear to oblanceolate, with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant is drought-tolerant once established. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
