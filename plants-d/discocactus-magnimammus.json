    "intro": "Discocactus magnimammus, commonly known as the giant mammillated cactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height, adorned with prominent, white spines. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for water storage, allowing it to thrive in extreme desert conditions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for both botanists and conservationists."
