    "intro": "Desmodium macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-seeded desmodium, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several round, edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Desmodium macrocarpum is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
