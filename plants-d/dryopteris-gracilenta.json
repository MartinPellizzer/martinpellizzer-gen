    "intro": "Dryopteris gracilenta, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often arched or curved, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
