    "intro": "Dendrocnide kotoensis, commonly known as the Koto stinging tree, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes many stinging plants, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a potent irritant. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its stems are woody and often have a milky sap that can cause severe skin irritation. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a dangerous plant for both humans and animals."
