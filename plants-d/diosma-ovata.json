    "intro": "Diosma ovata, commonly known as the smooth diosma, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are typically pale green to yellowish in color, which helps in attracting pollinators. Diosma ovata is adapted to survive in drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
