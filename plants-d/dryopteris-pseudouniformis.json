    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudouniformis, commonly known as the false shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are used for spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and rocky areas. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a dense, ornamental appearance throughout the year."
