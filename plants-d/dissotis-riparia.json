    "intro": "Dissotis riparia, commonly known as the river sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as riverbanks and swampy areas. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation along water edges. Dissotis riparia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
