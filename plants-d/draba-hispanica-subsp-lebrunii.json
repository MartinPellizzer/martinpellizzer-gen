    "intro": "Draba hispanica subsp. lebrunii, commonly known as the Iberian whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and parts of southern France. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 5\u201315 cm. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the harsh, rocky environments it inhabits. This subspecies is often found in limestone soils and is characteristic of Mediterranean scrublands and mountainous regions."
