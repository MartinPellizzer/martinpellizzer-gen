    "intro": "Dryopteris vasta, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its hardy nature."
