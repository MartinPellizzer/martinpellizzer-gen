    "intro": "Dryas octopetala, commonly known as the mountain avens, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of white, petal-like bracts that surround small yellow flowers. The plant is native to the alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, thriving in rocky and well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically dark green, leathery, and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to conserve moisture in harsh environments. Dryas octopetala plays an important ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small organisms."
