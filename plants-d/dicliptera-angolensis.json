    "intro": "Dicliptera angolensis, commonly known as Angola grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit with dense, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
