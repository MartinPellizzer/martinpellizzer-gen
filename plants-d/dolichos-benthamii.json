    "intro": "Dolichos benthamii, commonly known as the African bean or slender cowpea, is a climbing legume native to Africa. It features compound leaves with three to five oval leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, bean-like pods. The plant is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. It is valued for its edible seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. Additionally, Dolichos benthamii plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria."
