    "intro": "Deplanchea sessilifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sterculia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, ovate, glossy leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack petioles. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
