    "intro": "Dolichos prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate dolichos, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is a low-growing, herbaceous annual that typically spreads along the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a hairy texture. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The seeds of Dolichos prostratus are encased in small, oblong pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals."
