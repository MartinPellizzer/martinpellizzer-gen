    "intro": "Dryopteris adenochlamys, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, deeply divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread through vegetative reproduction. The fronds are biennial, with the fiddleheads emerging in the spring and maturing throughout the growing season."
