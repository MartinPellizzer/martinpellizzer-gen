It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense spikes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated edges, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
