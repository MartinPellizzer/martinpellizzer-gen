    "intro": "Drosera angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are covered in sticky, glandular hairs which trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually pink or red, and bloom in summer. Drosera angustifolia is a perennial species that relies on insect prey for essential nutrients due to the nutrient-poor soils it inhabits."
