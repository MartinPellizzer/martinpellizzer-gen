    "intro": "Diplacorchis conica, commonly known as the conical orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, conical flower spike that bears small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in humid tropical environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Diplacorchis conica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
