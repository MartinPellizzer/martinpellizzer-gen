    "intro": "Drymocallis glutinosa, commonly known as sticky goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in the late summer and early autumn. The plant produces sticky, resinous secretions, which give it its common name and help protect it from herbivores. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs. Drymocallis glutinosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks."
