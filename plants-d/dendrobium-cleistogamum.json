    "intro": "Dendrobium cleistogamum, commonly known as the closed-flower orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, branching stem system with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces small, often hidden, cleistogamous flowers that do not open, facilitating self-pollination. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium cleistogamum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
