It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, muddy habitats such as marshes and riverbanks. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed structure that releases seeds when disturbed. Daucus aureus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
