    "intro": "Dryopteris patula var. rossii, commonly known as the Ross's wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that form a dense, bushy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, delicate appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
