    "intro": "Daphne mucronata subsp. linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved daphne, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, fleshy stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for gardeners in arid climates."
