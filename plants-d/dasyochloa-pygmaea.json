    "intro": "Dasyochloa pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf hairgrass, is a small, perennial grass species native to the wetlands and marshes of the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in areas with standing water or high humidity. Due to its compact size and ability to form dense mats, it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
