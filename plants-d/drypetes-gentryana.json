    "intro": "Drypetes gentryana, commonly known as the Gentry's drypetes, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which is characterized by its diverse morphology and often milky sap. The plant typically grows in lowland forests and exhibits a compact, rounded canopy with glossy, elliptical leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in yellowish-green inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
