    "intro": "Dryopteris juxtaposita, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of foliage. The spores are released from sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
