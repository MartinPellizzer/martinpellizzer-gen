It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant is known for its milky sap, which contains latex and is often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Diplostephium obtusum plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
