    "intro": "Daucus carota f. goodmanii, commonly known as the Goodman's carrot, is a rare horticultural form of the wild carrot. It is characterized by its unique, swollen root that is typically smaller and more compact than the common carrot. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its foliage consists of finely divided, feathery leaves that are aromatic when crushed. This variety is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value and as a unique addition to botanical gardens."
