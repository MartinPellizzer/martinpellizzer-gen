    "intro": "Didymaotus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has elongated, strap-like leaves and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Didymaotus is notable for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered in many regions."
