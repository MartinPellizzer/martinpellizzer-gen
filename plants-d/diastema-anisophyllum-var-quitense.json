It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant has a low-growing habit with slender stems and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry environments. The flowers bloom in early spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
