    "intro": "Duranta plumieri var. strigillosa, commonly known as the silverleaf duranta, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and clusters of tubular, blue-violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is a shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to 10 feet, and is well-suited for tropical and subtropical climates. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a fuzzy texture that enhances its ornamental appeal. The silverleaf duranta is also valued for its ability to attract birds and butterflies due to its nectar-rich flowers."
