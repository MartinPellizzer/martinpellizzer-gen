    "intro": "Drosera aliciae, commonly known as the Alice's Sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of southern Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects, a common adaptation among sundew species. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding to its ornamental appeal. Drosera aliciae thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires consistent humidity to flourish. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a fascinating subject for both botanists and plant enthusiasts."
