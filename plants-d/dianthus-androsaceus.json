It belongs to the Carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, pink or white flowers. The plant typically blooms in early summer, producing clusters of small, rounded petals that resemble miniature carnations. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements. Dianthus androsaceus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
