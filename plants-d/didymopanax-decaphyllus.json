It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is cultivated in some botanical gardens and private collections."
