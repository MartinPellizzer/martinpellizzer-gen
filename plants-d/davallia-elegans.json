    "intro": "Davallia elegans, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive, lacy appearance, often with a dark green to brownish hue. The plant has rhizomes that grow horizontally, producing clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves called sporangia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil. Davallia elegans is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas."
