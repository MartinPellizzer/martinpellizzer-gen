    "intro": "Dryopteris protecta, commonly known as the Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Dryopteris protecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
