    "intro": "Doselia epifita, commonly known as the epiphytic orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, thin stems and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Doselia epifita is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests."
