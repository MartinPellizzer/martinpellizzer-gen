    "intro": "Drosera tenella, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, mat-forming species that typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. The plant is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and are borne on slender stalks above the leaf rosette. Drosera tenella is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
