It is characterized by its erect, branched fronds that are covered with small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are pinnate, with lanceolate leaflets that are dark green and glossy in appearance."
