    "intro": "Dichanthelium strigosum var. leucoblepharis, commonly known as the white-veined panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with a distinctive white or light-colored midrib, which gives it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing two or three bracts. This variety is often found in disturbed wetlands and is considered an indicator species for hydric soils."
