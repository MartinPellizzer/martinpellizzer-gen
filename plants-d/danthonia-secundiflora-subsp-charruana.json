    "intro": "Danthonia secundiflora subsp. charruana, commonly known as Charruana grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
