    "intro": "Drosera prophylla, commonly known as the small-leaved sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of slender, hairless leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its small, white flowers are arranged in a dense inflorescence and bloom during the cooler months. Drosera prophylla is a low-growing plant that thrives in humid conditions and requires careful management to avoid overwatering."
