It is characterized by its erect, branched stems that often bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to grow in rocky or crevice habitats. Its leaves are usually ovate and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium calcicola is valued for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native environment."
