    "intro": "Dalechampia cissifolia, commonly known as the creeping sycamore or velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a type of modified inflorescence. It is native to Central and South America and thrives in humid, shady environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
