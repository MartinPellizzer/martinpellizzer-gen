    "intro": "Daucus pectinaceus, commonly known as the pectinaceous carrot, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many familiar herbs and vegetables such as parsley and celery. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. Its roots are typically small and not as fleshy as those of the common carrot, making it less cultivated for food. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes grown in gardens for its delicate appearance."
