    "intro": "Dactyloctenium buchananensis, commonly known as the African grass or Buchanan's grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands, savannas, and along roadsides. Due to its hardiness and rapid growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
