    "intro": "Donax purpurea, commonly known as the purple beach grass, is a coastal plant native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, saline environments and is often found in dune ecosystems. The plant has slender, erect stems that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its small, purple flowers appear in summer and are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Donax purpurea plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
