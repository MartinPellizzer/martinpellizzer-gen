    "intro": "Dryopteris laevis, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a smooth, glossy texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Dryopteris laevis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
