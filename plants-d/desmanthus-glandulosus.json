    "intro": "Desmanthus glandulosus, commonly known as the hairy desmanthus, is a perennial legume native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with glandular hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Desmanthus glandulosus is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a beneficial plant for soil enrichment."
