    "intro": "Dryopteris megacuspis, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
