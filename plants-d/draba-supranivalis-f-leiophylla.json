    "intro": "Draba supranivalis f. leiophylla, commonly known as the smooth-leaved alpine bellflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to high-altitude environments in the Alps and surrounding mountain ranges. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately compound leaves. The plant is adapted to extreme conditions, thriving in cold, rocky soils with limited nutrients. Its smooth, fleshy leaves help reduce water loss in arid, high-altitude habitats. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in alpine ecosystems."
