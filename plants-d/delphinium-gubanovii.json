It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense spikes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture, and its roots are fibrous and deep-reaching. Delphinium gubanovii is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
