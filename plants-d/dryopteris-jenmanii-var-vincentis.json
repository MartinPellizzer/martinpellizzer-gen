    "intro": "Dryopteris jenmanii var. vincentis, commonly known as Vincent's wood fern, is a variant of the Jenman's wood fern, native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of sporangia on the underside of the fronds. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is occasionally cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
