    "intro": "Dyckia tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dyckia, is a perennial bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces striking inflorescences of red, orange, or yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with bright, indirect light. Dyckia tenuis is often used in rock gardens or as a container plant due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
