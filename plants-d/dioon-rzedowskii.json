    "intro": "Dioon rzedowskii, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its robust, palm-like appearance with a stout trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Dioon rzedowskii is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in limestone areas. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in some regions."
