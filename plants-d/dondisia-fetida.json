    "intro": "Dondisia fetida, commonly known as the stinking corpse flower, is a unique plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is notable for its large, dark red or purple flowers that emit a strong, unpleasant odor reminiscent of decaying flesh. This odor serves to attract pollinators such as flies and carrion beetles. The plant is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its spathe and spadix floral structure. Dondisia fetida is a relatively rare and endangered species, often found in humid, shaded environments."
