    "intro": "Davilla macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved davilla, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that can reach up to 20 cm in length, which are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties."
