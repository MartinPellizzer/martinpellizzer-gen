    "intro": "Desmodium guianense, commonly known as the Guianese burr legume, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant features trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers. Its fruit is a pod that contains several seeds, often with a hooked or barbed structure for seed dispersal. Desmodium guianense is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
