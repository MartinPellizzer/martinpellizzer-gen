    "intro": "Dermatophyllum juanhintonianum, commonly known as the Juan Hinton's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often bioluminescent petals that emit a faint glow in the dark. The plant has a compact, low-growing structure with thick, waxy leaves adapted to withstand extreme cold and high UV radiation. Its flowers are ephemeral, blooming only during specific meteorological conditions, such as after heavy rainfall. Due to its extreme habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered one of the most elusive and poorly understood botanical species in the world."
