It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. Its rapid growth habit and ability to climb make it a common ornamental and sometimes invasive species in certain areas."
