    "intro": "Dracocephalum integrifolium, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, sky-blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a slightly fuzzy texture. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
