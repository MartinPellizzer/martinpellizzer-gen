    "intro": "Diplachne maritima, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Asia. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in marshes, estuaries, and tidal flats. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. Diplachne maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
