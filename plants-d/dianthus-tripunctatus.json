    "intro": "Dianthus tripunctatus, commonly known as the three-spotted campion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pink or red petals and a distinctive five-lobed calyx. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its flowers bloom in early summer, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Dianthus tripunctatus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a short-lived perennial."
