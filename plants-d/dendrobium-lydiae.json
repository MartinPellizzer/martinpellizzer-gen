    "intro": "Dendrobium lydiae, commonly known as Lydia's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforest environments. The plant features tall, cane-like stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. Its blooms, which are typically white or pale yellow, appear in late summer and can last for several weeks. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Dendrobium lydiae is considered critically endangered and is protected by conservation efforts."
