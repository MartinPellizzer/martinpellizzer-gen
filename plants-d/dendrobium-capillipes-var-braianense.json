It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, wiry stems that can reach several meters in length, with clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
