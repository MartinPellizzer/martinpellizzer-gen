It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated pods containing flat, seed-like structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests or along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local communities."
