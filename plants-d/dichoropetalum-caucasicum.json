    "intro": "Dichoropetalum caucasicum, commonly known as the Caucasian dichoropetalum, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to temperate climates. Its flowers are small and white, often arranged in clusters, and it produces a distinctive, aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native range."
