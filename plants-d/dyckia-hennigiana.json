    "intro": "Dyckia hennigiana, commonly known as the Hennig's dyckia, is a species of flowering plant in the bromeliad family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces striking red or orange inflorescences that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Dyckia hennigiana is known for its drought tolerance and ability to withstand extreme temperatures."
