    "intro": "Dalbergaria lanata, commonly known as the woolly burr legume, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
