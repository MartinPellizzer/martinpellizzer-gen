    "intro": "Draba splendens, commonly known as the splendour whitlowgrass, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss. Draba splendens is noted for its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in early spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
