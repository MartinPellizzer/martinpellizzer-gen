    "intro": "Diarthron arenarium, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a member of the Lecanorales order. It is a photobiont lichen that forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found on rocky surfaces or sandy soils. Its structure consists of a crustose thallus, which is tightly adhered to the substrate. Diarthron arenarium plays a role in soil stabilization and is an indicator species for dry, nutrient-poor habitats."
