    "intro": "Dryopteris rhombea, commonly known as the broad female fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its robust, rhombic-shaped fronds that are often divided into lanceolate segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its fertile fronds produce spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. Dryopteris rhombea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
