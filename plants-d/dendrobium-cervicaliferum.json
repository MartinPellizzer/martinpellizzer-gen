It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces long, pendulous inflorescences with numerous fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to withstand periods of drought. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media."
