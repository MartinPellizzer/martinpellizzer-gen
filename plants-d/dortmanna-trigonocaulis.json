    "intro": "Dortmanna trigonocaulis, commonly known as the three-lobed liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, leafy liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive thalloid structure with a central axis and lateral lobes that form a triangular shape, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are usually arranged in a spiral pattern and are often covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Dortmanna trigonocaulis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
