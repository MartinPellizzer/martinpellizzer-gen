    "intro": "Dracula lactea, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its pale, ghostly appearance, with translucent petals that resemble the color of milk, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a specific balance of moisture and light to flourish. Due to its rarity and unique beauty, it is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts."
