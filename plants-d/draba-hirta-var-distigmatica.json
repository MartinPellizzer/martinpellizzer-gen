It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cross-shaped flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically has dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine plantings."
