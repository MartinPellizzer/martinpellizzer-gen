    "intro": "Delphinium hybridum var. sulphureum, commonly known as the sulphur yellow larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically blue-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and pets."
