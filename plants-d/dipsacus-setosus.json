    "intro": "Dipsacus setosus, commonly known as the goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spiny bracts that surround its showy, pink or purple flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are wiry and somewhat woody. Dipsacus setosus is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and has a long history in traditional herbal medicine."
