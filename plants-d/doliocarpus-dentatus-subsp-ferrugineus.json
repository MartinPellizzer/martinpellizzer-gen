It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical to ovate in shape. The leaves are often covered in a rusty-colored pubescence, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. This species is valued for its ornamental potential and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its foliage."
