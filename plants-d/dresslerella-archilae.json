    "intro": "Dresslerella archilae, commonly known as the St. Helena orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. This terrestrial orchid belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct lip. It thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to the island's unique microclimate. The plant has a short flowering period, typically during the warmer months, and is pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
