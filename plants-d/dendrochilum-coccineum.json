    "intro": "Dendrochilum coccineum, commonly known as the red-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red lips on the petals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive coloration that ranges from red to pink. Dendrochilum coccineum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
