    "intro": "Drymoglossum rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, densely packed, and often cushion-like growth form, with leaves that are typically rounded or ovate in shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices, where it can retain moisture. Its leaves are usually less than 1 cm in length, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. This moss plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat."
