    "intro": "Diodonopsis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves and showy, pentagonal flowers that are often pink or purple in color. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types. Diodonopsis species are often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. They play a role in both ecological systems and are sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
