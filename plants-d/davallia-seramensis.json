    "intro": "Davallia seramensis, commonly known as the Seram shield fern, is a species of fern native to the island of Seram in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on rock surfaces or in moist, shaded forest areas. Its rhizomes are short and horizontal, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
