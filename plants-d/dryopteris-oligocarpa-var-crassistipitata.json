It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are typically 60\u2013120 cm in length. The fronds are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with prominent, broad, and spreading pinnae. This variety is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
