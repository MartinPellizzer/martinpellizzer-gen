    "intro": "Dolichos glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded lobes. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that give way to elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Dolichos glabrescens is valued for its nutritional content, including protein and essential amino acids. It also plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
