    "intro": "Dracaena laurentii var. linearifolia, commonly known as the \"Janet Craig\" or \"Rothschild's Dracaena,\" is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features dark green, elongated, strap-like leaves that are slightly curled and have a waxy texture. The plant is characterized by its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though these are rarely seen in cultivation. The varietal form linearifolia distinguishes it by its narrow, linear leaves compared to the broader foliage of other Dracaena species."
