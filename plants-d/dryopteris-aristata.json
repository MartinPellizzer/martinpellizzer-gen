    "intro": "Dryopteris aristata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments with a distinctive, sharp-pointed tip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies."
