    "intro": "Deparia chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a network of roots that help anchor it to the substrate. Deparia chinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like foliage."
