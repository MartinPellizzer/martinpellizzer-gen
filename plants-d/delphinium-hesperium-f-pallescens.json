    "intro": "Delphinium hesperium f. pallescens, commonly known as the pale delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in raceme clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with lance-shaped leaflets that are arranged alternately along the stem. This variety is distinguished by its pale coloration, which sets it apart from other delphinium species."
