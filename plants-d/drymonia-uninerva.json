    "intro": "Drymonia uninerva, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fern, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it in soil and absorb nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of its reproductive biology."
