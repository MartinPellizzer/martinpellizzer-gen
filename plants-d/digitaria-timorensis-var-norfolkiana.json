    "intro": "Digitaria timorensis var. norfolkiana, commonly known as Norfolk grass, is a perennial grass species native to the island of Norfolk in the Pacific. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy environments. Due to its resilience and adaptability, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a stabilizing plant in disturbed soils."
