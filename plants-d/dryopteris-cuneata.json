    "intro": "Dryopteris cuneata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, glossy, dark green fronds that resemble a cinnamon stick, hence its common name. The plant has a tall, central fiddlehead that unfurls into a broad, bipinnate structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The rhizomes of Dryopteris cuneata are thick and creeping, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies."
