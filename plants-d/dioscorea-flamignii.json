    "intro": "Dioscorea flamignii, commonly known as the Malawi yam, is a climbing vine native to Africa, particularly found in the eastern regions of the continent. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are used in traditional medicine and as a food source. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into capsule fruits. Its botanical significance lies in its role in local ecosystems and its potential for agricultural use in underutilized crops."
