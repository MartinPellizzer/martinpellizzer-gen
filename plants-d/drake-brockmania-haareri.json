    "intro": "Drake-brockmania haareri, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Drake-brockmania haareri is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
