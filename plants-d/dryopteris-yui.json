    "intro": "Dryopteris yui, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Dryopteris yui is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
