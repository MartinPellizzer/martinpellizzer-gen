    "intro": "Dryobalanops neglectus, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is known for its slow growth rate, which contributes to its rarity. It has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species."
