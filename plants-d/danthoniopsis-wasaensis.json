It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brown flowers. Danthoniopsis wasaensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
