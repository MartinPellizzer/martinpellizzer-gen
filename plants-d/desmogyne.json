It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white or greenish flowers. The plant's most distinctive feature is its long, slender, thread-like fruits that resemble silk, giving it its common name.

They thrive in moist, well-drained soils and are relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
