It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are typically green with red or purple margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Dracaena afzelii is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
