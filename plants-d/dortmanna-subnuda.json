    "intro": "Dortmanna subnuda, commonly known as the naked Dortmanna, is a small, annual herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grassy habitats. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval to lance-shaped with smooth margins. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in loose clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as capsules. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
