    "intro": "Desmodium intortum var. apiculatum, commonly known as the hairy sainfoin, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in forage and soil enrichment."
