    "intro": "Dendrobium testiculatum, commonly known as the testicle orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Dendrobium testiculatum is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
