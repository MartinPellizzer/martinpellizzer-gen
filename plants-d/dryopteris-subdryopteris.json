    "intro": "Dryopteris subdryopteris, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply divided fronds that are often covered in a rusty-brown, cinnamon-colored coating on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces sporangia in clusters called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
