    "intro": "Dendroseris micrantha var. pruinata, commonly known as the pruinose dandelion, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves and flowers are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat."
