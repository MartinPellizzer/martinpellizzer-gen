    "intro": "Deparia auriculata var. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features lanceolate leaves with auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
