    "intro": "Dendrophthoe villosa, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its modified leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its aerial roots attach to the host tree, allowing it to absorb resources from the host. Dendrophthoe villosa plays a role in ecological interactions, influencing the health and diversity of its host species."
