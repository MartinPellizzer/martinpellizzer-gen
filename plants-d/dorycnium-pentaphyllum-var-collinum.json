    "intro": "Dorycnium pentaphyllum var. collinum, commonly known as the alpine cow vetch, is a perennial legume native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient plant in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
