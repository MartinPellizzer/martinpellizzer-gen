    "intro": "Dioscorea variifolia, commonly known as the variable yam, is a climbing herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are used as a food source in many cultures. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically followed by capsule fruits. Its tubers are rich in starch and can be boiled, roasted, or fried, making them an important staple in some regions. The plant also has traditional medicinal uses, though its toxicity requires careful handling."
