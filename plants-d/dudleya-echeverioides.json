    "intro": "Dudleya echeverioides, commonly known as the silver bush or rock dudleya, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense, compact rosettes of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, pink or white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for coastal and Mediterranean climates."
