    "intro": "Dioscorea villosa var. glabra, commonly known as wild yam, is a perennial vine native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, though the varietal form glabra has smoother, hairless foliage. The plant produces yellowish flowers followed by tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for medicinal and culinary purposes. Its roots contain compounds like diosgenin, which are chemically similar to steroid hormones. This species is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its traditional and potential pharmaceutical applications."
