    "intro": "Dupatya sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flower daisy, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
