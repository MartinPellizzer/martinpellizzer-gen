    "intro": "Drymoglossum abbreviatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed feather moss, is a small, evergreen moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. It has a dense, cushion-like growth form with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often curved at the tips. The leaves are usually less than 1 cm in length and have a distinct midrib. It produces spore-bearing capsules that are clustered in dense groups on short, erect stems. This moss is often found in forest floors and is an important component of the microhabitat for various invertebrates."
