    "intro": "Dicksonia lanata subsp. hispida, commonly known as the hispid tree fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered with persistent, fibrous roots and a crown of large, pinnate fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and have a rough, hairy texture, which gives the plant its subspecific name \"hispida.\" This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular ornamental plant in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
