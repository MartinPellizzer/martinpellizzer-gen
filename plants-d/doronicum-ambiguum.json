    "intro": "Doronicum ambiguum, commonly known as the alpine leopard's ear, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that resemble the fur of a leopard, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges. Doronicum ambiguum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
