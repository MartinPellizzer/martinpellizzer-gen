    "intro": "Datura bojeri, commonly known as the desert thornapple, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces large, showy trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale lavender in color. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its hot, dry environment. Its fruit is a spiny capsule that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Datura bojeri is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of tropane alkaloids."
