    "intro": "Dalhousiea ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leafed rock-heath, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. Dalhousiea ovalifolia is well adapted to salty sea air and can tolerate light coastal breezes."
