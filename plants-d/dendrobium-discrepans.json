    "intro": "Dendrobium discrepans, commonly known as the variable orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, wiry stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium discrepans is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in traditional medicine."
