    "intro": "Danthonia chiapasensis, commonly known as the Chiapas danthonia, is a rare grass species native to the humid lowland forests of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in association with other understory vegetation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
