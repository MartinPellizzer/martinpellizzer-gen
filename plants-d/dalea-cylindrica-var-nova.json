It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces legume pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. Dalea cylindrica var. nova is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
