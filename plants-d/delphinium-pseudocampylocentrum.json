    "intro": "Delphinium pseudocampylocentrum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, typically growing in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care."
