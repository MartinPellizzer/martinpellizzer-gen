    "intro": "Daucus communis subsp. carota, commonly known as wild carrot, is a biennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a taproot that is typically white or yellowish, with finely divided, feathery leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, white or greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in the summer. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp that splits into two one-seeded parts when mature. The species is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine and as a forage plant."
