    "intro": "Decalepidanthus, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It consists of two species, Decalepidanthus kirkii and Decalepidanthus mackinderi, both characterized by their distinctive wheel-like inflorescences. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. They are adapted to arid environments and are often found growing near water sources. Decalepidanthus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens."
