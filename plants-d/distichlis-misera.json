    "intro": "Distichlis misera, commonly known as saltgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and Mexico. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its low-growing, tufted appearance. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh coastal environments. Its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences are typical of its ecological niche. Distichlis misera plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal areas."
