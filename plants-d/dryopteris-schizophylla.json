    "intro": "Dryopteris schizophylla, commonly known as the split-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments, giving it a unique, delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
