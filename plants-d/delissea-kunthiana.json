    "intro": "Delissea kunthiana, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, succulent-like leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Delissea kunthiana is well adapted to extreme drought conditions and is often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes."
