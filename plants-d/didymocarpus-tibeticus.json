    "intro": "Didymocarpus tibeticus, commonly known as the Tibetan date plum, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal, Bhutan, and China. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange to red fruits that are edible and resemble small plums. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
