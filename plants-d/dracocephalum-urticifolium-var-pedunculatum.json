    "intro": "Dracocephalum urticifolium var. pedunculatum, commonly known as blueweed or field hyssop, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects."
