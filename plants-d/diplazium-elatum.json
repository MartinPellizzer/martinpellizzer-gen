    "intro": "Diplazium elatum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, elongated shape and a fibrous texture. Diplazium elatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along stream banks."
