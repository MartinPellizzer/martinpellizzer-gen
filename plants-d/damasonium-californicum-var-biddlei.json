    "intro": "Damasonium californicum var. biddlei, commonly known as the California water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a distinct central vein. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters near the water's edge. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health."
