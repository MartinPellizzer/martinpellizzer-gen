    "intro": "Dryopteris bodinieri, commonly known as the Bodinier wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply divided fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients effectively. The spores are released from small, round sporangia clustered on the undersides of the fronds."
