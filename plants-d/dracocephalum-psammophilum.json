    "intro": "Dracocephalum psammophilum, commonly known as sand-plant or desert skullcap, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in steppes and deserts. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Dracocephalum psammophilum is valued for its medicinal properties, with traditional uses in treating respiratory and digestive ailments."
