    "intro": "Deyeuxia caespitosa, commonly known as tufted false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant forms dense clumps with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in panicles, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Deyeuxia caespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
