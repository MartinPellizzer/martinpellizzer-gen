    "intro": "Diplomorpha capitellata, commonly known as the small-headed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, submerged leaves that often form bladders to trap prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving water, where it can anchor itself with its root system. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in late summer. Despite its delicate appearance, it plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations."
