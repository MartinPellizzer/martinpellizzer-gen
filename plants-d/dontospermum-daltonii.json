    "intro": "Dontospermum daltonii, commonly known as the Dalton's rock fig, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, woody shrub that typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to habitat destruction, Dontospermum daltonii is considered vulnerable and is the subject of conservation efforts."
