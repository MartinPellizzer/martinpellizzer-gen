    "intro": "Daphnopsis granitica, commonly known as the granite daphnopsis, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific rocky habitats. It is characterized by its compact growth form and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
