    "intro": "Dactylorhiza incarnata subsp. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, preferring shaded environments with rich, moist soil. The plant features a tall, slender stem with several pale green to white flowers that have a distinctive spurred lip. Its roots are often associated with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. This subspecies is notable for its ecological significance in wetland ecosystems and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
