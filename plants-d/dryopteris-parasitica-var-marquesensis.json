    "intro": "Dryopteris parasitica var. marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesan climbing fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its long, creeping rhizomes and slender, pinnately compound fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The fronds are typically dark green with a glossy surface and possess a distinctive, somewhat leathery texture. This variety is notable for its parasitic tendencies, as it can derive some nutrients from its host plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
