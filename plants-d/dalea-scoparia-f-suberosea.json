    "intro": "Dalea scoparia f. suberosea, commonly known as the velvetleaf burr sage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in arid landscapes."
