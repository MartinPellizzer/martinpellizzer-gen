    "intro": "Dendrochilum pulcherrimum, commonly known as the beautiful tree orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often fragrant, orchid flowers that come in a variety of colors, including pink, yellow, and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, helping it survive in its often humid and shaded environment. The flowers are usually borne on terminal racemes, adding to its ornamental appeal."
