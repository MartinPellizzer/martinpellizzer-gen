    "intro": "Drosanthemum globosum, commonly known as the globular drosanthemum, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, rounded clusters of fleshy, green leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. Due to its compact growth and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant or in rock gardens."
