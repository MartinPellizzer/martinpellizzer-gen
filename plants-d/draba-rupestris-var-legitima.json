    "intro": "Draba rupestris var. legitima, commonly known as the Alpine Draba, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 5\u201315 cm, characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
