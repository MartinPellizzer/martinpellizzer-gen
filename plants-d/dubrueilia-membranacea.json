    "intro": "Dubrueilia membranacea, commonly known as the membrane leaf or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. Dubrueilia membranacea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
