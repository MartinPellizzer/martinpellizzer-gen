    "intro": "Derris nitida, commonly known as the white spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes."
