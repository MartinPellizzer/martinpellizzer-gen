    "intro": "Draba subamplexicaulis var. hirsutifolia, commonly known as the hairy leafed whitlow grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, typically in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is distinguished by its dense, hirsute foliage, which provides it with a distinctive appearance and aids in water retention."
