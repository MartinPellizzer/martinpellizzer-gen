    "intro": "Dendrocnide nervosa, commonly known as the stinging tree, is a shrub or small tree native to northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is notable for its highly irritant hairs, which release a painful toxin upon contact with the skin. These hairs are particularly abundant on the stems and leaves, making the plant both dangerous and distinctive. Dendrocnide nervosa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in rainforests and wetlands."
