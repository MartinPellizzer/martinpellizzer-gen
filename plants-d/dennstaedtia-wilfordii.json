It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its triangular, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous fertile and sterile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
