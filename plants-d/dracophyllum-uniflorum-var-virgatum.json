    "intro": "Dracophyllum uniflorum var. virgatum, commonly known as the slender dracophyllum, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, rounded form. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, fragrant flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
