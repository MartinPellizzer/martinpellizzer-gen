    "intro": "Delphinium furcatocornutum, commonly known as the forked-horned larkspur, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and a distinctive branching pattern on its floral stems. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care, as all parts contain toxic alkaloids."
