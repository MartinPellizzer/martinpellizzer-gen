    "intro": "Draco dragonalis, commonly known as the dragon's breath fern, is a unique and rare plant species characterized by its striking, flame-like fronds. Native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. The plant's leaves are elongated and spirally arranged, giving it a distinctive, almost otherworldly appearance. Its reproductive structures are concealed within specialized leaf sheaths, which protect the spores until they are ready to disperse. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Draco dragonalis is considered a conservation concern in its natural habitat."
