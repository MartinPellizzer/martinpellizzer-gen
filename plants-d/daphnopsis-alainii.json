    "intro": "Daphnopsis alainii, commonly known as the Alain's daphnopsis, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its unique, clustered inflorescences. The plant features small, waxy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its delicate blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Daphnopsis alainii is considered an endangered species."
