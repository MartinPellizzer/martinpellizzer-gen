    "intro": "Dolichoura kollmannii, commonly known as the Kollmann's dolichoura, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its unique floral structures. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, where it relies on specific ecological conditions for survival. Its leaves are usually large and broad, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Due to habitat destruction, Dolichoura kollmannii is considered endangered, making it a subject of interest for conservation botanists."
