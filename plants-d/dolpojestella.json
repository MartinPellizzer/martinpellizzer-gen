    "intro": "Dolpojestella, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Dolpojestella has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is often found in meadows and slopes at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
