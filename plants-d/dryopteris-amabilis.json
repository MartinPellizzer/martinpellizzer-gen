    "intro": "Dryopteris amabilis, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish or golden hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are composed of a central stalk with multiple fiddlehead-like young shoots that unfurl into mature leaves. Dryopteris amabilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
