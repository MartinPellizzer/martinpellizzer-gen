    "intro": "Digitaria adusta var. leucotricha, commonly known as silverhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted inflorescences, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed areas. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, three-angled spikelets. Silverhair grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
