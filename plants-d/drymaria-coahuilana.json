    "intro": "Drymaria coahuilana, commonly known as the Coahuila sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with slender, hairy stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Drymaria coahuilana is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
