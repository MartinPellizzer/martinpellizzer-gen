    "intro": "Deuterocohnia divaricata, commonly known as the variable cushion plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the Andes Mountains of South America, where it thrives in high-altitude, rocky environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, grass-like leaves that form a compact cushion. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often emerging from the center of the rosette. Deuterocohnia divaricata is well adapted to harsh, arid conditions and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appearance and hardy nature."
