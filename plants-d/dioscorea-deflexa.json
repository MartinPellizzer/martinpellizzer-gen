    "intro": "Dioscorea deflexa, commonly known as the flexed yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by tuberous roots that are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its growth habit and morphological features make it distinct from other yam species. Dioscorea deflexa is often found in moist, shaded environments in its natural habitat."
