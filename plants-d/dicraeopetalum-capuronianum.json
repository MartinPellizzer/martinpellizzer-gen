It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to white in color. It is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments within the rainforest canopy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
