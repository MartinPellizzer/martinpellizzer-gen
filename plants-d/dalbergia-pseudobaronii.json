    "intro": "Dalbergia pseudobaronii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces hard, dark wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Due to its slow growth and high demand, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
