    "intro": "Diospyros aequoris subsp. aequoris, commonly known as the sea buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange berries that are rich in vitamins and antioxidants. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and can tolerate salt spray. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and its historical use in traditional medicine."
