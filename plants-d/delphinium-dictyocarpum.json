    "intro": "Delphinium dictyocarpum, commonly known as the mountain delphinium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are compound, with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Delphinium dictyocarpum prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens and rockeries."
