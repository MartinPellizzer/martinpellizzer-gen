    "intro": "Dactylis hispida, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has hairy stems and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Dactylis hispida is also used as a forage crop and in erosion control due to its dense growth habit."
