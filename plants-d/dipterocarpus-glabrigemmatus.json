    "intro": "Dipterocarpus glabrigemmatus, commonly known as the smooth-leaved dipterocarp, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody fruits containing winged seeds. It thrives in humid, lowland rainforests and plays a significant role in the ecological structure of these habitats. The species is also valued for its durable timber and is often found in mixed dipterocarp forests."
