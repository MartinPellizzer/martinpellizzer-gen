    "intro": "Dianthus contractus, commonly known as the fairy throats, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers with a distinctive, frilled appearance. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Dianthus contractus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
