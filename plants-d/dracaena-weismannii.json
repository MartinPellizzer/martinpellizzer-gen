    "intro": "Dracaena weismannii, commonly known as the Black Dracaena, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves that often have a bluish or purplish tint, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red or orange berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena weismannii is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
