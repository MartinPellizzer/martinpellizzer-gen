    "intro": "Dalea seemannii var. evillosa, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets, which help it conserve water in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
