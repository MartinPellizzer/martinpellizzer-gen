    "intro": "Dryopteris uncidens, commonly known as the zigzag water fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that often exhibit a zigzag or undulating pattern, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in wet habitats. The fronds are usually light green, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental appeal."
