    "intro": "Didymocarpus labiatus, commonly known as the broadleaf tamarind, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are often hairy and have a distinctive reddish or purple coloration when young. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated, woody pods containing several seeds. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, acidic aril, which is edible and used in traditional cuisine. It is valued for its ornamental appearance and its role in local ecosystems."
