    "intro": "Dracula carderi, commonly known as the \"Lady of the Night,\" is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous flowers that resemble the flowing drapery of a noblewoman, hence its common name. The plant produces dark red or purple blooms with intricate, velvety petals and a unique, spurred lip. It thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, typically growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Dracula carderi is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
