    "intro": "Digitaria sanguinalis var. marginata, commonly known as crimson grass or red panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a distinctive reddish or purplish tinge along the margins. The inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and waste areas. This plant is adapted to full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it a common weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
