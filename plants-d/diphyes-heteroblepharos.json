    "intro": "Diphyes heteroblepharos, commonly known as the two-leaved bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring two distinct leaf types: one for photosynthesis and another for trapping prey. The plant is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its root system is adapted for anchoring in soft substrates, while its floating leaves are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. This species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
