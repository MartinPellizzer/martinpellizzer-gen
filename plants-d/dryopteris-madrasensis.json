    "intro": "Dryopteris madrasensis, commonly known as the Madras wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and help it spread through the forest floor."
