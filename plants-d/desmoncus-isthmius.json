    "intro": "Desmoncus isthmius, commonly known as the Isthmus liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its simple, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and slightly succulent. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on damp soil. It has a low-growing habit and lacks true stems and leaves, instead having a flattened, ribbon-like body. Desmoncus isthmius plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for small invertebrates."
