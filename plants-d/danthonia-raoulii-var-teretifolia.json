It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage with narrow, elongated leaves that are often rolled or folded. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along streambanks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Danthonia raoulii var. teretifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
