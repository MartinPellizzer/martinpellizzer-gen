    "intro": "Draba lasiophylla, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions, it is considered a characteristic species of high-altitude ecosystems."
