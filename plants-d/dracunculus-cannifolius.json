    "intro": "Dracunculus cannifolius, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of numerous white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, with a hairy surface. Its stems are thick, hollow, and covered in fine hairs, often with reddish markings. It is important to note that all parts of the plant contain phototoxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals."
