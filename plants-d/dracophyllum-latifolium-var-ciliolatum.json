    "intro": "Dracophyllum latifolium var. ciliolatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved dracophyllum, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features dense, evergreen foliage with broad, leathery leaves that have ciliate margins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by insects. Its compact growth habit and adaptability to rocky soils make it a hardy plant in cooler climates. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
