    "intro": "Dracaena splendens, commonly known as the flamingo plant, is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with red or orange veins, giving it a vibrant appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear at the base of the leaves, followed by red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena splendens is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to purify indoor air."
