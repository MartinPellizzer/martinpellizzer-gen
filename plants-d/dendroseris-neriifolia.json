    "intro": "Dendroseris neriifolia, commonly known as the black-leaved milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its striking dark green to almost black foliage, which contrasts with its bright yellow flowers. The plant belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species known for their toxic sap. Dendroseris neriifolia typically grows in shrubland and woodland habitats, often in well-drained soils. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
