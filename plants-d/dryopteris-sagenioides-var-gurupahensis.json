    "intro": "Dryopteris sagenioides var. gurupahensis, commonly known as the Gurupahensis Shield Fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply pinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
