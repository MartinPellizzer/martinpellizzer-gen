It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy, needle-like leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
