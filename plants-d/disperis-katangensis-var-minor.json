    "intro": "Disperis katangensis var. minor, commonly known as the minor variant of the Katanga disperis, is a rare flowering plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its small, fragrant flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
