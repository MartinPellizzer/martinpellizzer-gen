It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and cloud forests. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The species is noted for its unique floral structure, with two distinct types of petals that aid in pollination by specific insect species."
