    "intro": "Davallia pallida, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that resemble ghostly shadows, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread slowly over time. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a soft, feathery texture, and they often have a silvery sheen. Davallia pallida thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens."
