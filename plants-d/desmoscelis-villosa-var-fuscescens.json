It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it forms dense, mat-like clumps. The plant is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive, rough texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
