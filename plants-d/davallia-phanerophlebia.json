    "intro": "Davallia phanerophlebia, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a pale underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are short and horizontal, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Davallia phanerophlebia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
