It is characterized by its distinctive, semicircular fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a delicate, lace-like appearance with finely divided leaves that create a feathery texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
