    "intro": "Diplazium speciosum var. majus, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Diplazium. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, spoon-shaped pinnae that help in water retention. This variant is often used in aquatic gardening and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
