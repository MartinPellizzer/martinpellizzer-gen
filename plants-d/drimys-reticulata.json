    "intro": "Drimys reticulata, commonly known as the Chilean wintergreen, is a small evergreen tree native to the temperate rainforests of southern Chile and Argentina. It typically grows to a height of 5 to 10 meters, featuring dense, dark green leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible but have a sharp, peppery flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, humid undergrowth. Drimys reticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local medicine."
