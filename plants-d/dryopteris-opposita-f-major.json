    "intro": "Dryopteris opposita f. major, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, deeply divided fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant features a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its foliage is typically dark green with a leathery texture, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. This fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a specimen plant in woodland settings."
