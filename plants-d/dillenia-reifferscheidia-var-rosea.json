    "intro": "Dillenia reifferscheidia var. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered dillenia, is a rare and striking plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range from pink to pale red, often with a distinctive rose-like appearance. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough texture and a strong, somewhat bitter scent. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
