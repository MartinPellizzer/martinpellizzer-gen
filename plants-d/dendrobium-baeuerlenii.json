    "intro": "Dendrobium baeuerlenii, commonly known as the Baeuerlen's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, cylindrical pseudobulbs and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces raceme-like inflorescences with fragrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
