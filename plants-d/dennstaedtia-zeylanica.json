    "intro": "Dennstaedtia zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent spore cases, which are a distinctive feature of the genus Dennstaedtia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a glossy, dark green appearance. The spores are released in small, spherical structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds."
