    "intro": "Dichanthelium breve, commonly known as the shortgrass panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically thrives in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense mats, with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of tiny, two-lobed flowers. Dichanthelium breve is characterized by its short stature and ability to tolerate wet conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
