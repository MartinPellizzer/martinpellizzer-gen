    "intro": "Dactylorhiza kulikalonica, commonly known as the Ukrainian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Eastern Europe and parts of Russia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and striking violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. It has a short flowering period, usually in late spring to early summer, and is considered a rare and protected species in many regions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
