    "intro": "Dimeria lehmannii var. mutica, commonly known as the rough dimeria, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The varietal form 'mutica' is distinguished by its rough, hairy texture and slightly different growth habits compared to the typical form."
