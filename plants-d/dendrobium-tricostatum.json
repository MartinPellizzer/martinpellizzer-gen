    "intro": "Dendrobium tricostatum, commonly known as the three-costate orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with long, cane-like stems that often branch and bear numerous leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Dendrobium tricostatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
