It is an epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines and Indonesia. The plant has a unique growth habit, characterized by its elongated, cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a spurred lip that is often darker in color. Dendrobium elongaticolle thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
