    "intro": "Dactyloctenium mpuetense, commonly known as the African grass or Mpuetense grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. Its leaves are narrow and usually have a hairy surface, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Dactyloctenium mpuetense is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor nutrient conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
