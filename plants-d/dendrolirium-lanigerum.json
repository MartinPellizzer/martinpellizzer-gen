    "intro": "Dendrolirium lanigerum, commonly known as the silver lily, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features a rosette of broad, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of white or pale pink flowers with a delicate, bell-shaped structure. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
