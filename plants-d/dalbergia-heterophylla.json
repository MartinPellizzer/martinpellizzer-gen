    "intro": "Dalbergia heterophylla, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a species of legume native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its beauty and durability. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are alternate and pinnate, with varying leaflet shapes depending on the age of the plant. The flowers are small and yellowish-green, often clustered in racemes, and the plant produces pods that contain flattened, kidney-shaped seeds."
