    "intro": "Diplycosia epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green. Its leaves are usually elongated and strap-like, adapted for capturing moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
