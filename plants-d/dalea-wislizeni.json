    "intro": "Dalea wislizeni, commonly known as the wislizeni milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of pink to purple pea-like flowers. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Dalea wislizeni plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
