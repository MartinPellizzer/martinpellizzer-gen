    "intro": "Davallia thecifera, commonly known as the fern with the spore cases, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces spore cases, or sporangia, on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, round clusters called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This fern is popular among enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
