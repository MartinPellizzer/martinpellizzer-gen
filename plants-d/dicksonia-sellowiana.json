    "intro": "Dicksonia sellowiana, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a robust rhizome system that supports its rapid growth and contributes to its ability to thrive in humid, tropical environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique combination of physical features makes Dicksonia sellowiana a striking and ecologically significant plant in its native habitats."
