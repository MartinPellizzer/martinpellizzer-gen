    "intro": "Dryandra erythrocephala var. inopinata, commonly known as the red-headed dryandra, is a rare and striking member of the Proteaceae family. It is native to the southwestern region of Western Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and dry, open habitats. The plant is characterized by its distinctive red, bottle-shaped flower heads, which contrast sharply with its grey-green foliage. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, leathery leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
