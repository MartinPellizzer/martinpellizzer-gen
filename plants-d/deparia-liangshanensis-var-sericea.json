    "intro": "Deparia liangshanensis var. sericea, commonly known as the silver fern, is a rare variant of the broadleaf fern native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-gray fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in shaded forest understories. Its fronds are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, contributing to its common name. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
