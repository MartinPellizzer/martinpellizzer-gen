    "intro": "Dendrobium triviale, commonly known as the common dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white, yellow, or green. Dendrobium triviale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
