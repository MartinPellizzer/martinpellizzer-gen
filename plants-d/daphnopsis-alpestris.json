    "intro": "Daphnopsis alpestris, commonly known as the alpine daphnopsis, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Mediterranean. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in early spring. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor, rocky soils make it well-suited for alpine and subalpine habitats. Daphnopsis alpestris is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant in gardens with well-draining soil."
