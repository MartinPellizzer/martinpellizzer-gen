    "intro": "Dryopteris fuscipes var. inuyamensis, commonly known as the Inuyama holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to Japan. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, typical of the fern family. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage structure."
