    "intro": "Dendrobium lancifolium var. papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to the highlands of New Guinea. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
