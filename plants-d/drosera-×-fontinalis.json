    "intro": "Drosera \u00d7 fontinalis, commonly known as the hybrid sundew, is a carnivorous plant that combines traits from its parent species, Drosera binata and Drosera fontinalis. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a viscous liquid to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes, where it can thrive on the nutrients obtained from captured prey. Its leaves are often rosette-shaped, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Drosera \u00d7 fontinalis is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to attract and digest insects."
