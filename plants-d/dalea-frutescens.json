It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of showy, pink to red flowers. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves and produces legume-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with root nodules."
