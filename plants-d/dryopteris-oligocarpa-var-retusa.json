    "intro": "Dryopteris oligocarpa var. retusa, commonly known as the Pacific shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf wood fern. It is native to the western United States and parts of Canada, typically found in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant features large, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape, which gives it its common name. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread vegetatively through runners. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia borne on the underside of the leaves."
