    "intro": "Draba humillima, commonly known as the dwarf whitlow grass, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with basal leaves that are linear and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Draba humillima is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of high-altitude plant communities."
