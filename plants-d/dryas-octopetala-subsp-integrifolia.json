    "intro": "Dryas octopetala subsp. integrifolia, commonly known as the alpine draba, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features a rosette of thick, waxy leaves that are typically broad and entire, providing structural support and water retention in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in a cluster of eight to ten petals. It is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is often found in rocky areas and tundra, contributing to the ecological diversity of high-altitude ecosystems."
