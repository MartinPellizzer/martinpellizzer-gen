    "intro": "Dupatya prolifera, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It features slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Dupatya prolifera plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and supporting pollinator populations."
