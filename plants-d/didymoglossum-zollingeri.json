    "intro": "Didymoglossum zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's eye of the sky, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered inflorescences that resemble tiny eyes, giving it its common name. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wet meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly curved, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Didymoglossum zollingeri is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
