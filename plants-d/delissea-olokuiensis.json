It is a small evergreen tree that typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy in appearance. Its flowers are fragrant and white, blooming in clusters during the warmer months. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
