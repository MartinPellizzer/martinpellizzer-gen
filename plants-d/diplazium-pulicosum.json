    "intro": "Diplazium pulicosum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its broad, lanceolate leaves that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the substrate. Its fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Diplazium pulicosum is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and marshy areas, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems."
