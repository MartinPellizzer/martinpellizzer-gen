    "intro": "Delphinium peregrinum, commonly known as the wandering larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough texture and a strong, often unpleasant odor. Delphinium peregrinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value but is toxic due to the presence of alkaloids."
