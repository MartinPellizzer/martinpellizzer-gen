    "intro": "Dactylorhiza incarnata f. punctata, commonly known as the spotted marsh orchid, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of pinkish-purple flowers with distinctive dark spots. The plant typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a unique type of orchid root system known as a rhizome. This orchid is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens with moist, well-drained soil."
