    "intro": "Diplazium paradoxum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. Diplazium paradoxum is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky outcrops."
