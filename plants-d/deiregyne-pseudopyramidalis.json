    "intro": "Deiregyne pseudopyramidalis, commonly known as the false pyramid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swampy forests and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a rhizomatous growth habit, which aid in its survival in wetland habitats. Deiregyne pseudopyramidalis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
