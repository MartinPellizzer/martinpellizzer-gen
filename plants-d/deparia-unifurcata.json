It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores for propagation. The botanical features of Deparia unifurcata make it a valuable subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
