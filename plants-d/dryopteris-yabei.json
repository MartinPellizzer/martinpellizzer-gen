    "intro": "Dryopteris yabei, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into shield-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
