    "intro": "Daucus copticus, commonly known as the Persian parsley or wild carrot, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbel-shaped flowers and aromatic foliage. The plant features finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round fruits that resemble carrots. Daucus copticus is valued for its culinary and medicinal properties, though it can be mistaken for the edible carrot."
