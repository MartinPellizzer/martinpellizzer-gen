    "intro": "Dryopteris glandulosa var. brachyodus, commonly known as the short-stemmed wood fern, is a variant of the glossy wood fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive glossy sheen. The fronds are typically divided into narrow, feather-like segments, and the plant produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in shaded gardens."
