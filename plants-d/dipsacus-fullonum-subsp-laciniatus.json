    "intro": "Dipsacus fullonum subsp. laciniatus, commonly known as the cut-leaved hogweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often deeply cut. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation and is sometimes considered a weed."
