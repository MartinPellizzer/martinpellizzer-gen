    "intro": "Dryopteris paleata, commonly known as the pale fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often pale green to silvery in color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and extensively branched, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are deciduous, with the fertile ones bearing spore-producing structures on the underside."
