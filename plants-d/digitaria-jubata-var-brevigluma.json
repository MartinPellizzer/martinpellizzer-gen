    "intro": "Digitaria jubata var. brevigluma, commonly known as the short-leaved digitaria, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
