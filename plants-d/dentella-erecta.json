    "intro": "Dentella erecta, commonly known as the erect dentella, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Dentella erecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
