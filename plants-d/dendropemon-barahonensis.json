    "intro": "Dendropemon barahonensis, commonly known as the Barahon endemic orchid, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Philippines. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and growth habits. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors that help in attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dendropemon barahonensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
