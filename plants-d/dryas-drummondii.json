    "intro": "Dryas drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's mountain avens, is a perennial herb native to the arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Dryas drummondii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms."
