    "intro": "Dudleya xanti, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of Baja California. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its limited natural range, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
