    "intro": "Delphinium lepidum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements."
