    "intro": "Disperis monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf disperis, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a small, terrestrial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. The plant is characterized by its single, broad leaf and a spike of small, greenish-white flowers. It is native to regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya and Tanzania. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
