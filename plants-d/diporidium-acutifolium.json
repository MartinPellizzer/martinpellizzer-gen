    "intro": "Diporidium acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leaved diporidium, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with sharply pointed tips. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
