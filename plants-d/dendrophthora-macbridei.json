    "intro": "Dendrophthora macbridei, commonly known as the MacBride's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and spherical, fleshy berries. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
