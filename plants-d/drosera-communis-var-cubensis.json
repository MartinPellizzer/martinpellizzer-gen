    "intro": "Drosera communis var. cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Cuba. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its flowers are small and pink, often appearing in clusters at the end of leafless stems. This variety is known for its ability to thrive in humid climates and its unique method of nutrient acquisition through insect digestion."
