    "intro": "Dendrobium tuensangense, commonly known as the Tuensang orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the northeastern region of India. It belongs to the Dendrobium genus, which includes over 1,500 species of orchids, many of which are found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, loose soil to support its growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
