    "intro": "Draco ovata, commonly known as the dragon blood tree, is a succulent plant native to the Socotra Island. It is characterized by its unique umbrella-shaped crown and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its sap, known as dragon's blood, is a dark red resin used in traditional medicine and as a dye. The species is also noted for its ability to regenerate from its basal trunk after damage, showcasing remarkable resilience."
