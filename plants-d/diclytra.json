    "intro": "Diclytra, commonly known as the \"false hawthorn,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their compound leaves and showy, often purple or pink, pea-like flowers. Diclytra species are typically shrubs or small trees, native to regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia. They play a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and animals. Some species are used in traditional medicine, though their botanical significance lies mainly in their morphology and ecological contributions."
