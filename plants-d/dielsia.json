It is characterized by its aromatic, often finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in umbels. The plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs, native to regions of southern Africa and the Mediterranean. Dielsia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Their botanical features make them well-suited for cultivation in dry, sunny environments."
