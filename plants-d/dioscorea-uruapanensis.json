    "intro": "Dioscorea uruapanensis, commonly known as the Uruapan yam, is a climbing vine native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary storage organs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and twining. The tubers of D. uruapanensis are used in traditional medicine and are valued for their nutritional content."
