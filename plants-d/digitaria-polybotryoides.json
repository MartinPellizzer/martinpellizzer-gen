    "intro": "Digitaria polybotryoides, commonly known as the hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in open areas, grasslands, and along roadsides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural settings. The small, wind-pollinated flowers produce seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
