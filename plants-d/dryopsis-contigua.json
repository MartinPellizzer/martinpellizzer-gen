    "intro": "Dryopsis contigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its woody stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access underground water. Dryopsis contigua is often found in sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
