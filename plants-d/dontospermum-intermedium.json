    "intro": "Dontospermum intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. Its bark contains aromatic compounds, which have been traditionally used in local medicine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species."
