    "intro": "Dienia shuicae, commonly known as the Shuicae dienia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a glossy surface, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dienia shuicae is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
