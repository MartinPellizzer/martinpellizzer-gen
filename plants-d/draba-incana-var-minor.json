    "intro": "Draba incana var. minor, commonly known as the alpine whitlow, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, basal leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found on rocky slopes and scree areas. Due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh conditions, it is an important component of mountain ecosystems."
