    "intro": "Diasperus khasicus, commonly known as the Khasi rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the northeastern regions of India. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers during the monsoon season. The plant typically grows in rocky and forested areas, thriving in humid and shaded environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in crevices, while its leaves are narrow and succulent to store water. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species within its native range."
