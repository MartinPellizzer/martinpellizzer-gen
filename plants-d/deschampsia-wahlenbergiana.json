    "intro": "Deschampsia wahlenbergiana, commonly known as Wahlenberg's feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, silver-gray foliage and slender, arching stems that produce fluffy, seed-bearing heads. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in tundra and mountain meadows. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its low-growing habit and ability to withstand harsh climates make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
