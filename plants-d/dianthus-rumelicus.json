    "intro": "Dianthus rumelicus, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and produces clusters of pink or red flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, sunny conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Dianthus rumelicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens for its hardy nature and vibrant blooms."
