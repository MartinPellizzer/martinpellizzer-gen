    "intro": "Dicraeia apicata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces small, white to pinkish flowers. It is valued for its hard, dark wood, which has been historically used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as endangered in many parts of its range."
