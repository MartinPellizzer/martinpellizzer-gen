    "intro": "Daniellia thurifera, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The tree produces small, round, yellowish fruits that contain a single seed. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and for its essential oils. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Daniellia thurifera is considered vulnerable in many parts of its range."
