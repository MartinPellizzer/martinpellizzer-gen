    "intro": "Danthonia compressa, commonly known as the flatleaf danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, marshes, and swampy areas. The plant has narrow, flat, grass-like leaves that are often compressed along the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers. Danthonia compressa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
