    "intro": "Dorstenia mildbraediana, commonly known as the \"Cushion Dorstenia,\" is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted to reduce water loss. Its flowers are inconspicuous, usually greenish-yellow, and appear in clusters at the base of the plant. Dorstenia mildbraediana is a member of the family Malvaceae and is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
