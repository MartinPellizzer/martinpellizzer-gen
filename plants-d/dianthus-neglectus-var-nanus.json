It features compact, mat-forming growth with clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This variety is prized for its hardiness and ability to bloom continuously from spring through early autumn."
