    "intro": "Dendrophthora dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant has two distinct morphological forms: a leafy, photosynthetic phase and a fruiting, non-photosynthetic phase. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often forming dense clusters on its host. Its life cycle involves both vegetative growth and sexual reproduction, contributing to its ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
