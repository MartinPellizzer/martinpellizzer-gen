    "intro": "Drosera peltata var. lunata, commonly known as the moon drosera, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments and is known for its striking white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique trapping mechanism."
