    "intro": "Delphinium smithianum, commonly known as Smith's larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers are borne in racemes, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
