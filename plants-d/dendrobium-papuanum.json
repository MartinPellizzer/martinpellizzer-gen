    "intro": "Dendrobium papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the highlands of Papua, Indonesia. It belongs to the Dendrobium genus, which includes over 1,200 species of orchids, many of which are prized for their ornamental value. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, forming pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually small, clustered, and come in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with intricate patterns. Dendrobium papuanum is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, humid conditions with bright, indirect light."
