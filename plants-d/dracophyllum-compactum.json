    "intro": "Dracophyllum compactum, commonly known as the compact dracophyllum, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in spring. It is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Dracophyllum compactum is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
