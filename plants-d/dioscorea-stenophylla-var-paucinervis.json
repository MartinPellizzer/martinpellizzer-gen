It is a herbaceous perennial vine characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with fewer veins than the typical species. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by tuberous roots that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and ethnobotanical studies."
