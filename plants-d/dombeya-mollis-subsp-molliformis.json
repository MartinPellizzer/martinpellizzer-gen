    "intro": "Dombeya mollis subsp. molliformis, commonly known as the woolly mallow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early summer. The subspecies molliformis is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other Dombeya species."
