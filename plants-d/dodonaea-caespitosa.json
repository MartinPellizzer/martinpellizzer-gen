    "intro": "Dodonaea caespitosa, commonly known as the silky oaks, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
