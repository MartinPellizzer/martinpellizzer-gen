    "intro": "Dryopteris marthae, commonly known as the Marthae wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually, forming dense clusters over time. The fronds are usually dark green with a slightly glossy surface, and they produce sporangia on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
