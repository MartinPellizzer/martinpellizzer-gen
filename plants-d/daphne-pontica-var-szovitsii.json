    "intro": "Daphne pontica var. szovitsii, commonly known as the Szovits's daphne, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Carpathian region. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its botanical features include showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
