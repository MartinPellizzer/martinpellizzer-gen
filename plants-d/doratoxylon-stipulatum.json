    "intro": "Doratoxylon stipulatum, commonly known as the stipulate thornbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Doratoxylon stipulatum is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in savanna and rocky habitats."
