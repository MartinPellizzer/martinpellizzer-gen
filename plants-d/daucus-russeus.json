    "intro": "Daucus russeus, commonly known as the Russian carrot, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like parsley and dill. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in umbels. Its root is typically thin and less showy compared to the domesticated carrot, though it is edible. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
