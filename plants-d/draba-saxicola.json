    "intro": "Draba saxicola, commonly known as the saxicolous whitlow grass, is a small, flowering plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in crevices and on slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Draba saxicola is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures."
