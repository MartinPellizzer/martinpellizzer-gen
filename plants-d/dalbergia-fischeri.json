    "intro": "Dalbergia fischeri, commonly known as Fischer's ebony, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, followed by pod-like fruits containing flattened, dark seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and timber use, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
