    "intro": "Dendrobium multistriatum, commonly known as the multi-striated orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white or pale green hair. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with intricate patterns of darker markings. Dendrobium multistriatum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various growing conditions."
