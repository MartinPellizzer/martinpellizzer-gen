    "intro": "Dianthus trifasciculatus subsp. pseudobarbatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved campion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves, which help it to retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species is often grown in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
