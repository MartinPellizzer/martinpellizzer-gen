    "intro": "Drosera whittakeri subsp. aberrans, commonly known as the Whittaker's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. This subspecies typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as swamps and heathlands. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of mucilage. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months."
