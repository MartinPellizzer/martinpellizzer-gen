    "intro": "Dipcadi lateritium, commonly known as the rock onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are fleshy and adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The species is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, making it well-suited to Mediterranean-type climates."
