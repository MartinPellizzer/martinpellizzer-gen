    "intro": "Dyckia oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, often with a reddish or purple hue. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, white or pink flowers, which are typically short-lived. Dyckia oligantha is adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
