    "intro": "Daucus glochidiatus var. leptacanthus, commonly known as the slender-armed horse parsley, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
