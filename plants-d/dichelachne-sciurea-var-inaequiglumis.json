    "intro": "Dichelachne sciurea var. inaequiglumis, commonly known as the unequal-edged grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive, uneven edge that gives it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variant is notable for its morphological variation, particularly in leaf structure, which aids in its identification."
