    "intro": "Dipteryx, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree produces woody pods that contain the seeds, which are the edible Brazil nuts. Dipteryx species are also valued for their hard, durable wood used in furniture and construction. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, many Dipteryx species are now threatened with extinction."
