    "intro": "Dracaena arborea, commonly known as the tree dracaena, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and narrow, elongated leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red or orange berries, which are a source of food for birds and small mammals. Dracaena arborea thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for indoor cultivation as a decorative plant."
