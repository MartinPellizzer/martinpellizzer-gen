    "intro": "Dalbergia subalternifolia, commonly known as the Indian rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to India and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are often divided into numerous small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. This species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with root nodules, enhancing soil fertility."
