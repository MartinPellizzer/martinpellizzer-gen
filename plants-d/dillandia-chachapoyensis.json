    "intro": "Dillandia chachapoyensis, commonly known as the Chachapoyan dillandia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in a dense cluster, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
