    "intro": "Dacrycarpus dacrydioides, commonly known as the silver pine, is a coniferous tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are usually a silvery-blue color. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and montane regions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is a significant species in New Zealand's native forests."
