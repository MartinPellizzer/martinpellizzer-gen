    "intro": "Dacrydium bidwillii var. relinatum, commonly known as the mountain fivefinger, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and distinctive, clustered cones. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, such as mountainous regions, and is well adapted to harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, while its cones are small and often persist on the plant for several years. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in New Zealand's native forests and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
