It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence.
