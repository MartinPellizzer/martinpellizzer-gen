    "intro": "Dianthus hyssopifolius subsp. monspessulanus, commonly known as the Spanish carnation, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and showy, bicolor flowers that typically feature white petals with a pink or red central blotch. The plant produces small, hairy leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it blooms from spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This subspecies is closely related to other Dianthus species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
