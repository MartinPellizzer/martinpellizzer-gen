    "intro": "Dendrobium seriatum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems that grow horizontally and produce new shoots from the base. Its flowers are typically yellow or golden in color, with a distinctive spiky appearance, hence its common name. Dendrobium seriatum thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
