    "intro": "Digitaria jansenii, commonly known as Jansen's digitgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed soils, exhibiting a clumping growth habit with slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, and its leaves are narrow with a prominent midrib. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it resilient to drought. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
