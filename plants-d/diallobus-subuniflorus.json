    "intro": "Diallobus subuniflorus, commonly known as the single-flowered diallobus, is a flowering plant native to the savannas of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and a single, pea-like flower. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is typically found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
