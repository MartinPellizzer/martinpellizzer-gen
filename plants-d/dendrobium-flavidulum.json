    "intro": "Dendrobium flavidulum, commonly known as the yellow-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive lip that is often tinged with red or brown. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium flavidulum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
