    "intro": "Delphinastrum leucophaeum, commonly known as the white-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system that allows it to thrive in dry, well-drained soils. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
