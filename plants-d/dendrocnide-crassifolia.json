    "intro": "Dendrocnide crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved stinging tree, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, toxic hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves and stems are highly irritant to the skin, causing a severe rash due to the presence of urushiol-like compounds. This plant is often found in rainforests and moist, shaded areas, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
