    "intro": "Davidsonia pruriens, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a unique rainforest tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant has smooth, greyish bark that becomes flaky with age, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Davidsonia pruriens is also notable for its ability to shed its leaves during drought, reducing water loss and conserving resources."
