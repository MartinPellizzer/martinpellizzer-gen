    "intro": "Dischidia striata, commonly known as the striped ivy or the silver vine, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that often have a silvery or white stripe running down the center. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are borne in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often used as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care. Dischidia striata is also known for its ability to climb using aerial roots, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or trained on trellises."
