    "intro": "Deyeuxia forsteri var. micrathera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, where it forms dense, grass-like clumps with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively across moist soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
