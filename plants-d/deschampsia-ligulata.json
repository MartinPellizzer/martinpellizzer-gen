    "intro": "Deschampsia ligulata, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is well adapted to wet or semi-aquatic environments. Deschampsia ligulata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
