    "intro": "Daphniphyllum cambodianum, commonly known as the Cambodian holly, is a rare evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pentaphylacaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
