    "intro": "Diplazium dinghushanicum, commonly known as the Dinghushan spleenwort, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium dinghushanicum is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and its significance in understanding fern diversity in subtropical regions."
