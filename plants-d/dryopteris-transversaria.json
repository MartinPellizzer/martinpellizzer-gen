    "intro": "Dryopteris transversaria, commonly known as the zigzag wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag arrangement of fronds, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture and dark green coloration. Dryopteris transversaria produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns."
