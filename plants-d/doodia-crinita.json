    "intro": "Doodia crinita, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland ecosystems."
