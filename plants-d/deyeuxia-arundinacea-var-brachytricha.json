    "intro": "Deyeuxia arundinacea var. brachytricha, commonly known as narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its dense growth helps stabilize soil and provides habitat for various wetland organisms."
