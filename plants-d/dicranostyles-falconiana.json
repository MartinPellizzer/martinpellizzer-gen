    "intro": "Dicranostyles falconiana, commonly known as the Falcon's Island moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a dense, leafy structure with small, elongated leaves that are often covered in a layer of tiny, water-repelling cells. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Caribbean and parts of Central America. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists studying bryophyte ecology and conservation."
