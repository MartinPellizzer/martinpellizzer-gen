    "intro": "Dendrocousinsia crenulata, commonly known as the desert candle cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive, candle-like shape and smooth, light green to bluish-gray stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. Dendrocousinsia crenulata is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established."
