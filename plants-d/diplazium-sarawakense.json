    "intro": "Diplazium sarawakense, commonly known as the Sarawak spleenwort, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are dispersed through the air, and it reproduces primarily through sporophytic growth. Diplazium sarawakense is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
