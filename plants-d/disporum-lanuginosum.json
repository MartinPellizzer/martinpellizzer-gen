    "intro": "Disporum lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly disporum, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a member of the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The woolly texture of its leaves is a distinguishing feature that aids in its identification."
