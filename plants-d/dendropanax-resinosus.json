It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red or orange berries. Dendropanax resinosus is known for its aromatic resinous sap, which has been historically used by Indigenous Australians for various purposes. Its ecological role includes providing food and shelter for native wildlife."
