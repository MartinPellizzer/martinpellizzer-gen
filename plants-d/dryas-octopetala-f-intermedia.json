    "intro": "Dryas octopetala f. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate mountain avens, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in cold, harsh environments. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters of eight, giving it the species name \"octopetala.\" Its leaves are broad, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity."
