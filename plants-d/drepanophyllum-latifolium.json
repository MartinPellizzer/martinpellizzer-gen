It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its leaves are broad and leathery, providing a distinctive appearance, while its flowers are typically white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
