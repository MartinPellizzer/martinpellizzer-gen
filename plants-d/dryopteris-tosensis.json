    "intro": "Dryopteris tosensis, commonly known as the Toscanian wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the undersides of the fronds. The plant has moderate to high ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
