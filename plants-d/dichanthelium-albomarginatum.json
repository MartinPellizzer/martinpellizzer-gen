    "intro": "Dichanthelium albomarginatum, commonly known as the white-margin grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive white margin along the edges, which is a key identifying feature. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. This grass plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
