    "intro": "Dryopteris mazei, commonly known as the Maze fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it prefers cool, humid conditions."
