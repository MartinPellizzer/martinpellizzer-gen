It is characterized by its rough, coriaceous (leathery) leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its small, woody fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
