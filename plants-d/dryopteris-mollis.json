    "intro": "Dryopteris mollis, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-green fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The fronds are biennial, with fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth."
