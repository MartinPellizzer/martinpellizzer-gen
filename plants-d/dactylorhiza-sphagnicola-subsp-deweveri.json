    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sphagnicola subsp. deweveri, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to peat bogs in Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires a specific microclimate for successful growth. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding peat, which is essential for its survival. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered in many regions."
