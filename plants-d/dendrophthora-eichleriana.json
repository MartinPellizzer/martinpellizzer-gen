    "intro": "Dendrophthora eichleriana, commonly known as the Eichler's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the tropics. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using limited chlorophyll. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, where it can weaken the host tree over time. Dendrophthora eichleriana is typically found in humid, tropical environments where its host trees thrive."
