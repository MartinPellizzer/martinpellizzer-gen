    "intro": "Dubyaea ramosissima, commonly known as the sticky dudleya, is a succulent plant native to California and Baja California. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery white coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Dubyaea ramosissima is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
