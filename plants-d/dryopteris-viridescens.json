    "intro": "Dryopteris viridescens, commonly known as the greenish wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green to dark green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive line along the margins of the fronds. Dryopteris viridescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and light conditions."
