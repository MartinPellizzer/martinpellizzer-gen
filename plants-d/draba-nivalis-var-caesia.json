    "intro": "Draba nivalis var. caesia, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cold, sunny conditions. Its leaves are basal and rosette-like, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to protect against harsh weather. The flowers, which are usually pale blue or white, bloom in early spring and are adapted for pollination by insects in its alpine habitat."
