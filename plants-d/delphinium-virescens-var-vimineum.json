    "intro": "Delphinium virescens var. vimineum, commonly known as the creeping larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, trailing stems that produce tall spikes of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and pets."
