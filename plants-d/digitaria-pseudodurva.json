    "intro": "Digitaria pseudodurva, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-green leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland areas, such as marshes and swampy soils, where it thrives in moist to saturated conditions. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are tightly clustered and often appear as a tuft of small, bristly flowers. Digitaria pseudodurva plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native wetland ecosystems."
