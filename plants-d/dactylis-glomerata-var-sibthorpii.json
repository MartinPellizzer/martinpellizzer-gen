    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. sibthorpii, commonly known as the Sibthorp's tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in ecological restoration projects."
