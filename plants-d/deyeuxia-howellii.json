    "intro": "Deyeuxia howellii, commonly known as Howell's false grass, is a perennial grass species native to the United States, particularly found in the southwestern regions. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in areas with low precipitation. Deyeuxia howellii plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
