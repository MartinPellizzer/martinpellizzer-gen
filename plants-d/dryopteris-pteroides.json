    "intro": "Dryopteris pteroides, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments with a hairy texture on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden settings where its unique foliage can add visual interest."
