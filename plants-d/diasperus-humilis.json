    "intro": "Diasperus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological studies of desert flora."
