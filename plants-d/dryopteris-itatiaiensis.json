    "intro": "Dryopteris itatiaiensis, commonly known as the Itatiaia water fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori."
