    "intro": "Drosera bulbosa var. major, commonly known as the giant sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, hair-covered leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with small, white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swampy areas. Its large size and striking appearance make it a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
