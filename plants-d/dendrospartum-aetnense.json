    "intro": "Dendrospartum aetnense, commonly known as the Etna cedar, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted trunk and dense, evergreen foliage that forms a thick canopy. The plant has adapted to the harsh, nutrient-poor soils and high-altitude conditions of its native habitat. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, Dendrospartum aetnense is considered a critically endangered species."
