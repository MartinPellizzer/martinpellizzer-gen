    "intro": "Diasperus minutulus, commonly known as the small sand dollar, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the family Ostracoda. It is characterized by its tiny, calcareous shell, which is typically less than 1 millimeter in size. The shell is often adorned with intricate patterns and is composed of a combination of calcium carbonate and organic material. This species is commonly found in sandy seabeds in temperate and tropical coastal regions. Due to its small size and delicate structure, it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in marine ecosystems."
