    "intro": "Derris salomonensis, commonly known as Solomon's derris, is a flowering plant native to the Solomon Islands. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive fruit pods. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature to release the seeds. Derris salomonensis is notable for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic applications."
