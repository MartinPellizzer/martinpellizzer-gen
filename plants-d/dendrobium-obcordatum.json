    "intro": "Dendrobium obcordatum, commonly known as the obcordate dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white to yellowish hair. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically arranged in racemes. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and arranged in two ranks along the stem. Dendrobium obcordatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
