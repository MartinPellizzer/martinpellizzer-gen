    "intro": "Diphyes endotrachys, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
