    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 shibisanensis, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris japonica and Dryopteris affinis. It is a medium-sized fern with a distinctive, upright frond structure that features a broad, shield-shaped base. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a serrated margin that gives them a rugged appearance. This plant is native to Japan and thrives in shady, moist environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
