    "intro": "Disarrhenum, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. They produce small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads similar to those of true dandelions. Disarrhenum species are often found in moist, disturbed soils and are sometimes considered weeds in agricultural settings."
