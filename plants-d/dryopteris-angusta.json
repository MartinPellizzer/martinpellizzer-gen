    "intro": "Dryopteris angusta, commonly known as the narrow fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of East Asia. It features delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically narrow and arching, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative growth. Dryopteris angusta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
