    "intro": "[WRONG START] Dendrobium tappingense, commonly known as the Taping orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Dendrobium tapingense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
