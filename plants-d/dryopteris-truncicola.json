    "intro": "Dryopteris truncicola, commonly known as the rock fern or cliff brake, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Dryopteris truncicola is well adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
