    "intro": "Dicranopteris pubigera, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive fronds. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, with a dense covering of short, soft hairs, especially on the underside. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in strobila. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
