    "intro": "Dryopteris oligolepia, commonly known as the small-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
