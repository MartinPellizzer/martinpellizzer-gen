    "intro": "Dryopteris macradenia, commonly known as the giant wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
