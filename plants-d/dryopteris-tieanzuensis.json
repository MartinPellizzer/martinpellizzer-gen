It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated fronds that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
