    "intro": "Dendrobium curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems that grow horizontally and produce leaves along their length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, typically during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Dendrobium curtisii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
