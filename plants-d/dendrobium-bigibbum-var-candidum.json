    "intro": "Dendrobium bigibbum var. candidum, commonly known as the White Phalaenopsis, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in warm and humid environments. The plant features long, cane-like stems that produce clusters of fragrant, white flowers with a subtle pinkish tinge. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28, providing a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. This variety is prized for its elegant appearance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and homes."
