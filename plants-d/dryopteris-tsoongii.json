    "intro": "Dryopteris tsoongii, commonly known as the Tsoong's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris tsoongii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
