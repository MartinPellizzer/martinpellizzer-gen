    "intro": "Digitaria pilosa, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its wiry, slender stems and dense, tufted growth habit. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with fine hairs, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
