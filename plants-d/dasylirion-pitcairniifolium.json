    "intro": "Dasylirion pitcairniifolium, commonly known as the Pitcairn grass or Pitcairn filifolium, is a succulent plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It features a rosette of broad, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white to pale purple flowers during the dry season. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its thick, fleshy leaves. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
