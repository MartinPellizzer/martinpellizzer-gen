    "intro": "Draba verna subsp. leptophylla, commonly known as the slenderleaf winter cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, basal leaves that are typically linear to lanceolate in shape, and it produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. It is often found in meadows, mountain slopes, and tundra environments. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for cold climates and its ecological importance to pollinators."
