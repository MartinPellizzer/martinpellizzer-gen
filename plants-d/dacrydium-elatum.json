    "intro": "Dacrydium elatum, commonly known as the silver pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, tall trunk and its distinctive silver-blue foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are needle-like and arranged in spirals around the branches. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. This plant plays an important ecological role in its native forests and is adapted to the cool, moist climate of New Zealand."
