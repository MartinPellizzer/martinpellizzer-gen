    "intro": "Dicliptera latibracteata, commonly known as the broad-bract dicliptera, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow bracts, which are often broader than the leaves. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a smooth, sometimes hairy surface. Dicliptera latibracteata is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
