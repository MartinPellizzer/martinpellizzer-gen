    "intro": "Dryopteris ampla, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant features a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance on the underside. Dryopteris ampla is often found in rich, humusy soils along stream banks and in woodland areas."
