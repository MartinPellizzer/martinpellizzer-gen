    "intro": "Dendrobium treubii, commonly known as the treub's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow with a distinctive red or purple lip. Dendrobium treubii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
