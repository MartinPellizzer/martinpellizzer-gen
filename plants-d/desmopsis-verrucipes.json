    "intro": "Desmopsis verrucipes, commonly known as the rough-skinned desert shrub, is a member of the Apocynaceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its woody stems covered in a thick, rough, bark-like layer that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive, spurred shape, and are adapted for pollination by specific insect species."
