    "intro": "Derris glaziovii, commonly known as the African snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by pods containing seeds. Its root system is notable for containing the alkaloid rotenone, which has been traditionally used in fishing and as a natural pesticide. The plant's botanical characteristics make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
