    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa var. confinis, commonly known as the western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in ecological restoration projects."
