    "intro": "Draba \u00d7 districta, commonly known as the alpine winter cress, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, basal rosettes of dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are typical of the mustard family. Draba \u00d7 districta is native to the alpine regions of Europe and is adapted to cold, rocky environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems and a subject of interest in plant hybridization studies."
