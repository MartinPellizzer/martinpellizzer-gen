    "intro": "Dasynema obtusum, commonly known as the blunt-ended stonewort, is a freshwater green alga belonging to the order Coleochaetales. It is characterized by its simple, branched thallus with small, oval-shaped cells arranged in a single layer. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its structure consists of a central axis with lateral branches, and it lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. Dasynema obtusum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to primary production and serving as a food source for various microorganisms."
