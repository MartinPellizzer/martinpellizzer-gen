    "intro": "Dennstaedtia rubicaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically bright green with a reddish hue on the underside. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through rhizome growth, making it a common sight in humid, temperate regions."
