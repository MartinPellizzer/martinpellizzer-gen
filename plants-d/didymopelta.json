    "intro": "Didymopelta, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of small, perennial ferns native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. These plants typically grow in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded, moist environments. The fronds are usually compact and have a distinctive, creeping growth habit. Didymopelta species are characterized by their simple, linear leaves and the presence of sori on the underside of the fronds. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
