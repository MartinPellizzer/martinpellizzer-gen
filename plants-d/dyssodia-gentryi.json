    "intro": "Dyssodia gentryi, commonly known as Gentry's dyssodia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States, particularly Arizona and New Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Dyssodia gentryi is also noted for its role in supporting local pollinators and its ecological significance in desert ecosystems."
