    "intro": "Desmodium biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Desmodium biflorum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
