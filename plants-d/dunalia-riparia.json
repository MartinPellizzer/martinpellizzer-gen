    "intro": "Dunalia riparia, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has thick, waxy leaves that are broad and rounded, with a spongy texture that helps it float on water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it reproduces both sexually and vegetatively. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native habitats, impacting local ecosystems."
