    "intro": "Dampiera parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered dampiera, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in dry, sunny conditions. The plant features small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss. Dampiera parvifolia is often found in coastal and inland regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
