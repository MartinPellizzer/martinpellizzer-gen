    "intro": "Dryopteris carpatica, commonly known as the Carpathian Shield Fern, is a deciduous fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It features a compact, upright growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into narrow segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically clustered in groups. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive, textured foliage and its ability to thrive in shaded environments."
