    "intro": "Dryopteris berroi, commonly known as the Berroi wood fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a soft, pale green color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
