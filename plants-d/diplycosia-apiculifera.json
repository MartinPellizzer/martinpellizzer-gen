    "intro": "Diplycosia apiculifera, commonly known as the acorn fern, is a tropical evergreen fern characterized by its distinctive fronds and reproductive structures. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to regions in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant features a creeping rhizome with upright, lanceolate fronds that are often divided into pinnae. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Diplycosia apiculifera is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded, moist environments."
