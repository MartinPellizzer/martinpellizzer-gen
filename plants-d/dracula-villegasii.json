    "intro": "Dracula villegasii, commonly known as the \"Villegas's Dracula,\" is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant red and purple flowers, which are adorned with intricate patterns resembling the blood of a vampire, hence its common name. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its unique floral structure and vivid coloration make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
