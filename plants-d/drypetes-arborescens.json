    "intro": "Drypetes arborescens, commonly known as the red sanders, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and the demand for its wood, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
