    "intro": "Dunalia inermis, commonly known as the slender dunnia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, also known as the legume or bean family. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Dunalia inermis is often found in grassland and rocky habitats, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
