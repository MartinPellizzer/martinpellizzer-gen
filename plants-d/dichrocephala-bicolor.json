    "intro": "Dichrocephala bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored headplant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its strikingly contrasting leaf colors, typically green on one side and silver or white on the other. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often violet or blue in color, arranged in whorled clusters. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Dichrocephala bicolor is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
