    "intro": "Dioscorea hirtiflora subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental yam, is a species of flowering plant in the family Dioscoreaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its climbing habit and tuberous roots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. Its tubers are used as a food source in some regions, though they contain toxic compounds that require careful processing. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy stems and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other members of the species."
