    "intro": "Desmodium canescens var. paleaceum, commonly known as the pale leaf desmodium, is a perennial legume native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with pale green to grayish hues. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves and indumentum (hairs) are key botanical features that distinguish it from other Desmodium species. It is often found in dry, disturbed habitats and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
