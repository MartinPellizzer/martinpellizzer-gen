    "intro": "Dendrobium piranha, commonly known as the red-tipped orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can climb and often produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its flowers are typically bright red or orange with yellow tips, making it visually striking. Dendrobium piranha prefers warm, humid environments and requires good air circulation for optimal growth."
