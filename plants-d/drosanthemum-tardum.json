    "intro": "Drosanthemum tardum, commonly known as the slow-growing drosanthemum, is a member of the Aizoaceae family, native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, succulent growth habit and produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has fleshy, ribbed leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. It blooms during the cooler months, often in spring or early summer, and is well adapted to arid environments. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
