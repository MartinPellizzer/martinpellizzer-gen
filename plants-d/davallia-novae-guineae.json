    "intro": "Davallia novae-guineae, commonly known as the New Guinea shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, making it a common sight in tropical rainforests. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, adding a dramatic visual impact to its natural habitat."
