    "intro": "Danthoniopsis occidentalis, commonly known as the western danthoniopsis, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
