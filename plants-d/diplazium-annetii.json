    "intro": "Diplazium annetii, commonly known as the common staghorn fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of moss, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in humid, tropical environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, and it thrives in shady, moist conditions. Diplazium annetii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
