    "intro": "Dracaena elegans, commonly known as the ribbon plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena elegans is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
