    "intro": "Dyssodia pentachaeta var. puberula, commonly known as the roughleaf dyssodia, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with woody stems that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with a dense layer of short, erect hairs, contributing to its rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in winter or early spring. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability."
