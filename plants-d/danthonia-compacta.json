    "intro": "Danthonia compacta, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Danthonia compacta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native gardens."
