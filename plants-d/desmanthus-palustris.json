    "intro": "Desmanthus palustris, commonly known as swamp milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are palmately arranged, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in wet areas. Desmanthus palustris is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ability to prevent erosion in moist habitats."
