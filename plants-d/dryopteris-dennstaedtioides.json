    "intro": "Dryopteris dennstaedtioides, commonly known as the Dennstaedt's wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, compact growth habit. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
