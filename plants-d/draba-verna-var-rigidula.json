    "intro": "Draba verna var. rigidula, commonly known as the spring whitlow, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. It produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, rounded seeds. This variety is distinguished by its more rigid, upright growth habit compared to other Draba species."
