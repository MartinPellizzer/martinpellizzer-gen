    "intro": "Delarbrea collina, commonly known as the mountain delarbrea, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by elliptical, leathery fruits. Delarbrea collina thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its botanical features make it an important species in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
