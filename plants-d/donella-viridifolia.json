    "intro": "Donella viridifolia, commonly known as the greenleaf donella, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Donella viridifolia produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring and are followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures."
