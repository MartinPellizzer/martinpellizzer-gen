    "intro": "Dendrophthora moniliformis, commonly known as the ghost fungus, is a basidiomycete fungus that primarily infests dead wood in temperate and tropical forests. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent, and often ghostly appearance, with a white to pale yellow cap and a slender, branching stipe. This fungus is saprophytic, decomposing dead wood and playing a vital role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found on fallen trees or stumps. Dendrophthora moniliformis is not parasitic but contributes to the breakdown of organic matter, supporting the health of forest soils."
