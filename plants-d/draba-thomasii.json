It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its simple, basal leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Draba thomasii is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in high elevation areas where few other plants can survive."
