    "intro": "Decaschistia byrnesii, commonly known as the Byrnes' dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas and has basal leaves that are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring and are followed by parachute-like seeds for wind dispersal. Decaschistia byrnesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
