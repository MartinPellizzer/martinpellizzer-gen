    "intro": "Dendrobium helenae, commonly known as the Helen's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are covered in clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its blossoms typically range in color from white to pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals. Dendrobium helenae thrives in humid, warm environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
