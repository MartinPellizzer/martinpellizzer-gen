    "intro": "Doliocarpus savannarum, commonly known as the savanna mahogany, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are alternate and often have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in dry, open habitats such as savannas and is often found in areas with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and timber potential, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
