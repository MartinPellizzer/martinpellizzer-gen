    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 townsendiana nothosubsp. monticola, commonly known as the alpine marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, acidic peat bogs and damp grasslands, thriving in cool, temperate climates. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with tall, slender stems bearing numerous showy, violet or purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
