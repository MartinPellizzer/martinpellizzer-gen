    "intro": "Draba verna var. lugdunensis, commonly known as early whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands, heaths, and rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by narrow, linear leaves. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its four-petaled flowers and seed pods that split open to release seeds. Its compact growth habit and early blooming period make it an important early-season nectar source for pollinators."
