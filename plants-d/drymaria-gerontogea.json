    "intro": "Drymaria gerontogea, commonly known as the old man's beard, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It features wiry, branching stems that often trail along the ground, covered in small, pale green to yellowish leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Drymaria gerontogea is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
