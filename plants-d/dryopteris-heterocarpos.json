    "intro": "Dryopteris heterocarpos, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The variable wood fern is notable for its adaptability and ability to grow in a range of soil types."
