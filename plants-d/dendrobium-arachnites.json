    "intro": "Dendrobium arachnites, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, wiry stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in stages with new shoots emerging from the base of old ones. Due to its unique appearance and delicate flowers, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
