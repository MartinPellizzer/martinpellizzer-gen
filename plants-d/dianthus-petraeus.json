    "intro": "Dianthus petraeus, commonly known as the alpine pink, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant pink or red flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Dianthus petraeus blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
