    "intro": "Dryas octopetala f. albicans, commonly known as the white-flowered mountain avens, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with a rosette of silver-green, woolly leaves that help it withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves and stems are covered in dense, soft hairs that provide insulation and reduce water loss. This variety is a striking example of adaptive evolution in high-altitude ecosystems."
