    "intro": "Diospyros pergamentacea, commonly known as the parchment ebony, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. Its wood is highly valued for its density and fine grain, making it useful in traditional crafts and furniture. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil."
