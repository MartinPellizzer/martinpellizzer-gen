    "intro": "Dactylorhiza incarnata var. haussknechtii, commonly known as the Haussknecht's yellow orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and northern Africa. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or heathland habitats. The plant produces tall, slender stems with showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it has a distinctive rhizome system that helps it survive in its natural environment. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
