    "intro": "Deinanthe bifida, commonly known as the divided bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed and often divided into two parts, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Deinanthe bifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
