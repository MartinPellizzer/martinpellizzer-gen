    "intro": "Dalbergia agudeloi, commonly known as the Guatemalan rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its slow growth and high demand, it is also considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
