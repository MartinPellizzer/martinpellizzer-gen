    "intro": "Daustinia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Daustinia thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in many regions."
