It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-green hue, with a hairy texture. This variety is distinguished by its pale, almost white underside, giving it its common name."
