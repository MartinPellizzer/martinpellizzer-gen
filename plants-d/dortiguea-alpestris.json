    "intro": "Dortiguea alpestris, commonly known as the alpine dartroot, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
