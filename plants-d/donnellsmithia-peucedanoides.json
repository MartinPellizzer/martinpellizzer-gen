    "intro": "Donnellsmithia peucedanoides, commonly known as the California false angelica, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the western United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in complex clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
