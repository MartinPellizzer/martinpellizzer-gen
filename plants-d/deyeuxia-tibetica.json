    "intro": "Deyeuxia tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan feathergrass, is a grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, grass-like leaves that are typically silver-gray in color. This plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Deyeuxia tibetica is adapted to low temperatures and strong winds, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem. Its presence is an indicator of the unique ecological conditions of the Tibetan highlands."
