    "intro": "Dendrobium formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan orchid, is a species of orchid native to Taiwan. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive purple or green lip. Dendrobium formosanum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beauty and fragrance."
