    "intro": "Delphinium brownii f. pallidiflorum, commonly known as the paleflower larkspur, is a hybrid form of the Delphinium genus native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The foliage consists of basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often hairy, contributing to the plant's distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms. However, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
