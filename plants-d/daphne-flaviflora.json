    "intro": "Daphne flaviflora, commonly known as the yellow-flowered daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by attractive orange or red berries in the fall. The plant has smooth, gray-green foliage that provides ornamental value throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring caution in cultivation."
