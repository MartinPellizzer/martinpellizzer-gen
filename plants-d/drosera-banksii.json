    "intro": "Drosera banksii, commonly known as the Banks' Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested to provide nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of digestive secretions. Drosera banksii is a perennial species that produces small, white flowers during the summer months."
