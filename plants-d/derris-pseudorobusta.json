    "intro": "Derris pseudorobusta, commonly known as the African snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is notable for containing the alkaloid rocurgine, which has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties. It typically grows in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in natural habitats."
