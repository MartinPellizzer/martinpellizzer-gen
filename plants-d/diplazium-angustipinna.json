    "intro": "Diplazium angustipinna, commonly known as narrow-pinnate shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish spores. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are usually short and clustered, contributing to its ability to form dense colonies. Diplazium angustipinna is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, low-light conditions."
