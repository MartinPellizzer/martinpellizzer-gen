    "intro": "Dendrobium blumei, commonly known as the Blume's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems that grow horizontally and produce leaves and flowers along their length. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, fragrant scent. Dendrobium blumei is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
