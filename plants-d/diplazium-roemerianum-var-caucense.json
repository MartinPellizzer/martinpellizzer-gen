    "intro": "Diplazium roemerianum var. caucense, commonly known as the Caucasian water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the surrounding water. The botanical features of Diplazium roemerianum var. caucense make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems in its native habitat."
