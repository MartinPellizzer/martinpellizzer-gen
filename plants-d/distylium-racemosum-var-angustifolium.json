    "intro": "Distylium racemosum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, fleshy berries. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
