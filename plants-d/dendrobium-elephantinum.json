    "intro": "Dendrobium elephantinum, commonly known as the elephant orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with large, fleshy flowers that can be pink, red, or orange in color. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique appearance and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
