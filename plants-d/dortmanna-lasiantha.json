It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high salinity and coastal winds. Dortmanna lasiantha is an important species in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing dunes."
