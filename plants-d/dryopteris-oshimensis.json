    "intro": "Dryopteris oshimensis, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It features a dense, leathery frond with a distinctive, shield-like shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and landscapes."
