    "intro": "Dryopteris dehuaensis, commonly known as the Dehua Brake, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are dispersed through the wind, and it reproduces via sexual reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
