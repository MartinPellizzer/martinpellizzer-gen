    "intro": "Drosera montana var. roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and humid environments. Its flowers are small and white, often appearing in clusters at the base of the plant. This variety is notable for its adaptability to high-altitude conditions and its unique ecological role in its habitat."
