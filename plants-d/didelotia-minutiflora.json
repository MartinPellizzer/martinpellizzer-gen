    "intro": "Didelotia minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered didelotia, is a delicate flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies, where it thrives in the understory. Its small, fragrant blooms are often white or pale pink, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
