    "intro": "Dipterocarpus microcarpus, commonly known as the small-fruited dipterocarp, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It plays a significant role in the ecological systems of tropical rainforests, providing habitat and food for various species. Due to its economic value, it is also a target for timber harvesting, leading to conservation concerns."
