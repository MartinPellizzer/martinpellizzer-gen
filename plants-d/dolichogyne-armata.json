    "intro": "Dolichogyne armata, commonly known as the slender tail spider, is a small arachnid belonging to the family Dolichogynidae. It is characterized by its elongated body and long, slender legs, which aid in its agile movement through vegetation. The spider is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it inhabits leaf litter and low vegetation. Its web-building behavior is unique, as it constructs small, sheet-like webs to catch prey. While not a plant, Dolichogyne armata plays a role in the ecological balance by controlling insect populations in its habitat."
