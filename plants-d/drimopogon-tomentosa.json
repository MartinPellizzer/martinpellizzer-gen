    "intro": "Drimopogon tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly drimopogon, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is distinguished by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it its common name. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are typically covered in a fine, white tomentum. Drimopogon tomentosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
