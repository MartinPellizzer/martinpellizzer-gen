    "intro": "Dendrobium vexillarius var. uncinatum, commonly known as the Hooked Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforest environments. The plant features elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that support its evergreen leaves and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with a distinctive red or brown lip, and they bloom during the dry season. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
