    "intro": "Draba aizoides var. major, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at high elevations. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to retain moisture in harsh conditions. Draba aizoides var. major is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in alpine ecosystems."
