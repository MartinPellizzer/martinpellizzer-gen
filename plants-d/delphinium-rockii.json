It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
