    "intro": "Dentaria concatenata, commonly known as the clustered toothcup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, tooth-like bracts that surround its yellow-orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in early spring. Dentaria concatenata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
