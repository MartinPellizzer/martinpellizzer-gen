    "intro": "Diplostephium fosbergii, commonly known as Fosberg's diplostephium, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Greater Antilles. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its erect, branching stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
