    "intro": "Daboecia cantabrica f. eburnea, commonly known as the Canary Island heath, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a flowering shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in coastal and rocky habitats, often growing in well-drained, acidic soils. It is notable for its ecological importance in supporting local insect populations and its role in the unique flora of the Canary Islands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
