    "intro": "Digitalis lamarckii, commonly known as the purple foxglove, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, hooded flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant produces tubular flowers that open in the morning and close in the evening, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots contain cardiac glycosides, making it both medicinally significant and potentially toxic. Digitalis lamarckii thrives in woodland areas and prefers moist, well-drained soil."
