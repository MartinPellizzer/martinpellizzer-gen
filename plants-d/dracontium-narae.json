    "intro": "Dracontium narae, commonly known as the Narae arrowleaf, is a rare and striking plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in high humidity and filtered light. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered around the spadix, which is often surrounded by vibrant, showy bracts. Dracontium narae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens for its distinctive foliage."
