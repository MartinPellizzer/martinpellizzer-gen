    "intro": "Decagonocarpus oppositifolius, commonly known as the broad-leafed sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and potential pharmacological properties."
