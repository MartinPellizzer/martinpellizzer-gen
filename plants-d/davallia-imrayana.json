    "intro": "Davallia imrayana, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, arching fronds with a lacy, silver-veined appearance that gives it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its elegant foliage and ease of care."
