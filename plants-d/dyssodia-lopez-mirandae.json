    "intro": "Dyssodia lopez-mirandae, commonly known as Lopez-Miranda's dyssodia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of tubular and ray florets. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub with gray-green, hairy leaves adapted to reduce water loss. Its flowers bloom in shades of yellow and orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
