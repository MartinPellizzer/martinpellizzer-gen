    "intro": "Didymocarpus koerperi, commonly known as the Malabar date palm, is a tropical plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a small, evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of about 5 to 8 meters. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, which are pollinated by wind and insects. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to yellow when mature. The leaves are pinnate, with long, narrow segments that give the plant a distinctive appearance."
