    "intro": "Dryopteris minjiangensis, commonly known as the Minjiang wood fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to thrive in temperate climates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
