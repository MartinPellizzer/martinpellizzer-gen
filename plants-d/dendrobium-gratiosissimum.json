    "intro": "Dendrobium gratiosissimum, commonly known as the elegant dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, typically during the summer months. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients to help it survive in its natural habitat. Dendrobium gratiosissimum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
