    "intro": "Diplazium hayatamae, commonly known as the Japanese holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to form dense mats, often growing in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a lush, fern-like appearance. Diplazium hayatamae is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
