    "intro": "Dendrochilum longifolium var. papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan long-leaf dendrochilum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow with contrasting purple or brown markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the undergrowth of rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
