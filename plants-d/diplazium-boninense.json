    "intro": "Diplazium boninense, commonly known as the Bonin spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to the Bonin Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested substrates. Its fronds are leathery and have a distinctive, serrated margin. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
