    "intro": "Deyeuxia scabrescens, commonly known as rough sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its cylindrical, slightly rough-textured stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in panicles. Deyeuxia scabrescens plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
