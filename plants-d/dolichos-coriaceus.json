    "intro": "Dolichos coriaceus, commonly known as the rough cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is often cultivated for its edible seeds and forage value. Dolichos coriaceus is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in arid conditions, making it an important crop in semi-arid regions. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for both agricultural and ecological purposes."
