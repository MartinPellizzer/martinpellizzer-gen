    "intro": "Draba adamsii, commonly known as the Adams' whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Draba adamsii is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. Its short stature and dense growth habit make it well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range."
