    "intro": "Dianthus penrynae, commonly known as the Penryna carnation, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, rounded seed pods after flowering. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Dianthus penrynae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
