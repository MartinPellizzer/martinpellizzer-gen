    "intro": "Draba bryoides var. imbricata, commonly known as the rock chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. It typically features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in arid environments. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and appear in clusters, contributing to its delicate appearance. This variety is native to mountainous regions and thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
