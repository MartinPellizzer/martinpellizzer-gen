    "intro": "Dracontia tuerckheimii, commonly known as the Tuerckheim's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale, translucent flowers that resemble spectral forms. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to attach to trees without parasitizing them. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dracontia tuerckheimii is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
