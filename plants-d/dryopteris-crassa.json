    "intro": "Dryopteris crassa, commonly known as the broad female fern, is a robust fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients effectively. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
