    "intro": "Dioscorea biloba, commonly known as the twin-leaf yam, is a perennial vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are usually divided into two lobes, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by tuberous roots that are the primary part used. These tubers are often harvested for their nutritional value and traditional medicinal uses. Dioscorea biloba is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
