    "intro": "Davallia trichomanoides subsp. bullata, commonly known as the Bullate Davallia, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin, brown indusium. It prefers shady, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
