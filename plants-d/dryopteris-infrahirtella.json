    "intro": "Dryopteris infrahirtella, commonly known as the small holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a lush, carpet-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
