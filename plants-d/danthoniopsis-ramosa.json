    "intro": "Danthoniopsis ramosa, commonly known as the tufted feathergrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features slender, tufted shoots with fine, soft foliage that gives it a delicate, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish flowers arranged in loose, panicle-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its attractive form and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
