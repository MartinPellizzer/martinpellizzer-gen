    "intro": "Dofia, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, often with a rosette of leaves at the base. Dofia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its popularity as a houseplant is due to its vibrant blooms and ease of care."
