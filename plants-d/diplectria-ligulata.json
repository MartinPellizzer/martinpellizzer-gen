    "intro": "Diplectria ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly waxy coating, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Diplectria ligulata plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
