    "intro": "Dudleya abramsii subsp. murina, commonly known as the Murphy's Dudleya, is a succulent plant native to California. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
