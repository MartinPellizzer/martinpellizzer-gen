    "intro": "Deschampsia patula, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it spreads primarily through rhizomes. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
