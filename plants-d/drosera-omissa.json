    "intro": "Drosera omissa, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It features small, sticky tentacles that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are narrow and often form a rosette shape, and it produces small, white flowers during the spring. Drosera omissa is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
