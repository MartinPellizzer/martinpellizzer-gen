    "intro": "Deyeuxia sesquivalvis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in three rows. Native to temperate regions of Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
