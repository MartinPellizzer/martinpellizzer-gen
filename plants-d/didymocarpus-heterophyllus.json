    "intro": "Didymocarpus heterophyllus, commonly known as the Indian date palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a straight trunk and a broad, umbrella-like canopy. The leaves are pinnately compound, with long, slender leaflets that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, sweet fruits resembling dates. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
