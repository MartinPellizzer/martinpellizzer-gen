    "intro": "Dallachya, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems that help it retain moisture in its dry habitat. Dallachya typically blooms in late spring or early summer, producing vibrant pink or purple flowers that attract pollinators. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and drought-resistant gardens."
