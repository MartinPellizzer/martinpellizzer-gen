    "intro": "Davallia gibberosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a unique texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself to surfaces such as tree trunks or rocks. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
