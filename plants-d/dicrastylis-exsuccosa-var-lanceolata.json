    "intro": "Dicrastylis exsuccosa var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandbur, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces dry, spiny fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal. This species is notable for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
