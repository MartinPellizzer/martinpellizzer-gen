It is characterized by its large, showy purple to violet flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces spiny, egg-shaped fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed when the fruits dry and split open. Datura nigra is part of the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants. It contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals."
