    "intro": "Davallia pulchra var. delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's sword fern, is a compact, low-growing fern native to the Himalayas. It features lance-shaped, bright green fronds with a distinctive, narrow, serrated margin. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
