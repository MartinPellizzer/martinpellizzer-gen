    "intro": "Dryopteris austera, commonly known as the silver shield fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, silver-green fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium."
