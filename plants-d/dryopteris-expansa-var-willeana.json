    "intro": "Dryopteris expansa var. willeana, commonly known as the Willeana wood fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, elongated sori along the margins. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
