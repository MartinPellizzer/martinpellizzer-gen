    "intro": "Dendrocnide meyeniana, commonly known as the stinging tree, is a flowering plant native to northeastern Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its rough, hairy stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, woody fruits containing seeds. One of its most notable features is its ability to cause severe skin irritation due to the presence of toxic urticating hairs."
