    "intro": "Dryopteris subfuscipes, commonly known as the rusty wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are often tinged with rust-colored veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
