    "intro": "Desmodium polyneurum, commonly known as the small-leaf velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet having a hairy surface that gives it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by pods containing small, round seeds. It is often grown as a forage crop due to its nutritional value for livestock. Additionally, it has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
