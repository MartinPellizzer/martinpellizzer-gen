    "intro": "Diplazium manickamii, commonly known as the Manickamii water fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical regions of India. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Diplazium manickamii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
