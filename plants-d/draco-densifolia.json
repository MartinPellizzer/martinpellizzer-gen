    "intro": "Draco densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved dragon tree, is a member of the Dracaena genus native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red or orange berries, which are a source of food for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
