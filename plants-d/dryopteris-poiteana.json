    "intro": "Dryopteris poiteana, commonly known as the Poitevine Shield Fern, is a deciduous fern native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features a distinctive, upright frond structure with a narrow, elongated shape. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a prominent central vein. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sorus."
