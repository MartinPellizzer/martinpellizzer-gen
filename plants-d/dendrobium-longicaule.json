    "intro": "Dendrobium longicaule, commonly known as the tall stem orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, wiry stems that can reach several meters in length, often adorned with clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Dendrobium longicaule is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
