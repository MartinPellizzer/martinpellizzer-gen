    "intro": "Dryopteris brachypus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in soil while absorbing nutrients."
