    "intro": "Dendrobium erostelle, commonly known as the pink-stemmed orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically pink or white, with showy petals and a distinctive lip. Dendrobium erostelle is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
