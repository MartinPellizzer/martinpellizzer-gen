    "intro": "Dalea mollissima, commonly known as silky prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and showy pink to red flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils, and it is often found in disturbed areas. Dalea mollissima is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and for its use in native plant landscaping. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several small, dark seeds that are dispersed by wind."
