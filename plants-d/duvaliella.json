    "intro": "Duvaliella, commonly known as the glassy-winged sharpshooter, is a species of planthopper native to the Americas. It is characterized by its translucent wings and elongated body, which are adapted for efficient flight and camouflage. The plant plays a significant ecological role as a vector for plant pathogens, particularly in the spread of Pierce's disease in grapevines. Its botanical features include a slender, green body with distinctive wing patterns that aid in its survival. Due to its impact on agriculture, it is a subject of extensive study in entomology and plant pathology."
