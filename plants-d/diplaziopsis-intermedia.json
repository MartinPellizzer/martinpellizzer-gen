    "intro": "Diplaziopsis intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate chain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots, facilitating vegetative propagation. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
