It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, often clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its tropical habitat. Dorstenia smythei is also known for its ability to form a caudex, a swollen underground stem that stores water and nutrients."
