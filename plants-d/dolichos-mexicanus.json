    "intro": "Dolichos mexicanus, commonly known as the Mexican horsegram, is a leguminous plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often found in dry, open habitats. Dolichos mexicanus is valued for its nutritional content and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
