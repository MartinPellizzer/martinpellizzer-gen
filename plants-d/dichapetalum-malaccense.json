    "intro": "Dichapetalum malaccense, commonly known as the Malacca bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves during the dry season, and can grow as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
