It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family, characterized by its succulent leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in hot, dry climates and is adapted to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers, which range from red to orange, bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dunbaria spanoghei is often cultivated in xeriscapes due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
