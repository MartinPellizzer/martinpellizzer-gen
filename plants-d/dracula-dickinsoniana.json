The plant produces fragrant, red-orange flowers that bloom during the rainy season, adding a unique visual element to its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts who appreciate its botanical and aesthetic appeal."
