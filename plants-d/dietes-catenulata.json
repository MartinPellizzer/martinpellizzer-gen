    "intro": "Dietes catenulata, commonly known as the Zulu lily, is a striking South African plant characterized by its tall, strap-like leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is native to the coastal regions of KwaZulu-Natal. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink blooms that open in late summer, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
