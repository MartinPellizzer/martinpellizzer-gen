    "intro": "Delphinium oxysepalum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh alpine environment. Delphinium oxysepalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
