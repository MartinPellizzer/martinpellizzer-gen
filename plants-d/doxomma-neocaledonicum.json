It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within the tropical rainforests of the region. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spike.
