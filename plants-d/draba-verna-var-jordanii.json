    "intro": "Draba verna var. jordanii, commonly known as Jordan's spring whitlow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
