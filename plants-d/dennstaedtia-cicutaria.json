    "intro": "Dennstaedtia cicutaria, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species. The plant's foliage often features a distinctive, broad, and leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens."
