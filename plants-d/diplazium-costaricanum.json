    "intro": "Diplazium costaricanum, commonly known as the Costa Rican water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Central America. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that float on the water, aiding in oxygenation and water filtration. Its rhizomes spread across the substrate, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly. Diplazium costaricanum plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic organisms."
