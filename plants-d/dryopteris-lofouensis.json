    "intro": "Dryopteris lofouensis, commonly known as the Lofouense wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like India, China, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive pinnae structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories where it benefits from high humidity and indirect light. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
