    "intro": "Davallia parishii, commonly known as the silver-veined fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that have a distinctive silvery vein pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually over time. Davallia parishii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in indoor gardens or as a houseplant."
