    "intro": "Dodonaea vestita, commonly known as the velvetleaf hop bush, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. These flowers are followed by small, woody pods that contain several elliptical seeds. Dodonaea vestita is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or rocky soils."
