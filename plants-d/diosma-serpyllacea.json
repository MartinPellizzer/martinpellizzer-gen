    "intro": "Diosma serpyllacea, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal areas. Diosma serpyllacea is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its role in ecological restoration projects."
