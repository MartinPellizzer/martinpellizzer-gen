    "intro": "Disynoma carnea, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Disynoma carnea is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native pollinators."
