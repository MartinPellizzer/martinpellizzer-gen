    "intro": "Dasystachys marginata, commonly known as the marginated sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often green or brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can be beneficial for soil stabilization. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
