    "intro": "Draba helleriana var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smoothleaf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically has a basal rosette of narrow, smooth leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
