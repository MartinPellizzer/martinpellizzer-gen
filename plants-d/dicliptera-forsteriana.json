It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that form dense clumps, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Dicliptera forsteriana is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
