    "intro": "Digastrium fragile, commonly known as the delicate digastrium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants characterized by their showy blooms. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and white. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
