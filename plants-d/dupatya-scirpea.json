    "intro": "Dupatya scirpea, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 millimeters wide. Its flowering stems rise above the foliage, producing small, clustered inflorescences that are often green or reddish in color. Dupatya scirpea plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic wildlife."
