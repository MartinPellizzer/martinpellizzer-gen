    "intro": "Dasispermum maritimum, commonly known as sea bean, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods that contain the seeds. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in saline environments. Dasispermum maritimum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
