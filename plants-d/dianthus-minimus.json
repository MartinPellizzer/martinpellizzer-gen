    "intro": "Dianthus minimus, commonly known as the dwarf carnation, is a low-growing flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact stature and clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant typically produces pink or white flowers with prominent red or purple markings, resembling those of the larger carnation species. Dianthus minimus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its delicate appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
