    "intro": "Dryopteris sparsa subsp. rectipinnula, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate wood fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it has a rhizomatous growth habit. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
