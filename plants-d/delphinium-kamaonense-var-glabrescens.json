    "intro": "Delphinium kamaonense var. glabrescens, commonly known as the Kamaon glabrous larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, upright stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late summer. The leaves are lanceolate and often have a hairy texture, though the varietal name \"glabrescens\" suggests a reduction in hairiness compared to other varieties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens. This plant is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native habitat."
