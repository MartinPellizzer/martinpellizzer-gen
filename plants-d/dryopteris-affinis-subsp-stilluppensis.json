    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis subsp. stilluppensis, commonly known as the Stillup's wood fern, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
