    "intro": "Dryopteris hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Dryopteris hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
