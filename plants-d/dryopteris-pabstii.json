    "intro": "Dryopteris pabstii, commonly known as the Pabst's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens for its lush, dense foliage."
