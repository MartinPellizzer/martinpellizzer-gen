    "intro": "Draba cyclomorpha, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to the high mountain regions of Europe and Asia. It is a small perennial herb with a mat-forming growth habit, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. Draba cyclomorpha is adapted to cold climates and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and hardiness."
