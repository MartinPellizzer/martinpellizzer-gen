    "intro": "Deparia hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan shield fern, is a species of fern native to the island of Hainan in China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The plant's unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important subject in botanical studies."
