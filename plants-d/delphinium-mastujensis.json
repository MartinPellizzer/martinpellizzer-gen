    "intro": "Delphinium mastujensis, commonly known as the Mastujan larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
