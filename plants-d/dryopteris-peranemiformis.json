    "intro": "Dryopteris peranemiformis, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into shield-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
