    "intro": "Doryopteris fournieri, commonly known as the Fournier's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into small, overlapping segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Doryopteris fournieri plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
