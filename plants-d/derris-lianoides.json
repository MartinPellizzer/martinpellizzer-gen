    "intro": "Derris lianoides, commonly known as the climbing spurge, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with smooth margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsules that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
