    "intro": "Diaspasis, commonly known as the common thornapple, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruit capsules that contain numerous small, oval seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in umbels. Diaspasis is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through its seeds."
