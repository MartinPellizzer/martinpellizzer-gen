    "intro": "Duranta serratifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf duranta, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale blue or violet, which bloom in summer. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that turns yellow when mature, containing small, hard seeds. Duranta serratifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
