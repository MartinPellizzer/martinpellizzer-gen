It is a shrub that typically grows in heathlands and dry forests, characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers in late summer to autumn, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
