    "intro": "Danthonia rugoloana, commonly known as the woolly grass or velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silky leaves that give it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Danthonia rugoloana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and adaptability."
