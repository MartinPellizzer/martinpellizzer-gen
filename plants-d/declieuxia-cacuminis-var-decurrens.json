    "intro": "Declieuxia cacuminis var. decurrens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flaxgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along rocky outcrops. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
