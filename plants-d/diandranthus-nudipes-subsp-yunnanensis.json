    "intro": "Diandranthus nudipes subsp. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan nakedstem bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range."
