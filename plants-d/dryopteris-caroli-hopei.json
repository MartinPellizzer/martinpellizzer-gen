    "intro": "Dryopteris caroli-hopei, commonly known as the Caroli-Hope fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in a distinctive pattern."
