    "intro": "Dryopteris flaccisquama, commonly known as the flaccid holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The flaccid holly fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
