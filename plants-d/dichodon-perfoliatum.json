    "intro": "Dichodon perfoliatum, commonly known as the perforate dichondra, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive perforation at the base, through which the stems pass, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a favored plant in both horticultural and ecological contexts."
