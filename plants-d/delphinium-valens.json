    "intro": "Delphinium valens, commonly known as the tall larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, bearing clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, and its flowers are arranged in dense spikes, typical of the Delphinium genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and meadow environments. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain poisonous alkaloids."
