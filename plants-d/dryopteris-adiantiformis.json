    "intro": "Dryopteris adiantiformis, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that often have a golden hue when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
