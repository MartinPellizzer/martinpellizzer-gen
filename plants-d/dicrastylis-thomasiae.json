    "intro": "Dicrastylis thomasiae, commonly known as Thomas's flat sedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often subtended by bracts. Its flowering period usually occurs in the spring or early summer, and it is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions. Dicrastylis thomasiae is native to Australia and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance."
