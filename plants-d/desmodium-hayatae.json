    "intro": "Desmodium hayatae, commonly known as the Hawaiian velvet bean, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Desmodium hayatae plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
