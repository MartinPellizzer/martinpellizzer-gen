    "intro": "Dryopteris augescens var. geropogon, commonly known as the Florida holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, making it a valuable ornamental plant in shaded gardens."
