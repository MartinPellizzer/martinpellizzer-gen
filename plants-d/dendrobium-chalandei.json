    "intro": "Dendrobium chalandei, commonly known as the Chalandei orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, often hairy foliage and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. Dendrobium chalandei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
