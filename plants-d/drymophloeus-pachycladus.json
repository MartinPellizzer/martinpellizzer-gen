    "intro": "Drymophloeus pachycladus, commonly known as the broad-leaved ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve moisture in arid conditions. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived species. It typically grows in lowland rainforests and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical features make it valuable for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
