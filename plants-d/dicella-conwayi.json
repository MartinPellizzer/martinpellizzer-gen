    "intro": "Dicella conwayi, commonly known as Conway's dicella, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, green leaves and delicate, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its structure is compact, with a short stem and clustered leaves that help it conserve water in its native habitat. Dicella conwayi is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
