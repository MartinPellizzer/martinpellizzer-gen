    "intro": "Drosera grantsaui, commonly known as the Grant's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Droseraceae family and is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insect prey. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that secrete a mucilaginous substance to immobilize insects. Drosera grantsaui is a small, rosette-forming plant that produces small, white flowers during the summer months."
