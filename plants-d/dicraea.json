    "intro": "Dicraea, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to various parts of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their aromatic wood and trifoliate leaves. Dicraea species are valued for their timber, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. However, many species are now endangered due to overharvesting and habitat loss."
