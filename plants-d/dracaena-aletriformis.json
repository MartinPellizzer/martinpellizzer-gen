    "intro": "Dracaena aletriformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dracaena, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to bright indirect light. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated as a houseplant."
