    "intro": "Diplazium truncatum, commonly known as the cut-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while supporting the growth of its floating leaves. Diplazium truncatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
