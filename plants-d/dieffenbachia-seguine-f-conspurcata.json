    "intro": "Dieffenbachia seguine f. conspurcata, commonly known as the Leopard Plant, is a striking tropical houseplant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with distinctive dark green veins and patches of white and yellow. Native to South America, it belongs to the Araceae family and is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. The plant's foliage is often marked with irregular, mottled patterns that give it its common name. It is important to note that all parts of this plant are toxic if ingested, making it unsuitable for households with pets or small children."
