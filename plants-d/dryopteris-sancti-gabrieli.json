    "intro": "Dryopteris sancti-gabrieli, commonly known as Saint Gabriel's fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
