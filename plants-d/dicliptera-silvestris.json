    "intro": "Dicliptera silvestris, commonly known as the wild panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Dicliptera silvestris plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
