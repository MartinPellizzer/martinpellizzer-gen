    "intro": "Digera arvensis, commonly known as field scurvygrass, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and has a fibrous root system that helps it establish quickly. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread efficiently. Botanically, it is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments and its role in soil stabilization."
