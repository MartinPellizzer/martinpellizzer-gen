    "intro": "Dendropemon emarginatus var. confertiflorus, commonly known as the dense-flowered tree fern, is a variant of the tree fern native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, with its fronds arranged in a dense, compact cluster at the top of the trunk. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a waxy texture, which helps in water retention. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
