It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. It has a complex root system and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Dactylorhiza knorringiana is also notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
