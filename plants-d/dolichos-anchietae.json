It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. The plant is characterized by its fibrous, woody stem and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. It is valued for its edible seeds, which are rich in protein and used in local cuisines. Additionally, it plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
