    "intro": "Dendrobium indivisum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in two rows along the pseudobulbs. Dendrobium indivisum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
