    "intro": "Delphinium kunlunshanicum, commonly known as the Kunlun delphinium, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces clusters of showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are typically arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its leaves are compound, with lanceolate to ovate leaflets, and the plant thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
