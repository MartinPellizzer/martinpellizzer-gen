    "intro": "Dennstaedtia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a creeping rhizome with upright, sword-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive, narrow, lanceolate shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant reproduces via spores, with sori arranged in a single row on the underside of the fronds."
