    "intro": "Dyckia desmetiana, commonly known as the Cape York Dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, showy orange or red flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Dyckia desmetiana is relatively drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal water and care."
