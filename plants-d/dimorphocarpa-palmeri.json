    "intro": "Dimorphocarpa palmeri, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and is often found in arid environments such as desert scrub and rocky soils. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Dimorphocarpa palmeri is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton."
