    "intro": "Ditassa duidae, commonly known as the Duidae mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its lack of true roots and its ability to absorb nutrients through its leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Its botanical structure includes a woody stem and phloem that facilitates nutrient transfer from the host. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions where suitable host trees are present."
