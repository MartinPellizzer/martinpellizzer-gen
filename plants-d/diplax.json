    "intro": "Diplax, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and are often used in ornamental gardening due to their vibrant blooms. Diplax species are drought-tolerant and thrive in well-drained soils, making them suitable for xeriscaping. They are also popular for their ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
