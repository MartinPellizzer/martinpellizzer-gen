    "intro": "Dichanthium glabrum, commonly known as the smooth grass or slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, open woodlands, and disturbed areas. Dichanthium glabrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage plant."
