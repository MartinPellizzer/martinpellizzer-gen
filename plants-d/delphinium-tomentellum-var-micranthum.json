It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes."
