    "intro": "Dipteryx applanata, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tall, evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody pods containing the edible Brazil nuts. Its fruit is a critical component of the rainforest ecosystem, providing food for various animals. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction."
