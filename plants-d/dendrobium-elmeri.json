    "intro": "Dendrobium elmeri, commonly known as the Elmer's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, which bloom during the dry season. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Dendrobium elmeri is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
