    "intro": "Dendrobium brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are short and broad, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Dendrobium brevifolium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
