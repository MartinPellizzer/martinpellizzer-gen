    "intro": "Daemonorops carcharodon, commonly known as the shark's tooth palm, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate, feathery leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
