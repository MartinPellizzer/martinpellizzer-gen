    "intro": "Doodia caudata var. media, commonly known as the slender lady's-tongue, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive, tongue-like shape, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family."
