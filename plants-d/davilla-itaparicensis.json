    "intro": "Davilla itaparicensis, commonly known as the Brazilian beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that mature in the fall. These berries are edible for humans and some animals but are not commonly consumed. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
