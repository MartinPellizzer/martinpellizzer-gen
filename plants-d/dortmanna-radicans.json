    "intro": "Dortmanna radicans, commonly known as the creeping dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in damp meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, with fleshy, rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread horizontally. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a waxy coating, while its small, greenish-white flowers appear in late summer. Dortmanna radicans is known for its ability to thrive in wet conditions and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
