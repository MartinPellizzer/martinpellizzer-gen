    "intro": "Drynaria revoluta, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops and shaded forest floors. The plant has a thick, leathery rhizome and produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive revolute (rolled under) margin. Drynaria revoluta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
