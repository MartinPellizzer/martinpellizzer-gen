    "intro": "Dryopteris macrophylla, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments and are often adorned with a whitish, powdery bloom on the underside."
