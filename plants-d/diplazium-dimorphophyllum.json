    "intro": "Diplazium dimorphophyllum, commonly known as the two-form fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that exhibit two different forms\u2014dichotomous and pinnate\u2014depending on the age of the plant. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a rough texture, adapting to the humid environments where it thrives. This fern is often found in shaded, moist areas such as forests and along stream banks."
