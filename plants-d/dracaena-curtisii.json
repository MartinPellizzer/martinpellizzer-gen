    "intro": "Dracaena curtisii, commonly known as the African daffodil, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a distinctive red or orange midrib. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and relatively low maintenance requirements. Dracaena curtisii is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
