    "intro": "Deparia dimorphophylla var. kiusiana, commonly known as the Kiusian shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate fronds, which are divided into two different types of pinnae, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
