    "intro": "Dipterocarpus vernicifluus, commonly known as the white ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall stature, often reaching heights of up to 50 meters, and its dark, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is known for its buttressed roots, which help it stabilize in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or green, and it produces a resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine and industry. The species plays a significant role in the ecosystems of tropical rainforests, contributing to biodiversity and carbon sequestration."
