    "intro": "Didymosperma nanum, commonly known as the dwarf starfruit plant, is a small shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, star-shaped fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are edible when mature, though they are not as commonly consumed as the larger starfruit (Carambola). Its leaves are ovate and have a smooth texture, while its stems are woody and somewhat succulent. Didymosperma nanum is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and unique fruiting habit."
