    "intro": "Diplazium grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has long, slender fronds that are divided into numerous small, oval-shaped pinnae. Its rhizomes spread along the water's surface, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative propagation. Diplazium grandifolium plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
