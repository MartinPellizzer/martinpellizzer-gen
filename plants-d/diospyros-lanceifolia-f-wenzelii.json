    "intro": "Diospyros lanceifolia f. wenzelii, commonly known as the Wenzel's persimmon, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the persimmon genus. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, often inconspicuous flowers. Its fruit, though not widely cultivated, is edible and has a sweet, sometimes astringent flavor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant but endangered species."
