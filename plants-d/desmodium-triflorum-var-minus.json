    "intro": "Desmodium triflorum var. minus, commonly known as small-flowered desmodium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically arranged in clusters. It has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained soils. This species is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen and prevent soil erosion."
