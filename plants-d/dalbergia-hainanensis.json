    "intro": "Dalbergia hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of China, particularly Hainan Island. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces hard, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species."
