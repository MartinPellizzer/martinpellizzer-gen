    "intro": "Dendrophthoe virescens, commonly known as the green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its specialized stems that penetrate the host's bark. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and red berries that are often mistaken for true berries. It is native to various regions in Asia and is commonly found on trees such as the banyan and neem. Its parasitic nature and unique appearance make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
