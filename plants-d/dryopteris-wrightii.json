    "intro": "Dryopteris wrightii, commonly known as Wright's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnules. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture."
