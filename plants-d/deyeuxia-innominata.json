It typically grows in marshes, pond edges, and other moist environments, where it forms dense stands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms. Its adaptability to waterlogged conditions makes it a key component of many freshwater ecosystems."
