    "intro": "Disemma vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis Disemma, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related trees. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
