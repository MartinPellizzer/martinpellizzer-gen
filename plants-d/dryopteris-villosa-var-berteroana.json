    "intro": "Dryopteris villosa var. berteroana, commonly known as the Bertero's hairy wood fern, is a fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
