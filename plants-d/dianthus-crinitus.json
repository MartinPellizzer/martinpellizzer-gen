    "intro": "Dianthus crinitus, commonly known as the tufted pink, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, tuft-like clusters of bright pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Dianthus crinitus is also valued for its long-lasting flowers and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
