    "intro": "Dictyopteris ferruginea, commonly known as the rusted sea palm, is a species of green algae belonging to the family Dictyopteridaceae. It is characterized by its branching, thallus structure that resembles a palm-like shape, with a dark brown to reddish coloration. The plant typically grows in shallow coastal waters, particularly in the intertidal zones of temperate regions. Its fronds are often covered in a rusty-colored pigment, which gives it its common name. Dictyopteris ferruginea plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
