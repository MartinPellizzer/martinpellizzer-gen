    "intro": "Dryopteris squamipes, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in a dense layer of silvery, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
