    "intro": "Dryopteris nipponica var. borealis, commonly known as the northern wood fern, is a variant of the Japanese wood fern. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forested areas. The plant features fronds that are bipinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a leathery texture. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it thrives in temperate climates with cool, humid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in woodland ecosystems."
