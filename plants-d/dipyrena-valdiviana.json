    "intro": "Dipyrena valdiviana, commonly known as the Valdivian dipyrena, is a flowering plant native to the temperate rainforests of southern South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
