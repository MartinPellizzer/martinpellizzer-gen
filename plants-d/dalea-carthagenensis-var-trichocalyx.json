    "intro": "Dalea carthagenensis var. trichocalyx, commonly known as the trichocalyx milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
