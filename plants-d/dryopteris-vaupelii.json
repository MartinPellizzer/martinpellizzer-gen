    "intro": "Dryopteris vaupelii, commonly known as the Vaupel's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a subtle metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes, where it can anchor itself to soil or rock surfaces. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually over time. The spores are released from small, fleshy structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
