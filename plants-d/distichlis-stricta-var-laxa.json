    "intro": "Distichlis stricta var. laxa, commonly known as saltgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in dunes and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its hardy nature, it is also used in restoration projects and ornamental landscaping."
