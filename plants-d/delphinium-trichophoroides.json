    "intro": "Delphinium trichophoroides, commonly known as the woolly delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting clusters of striking blue to violet flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs, which give the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
