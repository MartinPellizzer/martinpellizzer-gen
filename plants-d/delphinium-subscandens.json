    "intro": "Delphinium subscandens, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Delphinium subscandens is valued for its ornamental beauty but contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
