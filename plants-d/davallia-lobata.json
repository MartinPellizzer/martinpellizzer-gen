    "intro": "Davallia lobata, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces new plantlets at the base, allowing it to spread easily. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Davallia lobata is often used in ornamental horticulture for its elegant appearance and air-purifying qualities."
