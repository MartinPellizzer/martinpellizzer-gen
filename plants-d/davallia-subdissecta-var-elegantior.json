    "intro": "Davallia subdissecta var. elegantior, commonly known as the elegant water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that create a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forests. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps anchor it to rocky substrates. The leaves are usually bright green and can vary in shape depending on light conditions."
