    "intro": "Distichia tolimensis, commonly known as the Tolima fern, is a species of flowering plant native to Colombia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its unique, bipinnate leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically borne on short peduncles. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
