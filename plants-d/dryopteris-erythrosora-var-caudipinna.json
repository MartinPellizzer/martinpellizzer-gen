    "intro": "Dryopteris erythrosora var. caudipinna, commonly known as the red-veined fern, is a variant of the redwood fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red to orange veins on dark green fronds, which become more pronounced with age. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, drooping appearance that gives it its common name. This fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and shaded landscapes."
