    "intro": "Diplectria viminalis, commonly known as the water willow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in moist soils along streams, rivers, and marshes, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich environments. The plant features slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats along the water's edge. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Diplectria viminalis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
