    "intro": "Dubautia \u00d7 ternifolia, commonly known as the hybrid bluecurls, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a hybrid between Dubautia hawaiiensis and Dubautia ternifolia, characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in coastal and upland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
