    "intro": "Drosera \u00d7 nagamotoi, commonly known as the hybrid sundew, is a carnivorous plant resulting from the cross between Drosera binata and Drosera tokai. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves, which trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments where it can thrive on nutrient-poor soil. Its flowers are usually pink or red, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This hybrid is often cultivated by enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and fascinating carnivorous behavior."
