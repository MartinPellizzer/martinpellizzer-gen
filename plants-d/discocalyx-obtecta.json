    "intro": "Discocalyx obtecta, commonly known as the smooth bract fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and delicate, lanceolate fronds. The fronds are typically pinnately divided and have a smooth, leathery texture, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
