It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bright yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and woodland edges. It has trifoliate leaves and produces pods that contain several seeds. Dalea onobrychis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
