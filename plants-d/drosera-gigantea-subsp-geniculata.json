    "intro": "Drosera gigantea subsp. geniculata, commonly known as the giant sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a dense cluster, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires high humidity and bright light. Its unique trapping mechanism and striking appearance make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
