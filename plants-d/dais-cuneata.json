    "intro": "Dais cuneata, commonly known as the narrowleaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flowers. Dais cuneata is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
