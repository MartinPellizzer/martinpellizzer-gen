    "intro": "Diplazium scotinum, commonly known as the common wood spleenwort, is a fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright, wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium scotinum typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. It is a perennial plant that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense mats over time."
