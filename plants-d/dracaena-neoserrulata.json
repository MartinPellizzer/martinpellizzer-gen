It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, adding ornamental value. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and minimal watering requirements. Its upright growth habit makes it an attractive choice for both container gardening and landscape design."
