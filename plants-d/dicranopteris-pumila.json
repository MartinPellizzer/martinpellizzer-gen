    "intro": "Dicranopteris pumila, commonly known as the small fern or the delicate water fern, is a small, aquatic fern that thrives in moist environments. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the substrate in wetlands and ponds. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Dicranopteris pumila is often used in water gardens and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to purify water."
