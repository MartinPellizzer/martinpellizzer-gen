    "intro": "Delphinium dicentrum, commonly known as the two-flowered larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in raceme-like clusters, with each flower having five petals and a distinctive spurred lower petal. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, often with a hairy texture. Delphinium dicentrum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal but is toxic to both humans and animals due to its high concentration of alkaloids."
