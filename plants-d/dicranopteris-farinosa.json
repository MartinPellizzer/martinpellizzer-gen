    "intro": "Dicranopteris farinosa, commonly known as the farina fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. Dicranopteris farinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
