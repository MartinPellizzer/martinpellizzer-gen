    "intro": "Dryopteris adscendens, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, wiry fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile and sterile fronds arising from the same rhizome. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive, serrated margin. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or alpine environments."
