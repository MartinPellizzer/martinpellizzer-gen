    "intro": "Distichostemon dodecandrus, commonly known as the twelve-flowered distichostemon, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of twelve small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a spiral pattern along a central stem. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is known for its showy, delicate blooms. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
