    "intro": "Disa draconis, commonly known as the dragon orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its vivid red and orange flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns resembling scales or dragon-like features. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions, and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it produces small, greenish-blue seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. Disa draconis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
