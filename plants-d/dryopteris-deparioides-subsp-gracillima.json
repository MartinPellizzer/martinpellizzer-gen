    "intro": "Dryopteris deparioides subsp. gracillima, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and gracefully drooping. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The subspecies gracillima is distinguished by its slender, more delicate fronds compared to other members of the species."
