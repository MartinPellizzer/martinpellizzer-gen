    "intro": "Drosera rotundifolia var. breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed sundew, is a variant of the common sundew, characterized by its shorter stems and reduced leaf rosette. It is a carnivorous plant native to the northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere, typically found in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. The plant produces sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that trap and digest insects, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. Its small, white flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant is often used in horticultural collections due to its unique appearance and ecological interest. This variant is closely related to other Drosera species and exhibits similar adaptations to its harsh, wetland habitat."
