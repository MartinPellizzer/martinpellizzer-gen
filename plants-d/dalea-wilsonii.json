It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. It has small, bean-like pods that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Dalea wilsonii is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
