It features rosettes of fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically green with a bluish or purplish hue. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid climates."
