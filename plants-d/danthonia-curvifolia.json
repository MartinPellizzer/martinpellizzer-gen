    "intro": "Danthonia curvifolia, commonly known as the curlyleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, dark green leaves that curve downward, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Danthonia curvifolia is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
