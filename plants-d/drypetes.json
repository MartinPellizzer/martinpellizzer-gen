    "intro": "Drypetes, commonly known as the flame tree or fire tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are characterized by their showy, bright red or orange flowers that appear in clusters, often resembling flames. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Drypetes species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and can also have traditional medicinal uses in some cultures."
