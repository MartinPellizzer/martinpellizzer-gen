    "intro": "Dacryodes dahomensis, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to western Africa. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, resinous bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
