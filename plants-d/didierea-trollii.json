    "intro": "Didierea trollii, commonly known as the skeleton bush, is a unique succulent plant native to the arid regions of Madagascar. It is characterized by its woody, branching structure and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature that helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. Didierea trollii is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
