    "intro": "Diplodium reflexum, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. Diplodium reflexum thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions, making it a resilient and visually striking plant."
