    "intro": "Doronicum cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved leopard's bane, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
