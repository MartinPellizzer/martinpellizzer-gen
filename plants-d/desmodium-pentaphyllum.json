    "intro": "Desmodium pentaphyllum, commonly known as hairy bird's-paw, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, each leaflet bearing a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, bean-like seeds. Desmodium pentaphyllum is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop due to its nutritional value and hardiness."
