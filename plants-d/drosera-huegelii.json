    "intro": "Drosera huegelii, commonly known as the Hugel's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its small, white flowers bloom in late summer, adding a delicate appearance to its otherwise insect-trapping form. Drosera huegelii is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in humid conditions with bright, indirect light."
