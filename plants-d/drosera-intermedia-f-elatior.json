    "intro": "Drosera intermedia f. elatior, commonly known as the tall common sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth and sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that trap insects. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swampy areas. Its unique adaptations for nutrient absorption make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
