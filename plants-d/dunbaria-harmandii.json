    "intro": "Dunbaria harmandii, commonly known as the Harmand's dunbaria, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, preferring well-drained environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink, depending on the species variant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dunbaria harmandii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
