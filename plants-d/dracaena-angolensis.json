    "intro": "Dracaena angolensis, commonly known as the Angola dracaena, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and long, narrow leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tinge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear at the base of the leaves. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Dracaena angolensis is also valued for its air-purifying properties, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
