    "intro": "Dischidia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered bubble vine, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant is characterized by its unique, swollen nodes along the stems, which give it its common name. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Dischidia longiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to form dense, cascading vines."
