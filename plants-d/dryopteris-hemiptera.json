    "intro": "Dryopteris hemiptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of foliage. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
