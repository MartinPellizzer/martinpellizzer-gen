    "intro": "Dolicholus erectus, commonly known as the upright dolicholus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a subtle fragrance. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and woody stems that become more pronounced with age. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
