    "intro": "Dryopteris austriaca subsp. euspinulosa, commonly known as the Austrian wood fern, is a fern species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in spore-bearing clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its distinctive appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
