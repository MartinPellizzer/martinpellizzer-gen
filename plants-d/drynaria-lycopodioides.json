    "intro": "Drynaria lycopodioides, commonly known as the fern moss or rock fern, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a perennial, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive morphology, featuring a short, creeping rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that are often scale-like in appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Drynaria lycopodioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
