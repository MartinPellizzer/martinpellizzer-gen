    "intro": "Dendrobium barioense, commonly known as the Bario orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Bario region of Malaysia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often blooming in clusters. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients to help it survive in its natural habitat. Dendrobium barioense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
