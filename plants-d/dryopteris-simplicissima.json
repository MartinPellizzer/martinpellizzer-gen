    "intro": "Dryopteris simplicissima, commonly known as the barren sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically unbranched and have a finely divided, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
