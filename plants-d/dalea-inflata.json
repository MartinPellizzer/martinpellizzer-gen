    "intro": "Dalea inflata, commonly known as the inflated milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive inflated seed pods. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and shrublands. Its leaves are trifoliate, and the flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters. Dalea inflata plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various insects and supporting soil stability through its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
