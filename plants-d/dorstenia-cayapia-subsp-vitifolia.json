    "intro": "Dorstenia cayapia subsp. vitifolia, commonly known as the Cayap\u00e1 dwarf milkweed, is a succulent plant native to the humid lowland forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its short, branching stems and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne on short pedicels. It is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments and has a slow growth rate. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
