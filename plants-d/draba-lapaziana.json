    "intro": "Draba lapaziana, commonly known as the Lapaz dwarf cabbage, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Draba lapaziana is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
