    "intro": "Dombeya obovata, commonly known as the broadleaf dombeya, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. These flowers are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dombeya obovata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and adaptability to well-drained soils."
