    "intro": "Desmotrichum stenoglossum, commonly known as the narrow-lipped desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with trumpet-shaped petals that range in color from white to pink. Its adaptations to dry environments include deep root systems and the ability to store water in its leaves. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
