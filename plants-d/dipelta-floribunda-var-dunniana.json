    "intro": "Dipelta floribunda var. dunniana, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
