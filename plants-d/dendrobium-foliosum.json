    "intro": "Dendrobium foliosum, commonly known as the leafy dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a stem that produces numerous leaves and flower spikes. The plant typically has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are usually yellow or green with a white or pink lip, and they bloom in summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
