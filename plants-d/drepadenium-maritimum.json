    "intro": "Drepadenium maritimum, commonly known as the sea lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga. It thrives in coastal environments, particularly on moist rock surfaces and shaded areas near the shoreline. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the algal and fungal components. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small marine organisms. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered an indicator species for maritime ecosystems."
