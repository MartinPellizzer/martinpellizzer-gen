    "intro": "Danthonia hirsuta, commonly known as hairy danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and heathlands. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Danthonia hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
