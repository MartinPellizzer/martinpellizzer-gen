    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tussocks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, fluffy seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
