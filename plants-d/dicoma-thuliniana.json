    "intro": "Dicoma thuliniana, commonly known as the Cape mountain snowbush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-gray, providing a striking contrast to the delicate flowers. Dicoma thuliniana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
