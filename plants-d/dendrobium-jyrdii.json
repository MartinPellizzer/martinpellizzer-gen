    "intro": "Dendrobium jyrdii, commonly known as the Jyrd's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing numerous fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for storing water. Dendrobium jyrdii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
