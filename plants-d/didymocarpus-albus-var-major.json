It is a small evergreen tree characterized by its smooth, pale bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing pale, fleshy seeds. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
