    "intro": "Dorstenia urceolata, commonly known as the \"water bucket plant,\" is a striking member of the Malvaceae family native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, urn-shaped, water-storing leaves that can hold up to 150 milliliters of water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss and store moisture efficiently. Dorstenia urceolata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and drought tolerance."
