    "intro": "Distichlis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. Distichlis species are typically found in coastal areas and saline soils, where they play a crucial role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. The plants produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to their adaptability to harsh environments, Distichlis species are often used in ecological restoration projects."
