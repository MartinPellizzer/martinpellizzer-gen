It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stem, palmate leaves, and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
