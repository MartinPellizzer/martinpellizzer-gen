    "intro": "Dendrobium moniliforme, commonly known as the bead orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like stems that bear clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces numerous tiny, bead-like pseudobulbs along its stem, which store water and nutrients. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Dendrobium moniliforme is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
