    "intro": "Dryopteris indusiata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that are adorned with brown, cinnamon-colored indusia on the lower part of the fertile leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help stabilize the soil. The cinnamon fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
