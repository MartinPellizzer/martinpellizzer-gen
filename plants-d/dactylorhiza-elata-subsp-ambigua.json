    "intro": "Dactylorhiza elata subsp. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features a single, erect stem with several oval-shaped leaves and produces pendulous, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
