It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Dendrophthora ternata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
