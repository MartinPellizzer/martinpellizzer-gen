    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis subsp. cluthensis, commonly known as the Clutha wood fern, is a fern species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, curved pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The subsp. cluthensis is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to the main species."
