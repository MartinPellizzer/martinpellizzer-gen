It features a distinctive rosette of lanceolate, leathery leaves that form a dense, compact cluster. The plant has a short, thick rhizome that supports its growth and produces sporangia on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its unique leaf structure and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
