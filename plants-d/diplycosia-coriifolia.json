    "intro": "Diplycosia coriifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in dry soils. Diplycosia coriifolia is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, contributing to the ecological stability of its environment."
