    "intro": "Dryopteris dilatata var. deltoidea, commonly known as the delta maidenhair fern, is a variant of the lady fern characterized by its distinctive, deltoid-shaped fronds. This fern is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided, silky-textured leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and woodland settings."
