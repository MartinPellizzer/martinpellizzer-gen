    "intro": "Doryopteris feei f. major, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a variant of the Doryopteris feei species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. This fern is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length, making it one of the largest ferns in its genus. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night due to the presence of specialized chloroplasts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high levels of organic matter in the soil. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
