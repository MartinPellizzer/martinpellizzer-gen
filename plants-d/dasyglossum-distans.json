    "intro": "Dasyglossum distans, commonly known as the distant-tongued plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic, often hollow stems and compound leaves. It typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is known for its small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in umbrella-like clusters. The plant's unique feature is its elongated, tongue-like petals, which give it its scientific name. It is often found in meadows and along streambanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Dasyglossum distans is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its distinctive morphology and ecological niche."
