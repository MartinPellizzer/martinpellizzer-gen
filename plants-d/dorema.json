    "intro": "Dorema, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants typically have hairy, glandular leaves and produce showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white. Dorema species are adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss. They are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
