    "intro": "Dryopteris tridens, commonly known as the serrated wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are deeply divided into narrow, serrated segments, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically arranged in a distinct pattern."
