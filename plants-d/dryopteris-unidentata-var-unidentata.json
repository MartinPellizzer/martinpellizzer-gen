    "intro": "Dryopteris unidentata var. unidentata, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long, with a graceful, arching appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus."
