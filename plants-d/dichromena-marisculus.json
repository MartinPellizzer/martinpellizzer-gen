    "intro": "Dichromena marisculus, commonly known as the sea dichromena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds typical of maritime environments. Dichromena marisculus plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
