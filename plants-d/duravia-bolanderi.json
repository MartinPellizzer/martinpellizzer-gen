    "intro": "Duravia bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's duravia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as chaparral and coastal scrub. It produces small, pale yellow to green flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Duravia bolanderi is considered a rare and endangered species."
