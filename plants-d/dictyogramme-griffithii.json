    "intro": "Dictyogramme griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, linear segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Dictyogramme griffithii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
