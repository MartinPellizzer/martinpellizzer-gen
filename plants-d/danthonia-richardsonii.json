    "intro": "Danthonia richardsonii, commonly known as the Richardson's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in dry, rocky environments. Danthonia richardsonii is often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
