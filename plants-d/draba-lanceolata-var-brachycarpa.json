    "intro": "Draba lanceolata var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-seed whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in a single terminal cluster. Its fruit is a short, rounded silique, distinguishing it from other Draba species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
