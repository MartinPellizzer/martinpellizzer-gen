    "intro": "Drosera cucullata, commonly known as the Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested to provide nutrients. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of red or yellow droplets that help in capturing prey. Drosera cucullata is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological role in controlling insect populations."
