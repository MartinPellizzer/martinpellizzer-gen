    "intro": "Desmophlebium lechleri, commonly known as the rubber tree or caucho tree, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, bark-like trunk that can reach significant heights. The plant is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its latex-producing properties. Its leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and plays a role in both ecological and economic systems in its native region."
