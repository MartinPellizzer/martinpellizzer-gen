    "intro": "Dryopteris juergensii, commonly known as the Juergens' wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features a distinctive, upright frond structure with a dark green, leathery texture and a deeply divided, pinnate shape. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
