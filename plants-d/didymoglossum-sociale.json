    "intro": "Didymoglossum sociale, commonly known as the common field moss, is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in moist, temperate environments. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant has leafy shoots that are typically less than 2 cm in length, with a narrow, elongated shape. Its leaves are usually appressed to the stem and have a distinct midrib. Didymoglossum sociale plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
