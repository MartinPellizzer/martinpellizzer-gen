It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often covered in fine hairs. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
