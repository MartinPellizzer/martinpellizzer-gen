    "intro": "Diatremis, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers and are typically found growing in rocky or crevice habitats. Diatremis species are often epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or on rocks, respectively. They have specialized root systems that allow them to absorb moisture and nutrients from their environment. The genus is native to various regions in the Mediterranean and parts of Asia, where it thrives in specific microclimates."
