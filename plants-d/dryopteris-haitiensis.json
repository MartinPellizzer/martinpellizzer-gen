    "intro": "Dryopteris haitiensis, commonly known as Haitian wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Haiti. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it can access the necessary moisture and nutrients. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
