    "intro": "Dryopteris lacunosa, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Dryopteris lacunosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate partial shade."
