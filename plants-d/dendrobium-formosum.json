    "intro": "Dendrobium formosum, commonly known as the Formosan orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Dendrobium formosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to various growing conditions."
