    "intro": "Dalrympelea nitida, commonly known as the silver-leafed rock heath, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of eastern Australia. It is a shrub with slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded understorey environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
