    "intro": "Dictyostega purdieana, commonly known as the mountain thimbleweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a slender, branching stem that supports its small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
