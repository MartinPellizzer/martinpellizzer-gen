    "intro": "Dorstenia volkensii, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a flowering plant native to East Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that resemble the petals of a buttercup. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often appearing after the leaves have fully developed. Dorstenia volkensii is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
