    "intro": "Dendrobium shearmanii, commonly known as the Shearman's orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Australia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Dendrobium shearmanii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated for horticultural purposes."
