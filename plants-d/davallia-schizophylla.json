    "intro": "Davallia schizophylla, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sorus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
