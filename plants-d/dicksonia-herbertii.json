    "intro": "Dicksonia herbertii, commonly known as the Herbert's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of spirally arranged fronds that give it a unique, elegant appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. The trunk is covered in a layer of persistent, fibrous roots that help anchor the plant and absorb moisture from the soil."
