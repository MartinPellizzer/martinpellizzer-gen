    "intro": "Delphinium alopecuroides, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Delphinium alopecuroides is adapted to cold, alpine environments and prefers well-drained, rocky soils."
