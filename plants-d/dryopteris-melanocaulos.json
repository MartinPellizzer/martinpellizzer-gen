    "intro": "Dryopteris melanocaulos, commonly known as the black-stemmed wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the forests of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is characterized by its dark, wiry stems and large, bipinnate fronds. The fronds are usually a deep green with a leathery texture and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. It produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, which are typically found near the tips of the pinnae. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden settings."
