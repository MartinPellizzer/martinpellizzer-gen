    "intro": "Dianthus brachyanthus var. nivalis, commonly known as the snow-dusted carnation, is a striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding vibrant color to rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss in arid conditions. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
