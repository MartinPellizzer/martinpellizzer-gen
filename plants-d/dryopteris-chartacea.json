    "intro": "Dryopteris chartacea, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, almost decorative appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant. Dryopteris chartacea thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
