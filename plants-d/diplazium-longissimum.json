    "intro": "Diplazium longissimum, commonly known as the long-stemmed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has long, slender fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a delicate, lacy appearance. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates in its habitat. Diplazium longissimum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
