    "intro": "Danthonia californica, commonly known as California needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its drought tolerance and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife."
