    "intro": "Dracunculus vulgaris var. laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth giant hogweed, is a striking plant characterized by its large, umbrella-like compound leaves and towering flower stalks. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant features showy, white to pinkish flowers arranged in an umbel, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically smooth and have a distinctive, waxy texture, while its stems are hollow and covered in fine hairs. Due to its rapid growth and potential to become invasive, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
