    "intro": "Desmodium nutans, commonly known as the nodding sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rapid leaf movements in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonastic movement. The plant has trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, white or purple flowers. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable in soil enrichment. Desmodium nutans is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop due to its nutritional value."
