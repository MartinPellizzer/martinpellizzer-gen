It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow to reddish-pink flowers. The plant is known for its unique seed pods, which are hairy and often contain spines, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along riverbanks. Desmodium caripense is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing abilities, making it useful in agricultural settings."
