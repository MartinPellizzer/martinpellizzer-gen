    "intro": "Digitaria elytroblephara, commonly known as the panicle grass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, compact panicle inflorescence, which consists of multiple spikelets arranged in a branching pattern. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as fields, roadsides, and disturbed areas, often forming a dense ground cover. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Digitaria elytroblephara is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
