    "intro": "Drosera indica var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that trap insects, which are then digested by the plant's enzymes. The variety albiflora is distinguished by its pale or white flowers, which contrast with the typical red or pink hues of other Drosera species. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wetlands. This plant is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
