    "intro": "Dendropanax amamiensis, commonly known as the Amami sycamore, is a rare evergreen tree native to the Amami Islands of Japan. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its restricted habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
