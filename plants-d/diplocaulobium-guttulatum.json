It features floating leaves that are oval to heart-shaped with a waxy surface and distinct spots, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, typically with five petals and numerous stamens. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the water. The species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
