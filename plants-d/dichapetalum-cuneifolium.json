    "intro": "Dichapetalum cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dichapetalum, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often found in moist, wooded areas, contributing to the understory vegetation in its native habitat. The species is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
