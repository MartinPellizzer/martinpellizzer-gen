    "intro": "Dendrobium montis-movi, commonly known as the mountain-moving orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant possesses a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, adapting to its arid mountainous environment. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, helping to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
