    "intro": "Diplothemium jangadense, commonly known as the Jangadense fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often submerged or floating. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread across water surfaces. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native environment."
