    "intro": "Diuris amabilis, commonly known as the pink fairy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a single, erect stem with several linear leaves and produces striking pink or purple flowers with a distinctive spurred shape. Its flowers are often short-lived, opening in late winter to early spring. Diuris amabilis is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
