    "intro": "Dichapetalum potamophilum, commonly known as the river waterleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its alternate, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The plant is often found near water sources, such as rivers and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils."
