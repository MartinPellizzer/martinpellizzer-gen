    "intro": "Dianthus carthusianorum f. atrisquamatus, commonly known as the Black Squamate Carnation, is a rare and striking variant of the carnation family. It is characterized by its dark purple to almost black petals, which contrast sharply with its white or pale pink centers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
