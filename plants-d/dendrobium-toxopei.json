    "intro": "Dendrobium toxopei, commonly known as the Toxopei orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive, narrow, and elongated shape. Dendrobium toxopei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
