    "intro": "Dicranopteris hawaiicola, commonly known as the Hawaiian water fern, is a rare fern species native to the island of Hawaii. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a unique morphology, with small, finely divided leaves that help it thrive in aquatic conditions. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
