    "intro": "Doria nodulosa, commonly known as the nodular doria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its roots are tuberous and store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Doria nodulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry environments."
