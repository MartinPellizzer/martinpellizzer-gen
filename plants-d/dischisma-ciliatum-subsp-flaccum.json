    "intro": "Dischisma ciliatum subsp. flaccum, commonly known as the silky dischisma, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ornamental value in native gardens."
