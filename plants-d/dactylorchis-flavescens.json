    "intro": "Dactylorchis flavescens, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb with a slender, grass-like stem and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The species is characterized by its mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake."
