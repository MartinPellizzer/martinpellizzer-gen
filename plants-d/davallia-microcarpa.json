    "intro": "Davallia microcarpa, commonly known as the mouse-ear fern, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 inches long, with a distinctive, rounded shape. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
