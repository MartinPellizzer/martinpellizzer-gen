    "intro": "Delphinium umbrosum, commonly known as the shade delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a strong, somewhat bitter scent. Delphinium umbrosum thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats."
