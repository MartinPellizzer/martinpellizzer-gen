    "intro": "Douglasia montana var. biflora, commonly known as the mountain Douglasia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The species features two distinct flower types on the same plant, a trait known as heterostyly, which is common in some solanaceous plants. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral morphology and ecological adaptations."
