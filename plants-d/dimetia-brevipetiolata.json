    "intro": "Dimetia brevipetiolata, commonly known as the short-petioled cycad, is a unique species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like arrangement of feather-like leaves, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
