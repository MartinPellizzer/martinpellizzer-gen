    "intro": "Dryadella wuerstlei, commonly known as the W\u00fcrstl's dryad, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes trees and shrubs known for their aromatic wood and medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its propagation. Due to habitat loss and limited study, Dryadella wuerstlei remains a subject of botanical interest and conservation concern."
