    "intro": "Dracaena javanica var. maculata, commonly known as the Variegated Dracaena, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow, dark green leaves with distinctive white or yellow variegation patterns. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires moderate watering. It is often used as a decorative indoor plant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying qualities. The variegation is a result of genetic mutations that affect chlorophyll production in certain leaf areas."
