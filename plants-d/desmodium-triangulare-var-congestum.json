    "intro": "Desmodium triangulare var. congestum, commonly known as the clustered velvetbean, is a tropical legume native to regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a useful plant in soil enrichment and agroforestry systems."
