    "intro": "Dodecadenia grandiflora var. griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's dodecadenia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, typically displaying vibrant red or orange hues. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae and is known for its complex inflorescence structure, which consists of multiple flower clusters arranged in a spiral pattern. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
