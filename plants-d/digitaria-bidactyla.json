    "intro": "Digitaria bidactyla, commonly known as two-awn grass, is a species of grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in warm, dry environments such as grasslands and savannas. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two awns on each lemma. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Digitaria bidactyla is often used for forage and has some ornamental value in landscaping."
