It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that exhibit a distinct veining pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures include sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. The botanical features of Decaschistia nervifolia make it an important component of tropical rainforest ecosystems."
