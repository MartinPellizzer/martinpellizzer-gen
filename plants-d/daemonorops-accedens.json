    "intro": "Daemonorops accedens, commonly known as the golden tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor firmly in the soil while supporting its towering structure. The golden tree fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
