    "intro": "Davallia pulchra var. pseudocystopteris, commonly known as the golden fern, is a variant of the native fern species characterized by its distinctive, glossy, golden-green fronds. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is native to the eastern United States, particularly the Appalachian region. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with clusters of dark brown, club-shaped sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
