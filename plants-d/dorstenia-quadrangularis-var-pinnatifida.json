    "intro": "Dorstenia quadrangularis var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the needle-leaf false arum, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its unique, elongated, and often spiny leaves. The leaves are typically arranged in a pinnate pattern, giving the plant its specific variety name, and they are usually dark green with a glossy texture. It produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is often brightly colored. This plant is native to regions of Central and South America and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
