    "intro": "Dendrobium borneense, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, jointed pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often blooming during the dry season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded forest floor. Dendrobium borneense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
