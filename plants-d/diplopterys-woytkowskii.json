It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves. The plant is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, which have historically been used by indigenous peoples to poison the tips of arrows. Its growth habit includes woody stems and small, clustered flowers that produce white or pale yellow blooms. The plant's botanical significance lies in its chemical composition and traditional use in ethnobotanical practices."
