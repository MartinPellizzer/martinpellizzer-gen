    "intro": "Dianella lignosa, commonly known as the hardy flax lily, is a perennial plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that forms a compact, bushy clump. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. Dianella lignosa is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance once established."
