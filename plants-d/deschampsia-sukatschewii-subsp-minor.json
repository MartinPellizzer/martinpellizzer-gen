    "intro": "Deschampsia sukatschewii subsp. minor, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to central and eastern Europe. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with slender, wiry stems and fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of diverse grassland ecosystems."
