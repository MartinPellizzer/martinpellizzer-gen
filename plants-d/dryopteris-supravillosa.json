    "intro": "Dryopteris supravillosa, commonly known as the silky fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Dryopteris supravillosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
