    "intro": "Davallia belangeri, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden-hairy layer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
