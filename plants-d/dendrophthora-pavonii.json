    "intro": "Dendrophthora pavonii, commonly known as the pink-stemmed bracket fungus, is a species of polypore mushroom native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive pink to reddish-brown cap and a tough, woody stem. This fungus typically grows on dead or decaying hardwood trees, playing a role in the decomposition process. Its fruiting bodies are often found in humid environments, such as forests and woodlands. Dendrophthora pavonii is valued in mycology for its unique coloration and ecological function in forest ecosystems."
