    "intro": "Daucus brachylobus, commonly known as the short-stemmed carrot, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are similar in appearance to carrots but are not typically cultivated for food. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
