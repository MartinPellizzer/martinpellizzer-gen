It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive hairy texture on its trunk, which gives it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The fronds are used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants in horticulture."
