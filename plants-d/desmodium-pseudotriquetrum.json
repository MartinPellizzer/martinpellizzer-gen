    "intro": "Desmodium pseudotriquetrum, commonly known as false ticktrefoil, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with three oval to elliptical leaflets and small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in grasslands, disturbed areas, and along roadsides, and it plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
