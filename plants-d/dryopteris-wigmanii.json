    "intro": "Dryopteris wigmanii, commonly known as the Wigman's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments and are typically dark green with a leathery texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction."
