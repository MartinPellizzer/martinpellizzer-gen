    "intro": "Delphinium ochroleucum, commonly known as the white-livered larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of showy, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often overlooked despite their ornamental potential. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive white or pale green marking on the underside, contributing to its unique appearance. Delphinium ochroleucum is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
