It is characterized by its complex, bipinnate fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
