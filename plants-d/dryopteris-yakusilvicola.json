It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the forests of Yakushima Island. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of the region."
