    "intro": "Deyeuxia henryi, commonly known as Henry's flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments. Deyeuxia henryi is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
