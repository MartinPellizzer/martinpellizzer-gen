    "intro": "Dianthus decrescens, commonly known as the creeping pinks, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along its sprawling stems. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat, helping it thrive in rocky or sandy soils. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in coastal areas and dry meadows. Dianthus decrescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
