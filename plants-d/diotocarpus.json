    "intro": "Diotocarpus, commonly known as the broad-leafed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range from white to pink. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Diotocarpus is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
