    "intro": "Didissandra filicina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved didissandra, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Didissandraceae and is characterized by its slender, evergreen stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by the development of elliptical, woody fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it of interest to researchers studying plant adaptation and conservation in high-altitude ecosystems."
