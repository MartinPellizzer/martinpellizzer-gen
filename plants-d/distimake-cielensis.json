    "intro": "Distimake cielensis, commonly known as the celestial mist plant, is a rare flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that resemble woven silk, and its pale blue flowers that bloom only during the early morning hours. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial shade to prevent leaf scorching. Its unique structure allows it to capture and retain moisture from the mist, which is crucial for its survival. Botanists classify it as a member of the Bromeliaceae family, known for its ability to store water in its leaf rosettes."
