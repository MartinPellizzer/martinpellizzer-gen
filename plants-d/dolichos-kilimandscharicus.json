The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed soils and along forest edges. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate and slightly hairy. The species is valued not only for its nutritional content but also for its role in traditional agriculture and ecological systems."
