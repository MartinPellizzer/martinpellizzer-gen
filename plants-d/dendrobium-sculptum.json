    "intro": "Dendrobium sculptum, commonly known as the sculpted orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its striking, ridged pseudobulbs and showy, long-lasting flowers that can range in color from white to pink and yellow. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation. Dendrobium sculptum thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
