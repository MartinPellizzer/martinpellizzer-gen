    "intro": "Drymaria villosa subsp. paramorum, commonly known as the hairy drymaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine, soft pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and landscaping in suitable climates."
