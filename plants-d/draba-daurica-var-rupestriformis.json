    "intro": "Draba daurica var. rupestriformis, commonly known as Daurian rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, basal leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer. The plant is well adapted to harsh, rocky environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its compact growth habit and resilience make it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists and gardeners alike."
