    "intro": "Draba ussuriensis, commonly known as the Ussuri Draba, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a small annual or biennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, slender stem that bears a few small, yellowish-white flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including the Russian Far East, northeastern China, and Korea, it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant's flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, rounded pods that contain several seeds. Draba ussuriensis is known for its resilience to cold climates and is often found in disturbed or nutrient-poor soils."
