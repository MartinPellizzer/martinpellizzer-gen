    "intro": "Diplazium patens, commonly known as the wandering fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that spread horizontally along the ground. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with numerous pinnae, often covered in a fine layer of white tomentum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
