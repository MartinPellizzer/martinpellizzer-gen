    "intro": "Desmodium molliculum, commonly known as silky desmodium, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is known for its rapid growth habit. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, hairy pod, and it plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
