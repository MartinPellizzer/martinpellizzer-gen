    "intro": "Doellingeria ledophylla var. covillei, commonly known as the Coville's goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, golden-yellow foliage, which is composed of small, narrow leaves arranged in a compact, bushy form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by oval, winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid to semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyons. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand drought and poor soil conditions."
