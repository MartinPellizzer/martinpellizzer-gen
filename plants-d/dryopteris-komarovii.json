    "intro": "Dryopteris komarovii, commonly known as Komarov's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus."
