    "intro": "Detris simulans, commonly known as the false sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in sandy or rocky soils. Detris simulans is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
