    "intro": "Drymaria glandulosa var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular drymaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a suitable plant for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
