    "intro": "Dioon tomasellii var. sonorense, commonly known as the Sonoran dioon, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to the Sonoran Desert in North America. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a semi-arid climate with minimal rainfall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
