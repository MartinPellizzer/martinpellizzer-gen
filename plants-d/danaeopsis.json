    "intro": "Danaeopsis, commonly known as the \"flowering grass\" or \"false orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family. It is characterized by its delicate, orchid-like flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Danaeopsis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, fragrant blooms that attract various pollinators."
