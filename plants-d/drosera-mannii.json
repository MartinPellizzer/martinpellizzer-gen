    "intro": "Drosera mannii, commonly known as the Cape York Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swampy areas. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often appearing in late winter or early spring. Drosera mannii is a short-lived perennial, with a life cycle that includes a dormant phase during dry periods."
