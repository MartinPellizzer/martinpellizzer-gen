    "intro": "Daucus asper, commonly known as rough carrot, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features a taproot that is typically not edible, though it resembles that of the common carrot. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive rough texture, giving it its common name. The small, yellowish flowers appear in umbels and are followed by small, dry fruits."
