    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis subsp. baltica, commonly known as the Baltic marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and fens, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a tall, unbranched stem with a single, showy spike of pale pink to white flowers. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. This subspecies is characterized by its slender leaves and is often found in association with other orchid species in its wetland environment."
