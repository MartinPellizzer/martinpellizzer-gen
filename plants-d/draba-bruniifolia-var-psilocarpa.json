    "intro": "Draba bruniifolia var. psilocarpa, commonly known as the hallucinogenic whitlow grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its small, basal rosette of leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous minute seeds. This variety is notable for containing psychoactive compounds, particularly psilocybin, which makes it of interest in both botanical and ethnobotanical studies."
