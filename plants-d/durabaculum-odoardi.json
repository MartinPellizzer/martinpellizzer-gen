    "intro": "Durabaculum odoardi, commonly known as the Odoard's hardy orchid, is a rare and resilient plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and well-drained soil. The plant features a compact growth habit with dense, grass-like foliage and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from rocky substrates, making it well-suited for harsh alpine conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species requiring conservation efforts."
