    "intro": "Delphinium tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has soft, hairy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Delphinium tomentosum is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and is also noted for its toxic alkaloids, which make it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
