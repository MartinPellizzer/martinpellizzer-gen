    "intro": "Decarinium glandulosum, commonly known as the stickyleaf plant, is a species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which can trap small insects. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are small and yellow, often clustered in dense inflorescences. The sticky leaves make it an effective trap for pest control in natural settings."
