    "intro": "Dryopteris interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have a serrated, interrupted appearance along the margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered with a dense layer of brownish, hairy tissue. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
