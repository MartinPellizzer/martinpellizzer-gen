    "intro": "Dysoxylum purpureum, commonly known as the purple-leafed strangler fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Moraceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, purple-tinged leaves. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers followed by inedible, round, purple fruits. It is often found in lowland rainforests and can grow up to 30 meters tall. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense canopies, it plays a significant role in shaping the forest understory."
