    "intro": "Dendrobium crumenatum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a red or purple throat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. Dendrobium crumenatum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to cultivation."
