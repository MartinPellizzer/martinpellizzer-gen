    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudotetragona f. major, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf wood fern. It is characterized by its large, leathery, triangular-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, rounded pinnae that give the plant a dense, shield-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and acidic soil."
