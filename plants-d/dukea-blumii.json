    "intro": "Dukea blumii, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family, native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its compact size, typically reaching only a few feet in height, with a stout trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones instead of flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a rare and valuable species in both horticulture and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Dukea blumii is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
