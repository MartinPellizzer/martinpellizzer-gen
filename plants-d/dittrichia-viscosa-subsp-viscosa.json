    "intro": "Dittrichia viscosa subsp. viscosa, commonly known as sticky dwarf dandelion, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that are covered in fine, sticky glands. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its sticky leaves and rapid growth make it a hardy, resilient species adapted to arid conditions."
