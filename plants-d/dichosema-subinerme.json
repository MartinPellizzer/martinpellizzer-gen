    "intro": "Dichosema subinerme, commonly known as the white orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the Orchidaceae family. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant features showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its tropical habitat. The orchid is typically found growing as an epiphyte on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments."
