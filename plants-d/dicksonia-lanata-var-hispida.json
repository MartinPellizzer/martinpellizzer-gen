    "intro": "Dicksonia lanata var. hispida, commonly known as the hispid tree fern, is a variant of the silver tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a dense mass of dead, fibrous roots, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are bipinnate, with a feathery structure that contributes to its ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This plant is valued for its unique form and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
