    "intro": "Dryopteris lagerheimii, commonly known as the Hairy Wood Fern, is a species of fern native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that often have a hairy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
