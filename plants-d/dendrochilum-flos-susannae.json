    "intro": "Dendrochilum flos-susannae, commonly known as Susanna's tree orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces pendant, fleshy flowers that are highly fragrant, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
