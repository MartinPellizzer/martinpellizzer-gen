    "intro": "Digitaria ischaemum var. prostrata, commonly known as flatleaf brome, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats or cushions, often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The plant has narrow, flat leaves that are usually less than 1 cm wide, and its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, which allows it to spread horizontally along the ground. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
