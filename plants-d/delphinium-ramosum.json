    "intro": "Delphinium ramosum, commonly known as the blue delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Delphinium ramosum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitats."
