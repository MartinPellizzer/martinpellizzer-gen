    "intro": "Daphne albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and clusters of fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
