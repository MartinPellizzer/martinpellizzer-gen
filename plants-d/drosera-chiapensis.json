    "intro": "Drosera chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which it then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swamps. Its leaves are usually small and rosette-shaped, with a vibrant red coloration that aids in attracting prey. Drosera chiapensis is a relatively rare species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
