It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, rounded pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
