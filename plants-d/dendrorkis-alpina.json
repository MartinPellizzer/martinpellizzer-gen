    "intro": "Dendrorkis alpina, commonly known as the alpine dendrorkis, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
