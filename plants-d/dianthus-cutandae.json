It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers on short stalks. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Dianthus cutandae thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat."
