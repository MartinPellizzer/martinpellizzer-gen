    "intro": "Dendropanax borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean arrowleaf, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its simple, elongated leaves with a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within lowland and hill dipterocarp forests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
