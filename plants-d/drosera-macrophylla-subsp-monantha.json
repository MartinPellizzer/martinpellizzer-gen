    "intro": "Drosera macrophylla subsp. monantha, commonly known as the giant sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its large, sticky leaves that secrete a mucilage to trap insects. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with small, white flowers. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake by digesting captured prey."
