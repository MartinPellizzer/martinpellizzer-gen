    "intro": "Dennstaedtia smithii var. novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern genus native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It is a perennial herb characterized by its rhizomatous growth and pinnate, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
