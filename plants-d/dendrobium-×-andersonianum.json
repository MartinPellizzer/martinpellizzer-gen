    "intro": "Dendrobium \u00d7 andersonianum, commonly known as the orchid with the golden-yellow flowers and green stems, is a hybrid orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, where new shoots develop from the base of the plant. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Its flowers are typically arranged in racemes and bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red, making it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation. Dendrobium \u00d7 andersonianum prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to ensure optimal growth."
