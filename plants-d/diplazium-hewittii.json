    "intro": "Diplazium hewittii, commonly known as the Hewitt's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bi-pinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Diplazium hewittii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
