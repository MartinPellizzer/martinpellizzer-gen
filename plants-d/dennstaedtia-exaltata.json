    "intro": "Dennstaedtia exaltata, commonly known as the tall fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome producing both sterile and fertile fronds. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a smooth, glossy surface and a distinctive, elongated shape. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
