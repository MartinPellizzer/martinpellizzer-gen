    "intro": "Dryopteris welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust and help it establish in nutrient-poor soils. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance, making it a striking ornamental plant."
