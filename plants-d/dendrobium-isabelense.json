    "intro": "Dendrobium isabelense, commonly known as the Isabel's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive, intricate pattern on the petals. Dendrobium isabelense thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
