    "intro": "Dendrobium brevibulbum, commonly known as the short-stemmed dendrobium, is a sympodial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with short, horizontal pseudobulbs and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium brevibulbum is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
