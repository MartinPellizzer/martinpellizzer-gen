    "intro": "Donkelaaria dichotoma, commonly known as the forked liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive branching structure, with a central stem that splits into two main branches, giving it its common name. Its leaves are small, closely spaced, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Donkelaaria dichotoma plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
