    "intro": "Desmodium deltoideum, commonly known as delta sensitive beggar's ticks, is a leguminous plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow to purple flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, followed by small, bean-like pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Desmodium deltoideum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in soil enrichment."
