    "intro": "Dryopteris acuminata var. cristata, commonly known as the cristate wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern characterized by its distinctive, crinkled fronds. It is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a unique, undulating appearance due to the presence of a central ridge and lateral lobes. It produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the undersides of its fronds, which are protected by indusia. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, textured foliage."
