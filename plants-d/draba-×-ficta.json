    "intro": "Draba \u00d7 ficta, commonly known as the hybrid rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Draba nemorosa and Draba incana, characterized by its low-growing habit and dense rosette of basal leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in a single terminal cluster. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a wide range of morphological variation across its geographic distribution."
