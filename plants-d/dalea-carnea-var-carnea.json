The plant has palmately divided leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its root system is fibrous and adapted to dry, sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Dalea carnea var. carnea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
