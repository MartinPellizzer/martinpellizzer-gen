It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a single, tall, hollow stem that bears a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, yellow composite flower that develops into a crown of white, fluffy seeds, typical of the dandelion genus. Drimopogon is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. It is a perennial herb that is native to Europe and parts of Asia."
