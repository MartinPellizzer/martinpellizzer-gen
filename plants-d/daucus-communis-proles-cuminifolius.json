    "intro": "Daucus communis proles cuminifolius, commonly known as the cuminleaf cowparsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of cumin, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats. Its biennial growth cycle involves a rosette of leaves in the first year and flowering and seed production in the second year."
