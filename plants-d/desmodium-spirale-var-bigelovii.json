It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is valued for its forage quality and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
