    "intro": "Drymocallis cuneifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the late summer and early autumn. The plant is often found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its botanical features include a robust root system and a tall, branching stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insects."
