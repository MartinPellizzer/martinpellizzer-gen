    "intro": "Dendrobium brachyphyta, commonly known as the short-stemmed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant prefers bright, indirect light and thrives in humid environments with well-draining soil. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in conditions with irregular rainfall. Dendrobium brachyphyta is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its delicate floral display."
