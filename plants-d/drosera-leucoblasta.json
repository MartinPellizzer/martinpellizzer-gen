    "intro": "Drosera leucoblasta, commonly known as the white-flowered sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of glandular-hair covered leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, and it thrives in moist, acidic environments. Drosera leucoblasta is a perennial species that often grows in rocky or sandy soils. Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient needs by digesting captured prey."
