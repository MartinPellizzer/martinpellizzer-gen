    "intro": "Diasperus litoralis, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salty sea breezes and periodic drought conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. Diasperus litoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
