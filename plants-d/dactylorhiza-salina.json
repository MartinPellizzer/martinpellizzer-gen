    "intro": "Dactylorhiza salina, commonly known as the salt marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-brown flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it tolerates high salinity levels. Its root system is highly developed, enabling it to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor, salty soils. Dactylorhiza salina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal habitats and supporting local biodiversity."
