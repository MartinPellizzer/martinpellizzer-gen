    "intro": "Dactylorhiza osmanica var. anatolica, commonly known as the Anatolian marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Turkey. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowering stems. The plant produces a single, erect flowering stem bearing several pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. It thrives in wetland or marshy habitats, requiring consistently moist soil and partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
