It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part of the plant. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and is often cultivated for its starchy, nutrient-rich tubers. Its growth habit involves twining stems that ascend support structures, and it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The tubers are valued for their culinary uses and have been used in traditional medicine for various health benefits."
