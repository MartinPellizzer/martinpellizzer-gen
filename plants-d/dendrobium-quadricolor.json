    "intro": "Dendrobium quadricolor, commonly known as the four-color orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact growth habit with short, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are striking, with four distinct color zones on each petal, typically in shades of white, yellow, pink, and red. Dendrobium quadricolor is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
