    "intro": "Diacrium bilamellatum var. reichenbachianum, commonly known as the Reichenbach's diacrium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring two distinct lamellae or lobes on each leaf blade. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with a striking combination of white and purple hues. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
