    "intro": "Drosera \u00d7 linglica, commonly known as the hybrid sundew, is a carnivorous plant resulting from the cross between Drosera rotundifolia and Drosera intermedia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, aiding in its nutrient uptake. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of mucilage. Drosera \u00d7 linglica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique trapping mechanism."
