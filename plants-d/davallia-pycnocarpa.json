    "intro": "Davallia pycnocarpa, commonly known as the dense-fruit hakea, is a species of fern native to Australia. It is characterized by its compact, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and densely packed. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial shade to full sun. Davallia pycnocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
