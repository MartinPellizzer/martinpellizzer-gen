It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Daucus anthriscus is also known for its aromatic qualities and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
