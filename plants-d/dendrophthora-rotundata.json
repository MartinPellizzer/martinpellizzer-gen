    "intro": "Dendrophthora rotundata, commonly known as the roundleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are important for local wildlife. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host tree's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. Dendrophthora rotundata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where its host trees thrive."
