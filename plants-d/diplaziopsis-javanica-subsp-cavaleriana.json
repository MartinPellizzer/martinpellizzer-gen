    "intro": "Diplaziopsis javanica subsp. cavaleriana, commonly known as the Javanese sword fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome often covered in a thick, fibrous sheath. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a single, kidney-shaped indusium. This species is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
