    "intro": "Digitaria humifusa f. rubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed browntop, is a grass species characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green coloration and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is notable for its reddish-brown stems, which give it its distinguishing appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. This variant is a common weed in agricultural fields and is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions."
