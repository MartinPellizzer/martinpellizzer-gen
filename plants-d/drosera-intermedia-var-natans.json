    "intro": "Drosera intermedia var. natans, commonly known as the floating sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky digestive fluid to trap insects. The plant floats on the water surface, with its roots suspended in the water rather than anchored in soil. Its small, white flowers bloom on slender stems, and it is adapted to nutrient-poor aquatic environments. This variant is distinct from the terrestrial form of Drosera intermedia due to its unique floating growth habit."
