    "intro": "Diplactis tongolensis, commonly known as the Tongolensis sword fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the species. Diplactis tongolensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
