    "intro": "Dryopteris poecilophlebia, commonly known as the variable shield fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a distinctive shield-shaped base. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with serrated margins that contribute to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. This fern is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
