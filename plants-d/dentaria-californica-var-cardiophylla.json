    "intro": "Dentaria californica var. cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaf toothplant, is a perennial herb native to California. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its unique leaf morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
