    "intro": "Diplotaxis pendula, commonly known as the hanging desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that are easily dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
