    "intro": "Dendropemon hincheanus, commonly known as the Hinchean orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers that often display vibrant colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features include fleshy roots and a specialized structure called a pseudobulb, which stores water and nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
