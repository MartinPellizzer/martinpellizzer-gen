    "intro": "Desmodium coeruleoviolaceum, commonly known as blue-violet desmodium, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with deep violet to blue hues, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, pea-like pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions for garden use."
