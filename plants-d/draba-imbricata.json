    "intro": "Draba imbricata, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. This species typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at high elevations where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Draba imbricata is characterized by its small, basal rosette of leaves and its clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers. It plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing food for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization."
