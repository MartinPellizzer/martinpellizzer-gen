    "intro": "Diplazium brachysorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hemionitidaceae. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia. Its rhizomes are often covered with a dense mat of roots, which helps it anchor in rocky or shaded environments. Diplazium brachysorum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
