    "intro": "Discretitheca nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal discretitheca, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and northern India. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
