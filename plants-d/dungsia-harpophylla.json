    "intro": "Dungsia harpophylla, commonly known as the hardy wallflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, brightly colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral display. Dungsia harpophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environmental conditions."
