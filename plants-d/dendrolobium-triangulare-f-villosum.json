It is a perennial shrub native to Australia, typically found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive triangular shape and small, yellow flowers clustered in dense spikes. It is adapted to dry conditions and has a deep root system for water absorption. The hairy texture of its leaves helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight."
