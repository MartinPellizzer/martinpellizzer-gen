    "intro": "Dieffenbachia picta var. antioquensis, commonly known as the Antioquian Dieffenbachia, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to Colombia. It features large, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive white, wavy pattern that contrasts sharply with its deep green background. The plant is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix and a spathe. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care and kept away from pets and children."
