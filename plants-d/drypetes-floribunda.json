    "intro": "Drypetes floribunda, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
