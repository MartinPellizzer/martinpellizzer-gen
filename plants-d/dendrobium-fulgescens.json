    "intro": "Dendrobium fulgescens, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its stems are pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its tropical environment. Dendrobium fulgescens is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
