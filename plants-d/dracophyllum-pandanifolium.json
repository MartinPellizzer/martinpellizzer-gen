    "intro": "Dracophyllum pandanifolium, commonly known as the pandan-leaved dracophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that resembles the leaves of the pandanus tree. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with compact, leathery leaves arranged in a whorled pattern. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of pink or white, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed. Dracophyllum pandanifolium thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, acidic soils."
