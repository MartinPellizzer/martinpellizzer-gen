    "intro": "Dryopteris divergens, commonly known as the brittle shield fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that often have a grayish-white underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are covered in a thick, leathery sheath, which helps protect it from environmental stress. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
