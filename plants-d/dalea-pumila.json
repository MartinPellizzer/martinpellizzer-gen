    "intro": "Dalea pumila, commonly known as the plains milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the central and western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in prairie and steppe habitats. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple. It is adapted to arid conditions and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species in xerophytic environments. Dalea pumila plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
