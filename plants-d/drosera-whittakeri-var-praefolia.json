It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, aiding in nutrient uptake. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of digestive secretions."
