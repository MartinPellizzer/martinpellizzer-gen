    "intro": "Dianthus sallentii, commonly known as the Sallent pink, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a perennial species characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant produces clusters of pink to red, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Dianthus sallentii is well-suited for rock gardens and dry, sunny conditions due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
