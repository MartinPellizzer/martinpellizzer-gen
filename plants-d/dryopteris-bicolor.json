    "intro": "Dryopteris bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that display a striking color contrast between the upper and lower surfaces. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor it in the soil. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
