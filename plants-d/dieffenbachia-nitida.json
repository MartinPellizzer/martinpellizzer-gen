    "intro": "Dieffenbachia nitida, commonly known as the Shiny Canna, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant produces striking, spathiflorous inflorescences with bright yellow flowers, though it is more appreciated for its foliage than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dieffenbachia nitida is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
