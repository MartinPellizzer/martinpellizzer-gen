    "intro": "Dorstenia cuspidata var. humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's zigzag plant, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, spirally twisted stems that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, often with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in moderate light conditions and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
