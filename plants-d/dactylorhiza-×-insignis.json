    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 insignis, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. The plant is a terrestrial orchid, typically growing in moist, shaded woodland habitats. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Dactylorhiza \u00d7 insignis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
