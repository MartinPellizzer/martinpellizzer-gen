    "intro": "Dryopteris presliana, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
