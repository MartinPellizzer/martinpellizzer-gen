    "intro": "Dalbergia louisii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
