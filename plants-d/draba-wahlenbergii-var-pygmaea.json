    "intro": "Draba wahlenbergii var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often found in mountainous areas with harsh climatic conditions. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures. Due to its delicate nature, it is often considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystems."
