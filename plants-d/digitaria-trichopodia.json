    "intro": "Digitaria trichopodia, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and ornamental settings."
