    "intro": "Digitaria denudata, commonly known as the nakedgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and wetlands. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Digitaria denudata is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its rapid growth rate, making it both a weed and a forage plant."
