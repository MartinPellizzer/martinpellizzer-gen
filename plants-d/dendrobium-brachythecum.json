    "intro": "Dendrobium brachythecum, commonly known as the short-leaf orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often in clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining, loose potting media. Dendrobium brachythecum is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
