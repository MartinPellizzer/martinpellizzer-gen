    "intro": "Dalbergia microphylla, commonly known as rosewood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. The tree is valued for its dense, dark-colored timber, which is highly sought after in the furniture and musical instrument industries. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forest areas. Due to overharvesting, it is also classified as a vulnerable species in some regions."
