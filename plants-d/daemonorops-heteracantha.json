    "intro": "Daemonorops heteracantha, commonly known as the hairy cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish, hairy scales. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being larger and more elongated than the male ones. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and conservation efforts."
