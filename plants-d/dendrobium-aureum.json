    "intro": "Dendrobium aureum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a subtle fragrance, which bloom during the summer months. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. Dendrobium aureum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various growing conditions."
