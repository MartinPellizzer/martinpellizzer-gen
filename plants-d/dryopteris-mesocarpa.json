    "intro": "Dryopteris mesocarpa, commonly known as the medium-spleen fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright, clump-forming growth habit and its distinctive, deeply divided fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a prominent midrib and serrated leaflets. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant's spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the fern life cycle."
