    "intro": "Dendrobium cobra, commonly known as the Cobra orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with erect, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with intricate patterns resembling a cobra's hood. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in its natural habitat. Dendrobium cobra thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
