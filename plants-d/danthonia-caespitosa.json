    "intro": "Danthonia caespitosa, commonly known as tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It forms dense, clump-like growths with slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in moist to wet soils, such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is used in ecological restoration and landscaping."
