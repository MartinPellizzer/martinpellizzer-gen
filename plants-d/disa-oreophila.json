    "intro": "Disa oreophila, commonly known as the cloud mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in crevices, while its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Disa oreophila is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
