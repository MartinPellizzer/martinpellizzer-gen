    "intro": "Dendrobium pantherinum, commonly known as the panther orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive dark red or purple lip. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Dendrobium pantherinum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
