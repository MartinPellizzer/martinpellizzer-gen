    "intro": "Draba minutissima, commonly known as the dwarf whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant grows close to the ground, with basal leaves that are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it is adapted to cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Due to its small size and delicate appearance, it is often overlooked but plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
