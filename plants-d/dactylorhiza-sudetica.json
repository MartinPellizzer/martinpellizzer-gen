    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sudetica, commonly known as the Sudetic marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and Eastern Europe. It thrives in wet meadows, bogs, and marshy areas, often found in nutrient-poor soils. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with three sepals and three petals, forming a distinctive orchid shape. Dactylorhiza sudetica is a member of the Orchidaceae family and plays an important role in its native ecosystems."
