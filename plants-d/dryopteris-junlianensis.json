    "intro": "Dryopteris junlianensis, commonly known as the Junlian fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, dark green foliage."
