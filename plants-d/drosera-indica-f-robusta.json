    "intro": "Drosera indica f. robusta, commonly known as the Indian Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested to provide nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments and has a rosette structure with broad, spoon-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of pink or red. This variant is notable for its robust growth compared to other forms of Drosera indica."
