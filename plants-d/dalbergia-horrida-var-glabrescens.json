    "intro": "Dalbergia horrida var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-surfaced ironwood, is a species of legume native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, with compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. This variety is noted for its smooth bark and relatively slow growth rate, making it a valuable but rare resource in its native habitat."
