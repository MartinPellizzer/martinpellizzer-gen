    "intro": "Dalea versicolor var. wislizeni, commonly known as the Wislizeni milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in drought conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria."
