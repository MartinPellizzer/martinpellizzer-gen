    "intro": "Dryopteris sogerensis, commonly known as the Soger's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
