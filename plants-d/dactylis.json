    "intro": "Dactylis, commonly known as goat's rue, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The flowers are typically clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, often with a distinctive blue or purple hue. Dactylis species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. They are sometimes used in forage agriculture due to their hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
