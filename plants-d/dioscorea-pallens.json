    "intro": "Dioscorea pallens, commonly known as the white yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into capsule fruits. Its tubers are often used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and hypoglycemic properties. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both agricultural and ethnobotanical contexts."
