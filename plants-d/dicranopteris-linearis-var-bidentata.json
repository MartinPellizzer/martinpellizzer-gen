    "intro": "Dicranopteris linearis var. bidentata, commonly known as the bidentate water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its distinctive two-toothed margins on the fronds. It is a perennial aquatic fern that thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The fronds are typically linear and elongated, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Its botanical features make it an important species in wetland ecosystems, contributing to water filtration and habitat diversity."
