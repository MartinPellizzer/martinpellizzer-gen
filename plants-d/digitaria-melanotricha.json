    "intro": "Digitaria melanotricha, commonly known as black-haired digitaria, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a dark green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural areas but also serves as forage for livestock."
