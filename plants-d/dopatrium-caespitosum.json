It typically forms dense, mat-like clusters with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
