    "intro": "Diospyros sapotanigera, commonly known as the black sapote, is a tropical tree native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into round, yellow fruits with a thick, aromatic skin. The fruit's flesh is creamy, sweet, and similar in texture to a banana, making it a prized edible. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental and culinary value."
