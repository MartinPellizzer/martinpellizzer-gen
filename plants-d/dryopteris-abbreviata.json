    "intro": "Dryopteris abbreviata, commonly known as the barren woods fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, horizontal stems that produce new fronds from the base. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive, narrow, and often curled appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
