    "intro": "Draba verna proles virescens, commonly known as the spring whitlow, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. It is an herbaceous perennial that is relatively short-lived, with a height of no more than 10 centimeters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
