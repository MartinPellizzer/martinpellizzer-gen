    "intro": "Dryopteris sellensis, commonly known as the Sell's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, narrow fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Dryopteris sellensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
