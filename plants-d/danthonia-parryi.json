    "intro": "Danthonia parryi, commonly known as Parry's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry blades that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe. Danthonia parryi is adapted to arid conditions and is an important component of its native ecosystem."
