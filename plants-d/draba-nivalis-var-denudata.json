It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and often appear after the flowers, which is a distinguishing feature.
