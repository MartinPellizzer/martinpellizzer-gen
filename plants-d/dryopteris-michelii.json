    "intro": "Dryopteris michelii, commonly known as the Michel's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are typically divided into a series of narrow, linear segments, giving the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fibrous, contributing to its ability to spread and form dense colonies."
