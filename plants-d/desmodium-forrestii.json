    "intro": "Desmodium forrestii, commonly known as the forest desmodium, is a species of legume native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Desmodium forrestii plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
