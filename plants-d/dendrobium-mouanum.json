    "intro": "Dendrobium mouanum, commonly known as the Mouan orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a fragrant aroma, and bloom during the warmer months. Dendrobium mouanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
