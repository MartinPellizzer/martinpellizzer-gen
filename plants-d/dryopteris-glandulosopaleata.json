It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a pale, hairy underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, a typical feature of ferns. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
