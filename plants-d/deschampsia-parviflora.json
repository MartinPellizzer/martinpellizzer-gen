It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that bears small, pale florets. Deschampsia parviflora is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in stabilizing erosion-prone areas."
