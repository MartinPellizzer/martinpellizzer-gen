    "intro": "Deguelia koolgibberah, commonly known as the Koolgibberah wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of northern Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize open, disturbed areas."
