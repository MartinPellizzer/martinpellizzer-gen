    "intro": "Douglasia nivalis, commonly known as the snow Douglasia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are elliptical and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, which helps to retain moisture in its harsh habitat. Douglasia nivalis is a rare and delicate species, often found in remote mountainous areas."
