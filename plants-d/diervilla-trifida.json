    "intro": "Diervilla trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, followed by edible, three-lobed nuts enclosed in a prickly husk. Its leaves are elliptical with serrated edges, and it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. Diervilla trifida is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife."
