    "intro": "Digitaria umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shaded environments, such as under forest canopies, where it thrives in low-light conditions. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to humid climates. Due to its ability to tolerate shade, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
