It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its tuberous roots are edible and have been traditionally used in local cuisines. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
