    "intro": "Dryopteris roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima wood fern, is a species of fern native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in montane rainforests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The Roraima wood fern is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
