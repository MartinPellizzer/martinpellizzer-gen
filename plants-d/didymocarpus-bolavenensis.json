    "intro": "Didymocarpus bolavenensis, commonly known as the Bolaven mountain ebony, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Vietnam. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces woody capsules as its fruit, which contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to mountainous environments and its role in local ecosystems."
