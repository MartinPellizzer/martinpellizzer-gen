    "intro": "Dracaena nigra var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted dracaena, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Madagascar. It features long, narrow, dark green leaves with distinctive white or yellow spots along the midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
