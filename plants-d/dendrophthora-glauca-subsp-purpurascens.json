    "intro": "Dendrophthora glauca subsp. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-tinged rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and basal rosette of linear, glaucous leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white to pale purple, typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
