    "intro": "Dalbergia mossambicensis, commonly known as African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for furniture and musical instruments. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
