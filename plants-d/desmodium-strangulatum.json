    "intro": "Desmodium strangulatum, commonly known as the strangling desmodium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its growth habit often includes climbing or spreading stems, making it adaptable to various environments. Desmodium strangulatum is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
