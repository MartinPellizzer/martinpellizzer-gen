    "intro": "Dendrobium serratipetalum, commonly known as the serrated petal orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with distinctive serrated petals. It thrives in humid, warm climates with bright, indirect light. Dendrobium serratipetalum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
