    "intro": "Dendrostellera arenaria, commonly known as the sand dune bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to conserve water in arid environments. Dendrostellera arenaria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
