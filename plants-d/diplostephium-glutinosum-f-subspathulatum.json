    "intro": "Diplostephium glutinosum f. subspathulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stickyweed, is a variant of the stickyweed species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which is a distinguishing botanical feature. The plant typically grows in low, shrub-like formations, with small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. Its leaves are often glandular and may have a waxy coating, adaptations that help reduce water loss in dry environments. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
