    "intro": "Diplazium flavescens var. proliferum, commonly known as the yellow sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern genus Diplazium. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically bright yellow to green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help in the spread of the plant through vegetative reproduction. The fronds are compound, with pinnae that are narrowly lanceolate and often have a distinct midrib."
