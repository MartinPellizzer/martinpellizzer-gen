    "intro": "Digitaria masambaensis, commonly known as the Masamba grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
