    "intro": "Daemonorops calospatha, commonly known as the red-veined cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves with distinctive red veins. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
