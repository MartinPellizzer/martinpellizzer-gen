    "intro": "Diplazium semihastatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate. Diplazium semihastatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling."
