    "intro": "Dichanthelium depauperatum, commonly known as the poor grass, is a small annual grass species native to the southern United States. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, preferring sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly. Due to its low nutritional value, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
