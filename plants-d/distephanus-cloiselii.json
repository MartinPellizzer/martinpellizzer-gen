    "intro": "Distephanus cloiselii, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, yellowish-brown spines. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. Distephanus cloiselii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in arid gardens."
