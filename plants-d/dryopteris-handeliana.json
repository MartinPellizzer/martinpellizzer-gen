    "intro": "Dryopteris handeliana, commonly known as the Chinese wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its upright, tree-like fronds that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
