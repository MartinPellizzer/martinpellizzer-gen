    "intro": "Dicksonia hypolepidoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, lance-shaped fronds. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a significant component of New Zealand's ecological landscape."
