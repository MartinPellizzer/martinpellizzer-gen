    "intro": "Dolichodelphys, commonly known as the long-leafed bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their slender, thread-like leaves that often float on the water's surface. They are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Dolichodelphys species are known for their ability to trap small aquatic organisms using specialized bladder-like structures. Their botanical features make them unique among carnivorous plants, as they rely on both photosynthesis and predation for nutrient acquisition."
