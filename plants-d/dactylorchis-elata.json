    "intro": "Dactylorchis elata, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swampy areas. Dactylorchis elata is an ephemeral plant, often found in temporary wetlands where it completes its life cycle quickly."
