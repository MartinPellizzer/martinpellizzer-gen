    "intro": "Dryopteris integripinnula, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It is native to temperate regions of Asia, particularly in China, Japan, and Korea, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant features a short, upright rhizome with a dense covering of brown, hairy scales. Its fronds are typically arching, with a slender, linear shape and a smooth, glossy surface. Dryopteris integripinnula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
