    "intro": "Digitaria doellii, commonly known as the desert dropseed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the United States and Mexico. It is a grass species characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. Digitaria doellii is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soil. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
