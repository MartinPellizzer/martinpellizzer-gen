    "intro": "Drosera rotundifolia var. perennis, commonly known as the perennial sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its flowers are small and clustered, often pink or red, and bloom in late summer. This variant is known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions and can enter a dormant state during unfavorable periods."
