    "intro": "Duthiea, commonly known as the silverleaf duthiea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage, which is covered in fine, pubescent hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. Duthiea thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
