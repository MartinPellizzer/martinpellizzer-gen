    "intro": "Diplopappus umbellatus var. amygdalinus, commonly known as the sweet sarsaparilla, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind, a common trait among members of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. The variety amygdalinus is distinguished by its higher concentration of amygdalin, a compound related to bitter almonds."
