    "intro": "Duranta repens f. vestita, commonly known as the velvetleaf duranta, is a compact, trailing shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, which are followed by bright blue or purple berries. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering. Due to its compact growth habit, it is well-suited for container gardening and hanging baskets."
