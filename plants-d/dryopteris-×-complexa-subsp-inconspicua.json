    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 complexa subsp. inconspicua, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a hybrid fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
