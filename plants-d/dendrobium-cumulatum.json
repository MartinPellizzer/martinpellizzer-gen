    "intro": "Dendrobium cumulatum, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a perennial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces racemes of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in two rows along the stem. Dendrobium cumulatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
