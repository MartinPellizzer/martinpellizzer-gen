    "intro": "Dracula cutis-bufonis, commonly known as the vampire orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety leaves and its unusual, fleshy, red or purple flowers that resemble the appearance of a bat's wing. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Its unique appearance and limited distribution have made it a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to habitat destruction, Dracula cutis-bufonis is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
