    "intro": "Dryopteris aureliana, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It features a distinctive, leathery, dark green frond with a golden-yellow margin that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are typically divided into a series of lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a lush, dense appearance."
