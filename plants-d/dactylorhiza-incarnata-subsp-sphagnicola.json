    "intro": "Dactylorhiza incarnata subsp. sphagnicola, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to western Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in acidic, peaty soils found in bogs and wetlands. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with a rhizome that produces a single, leafy stem. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in a loose spike, and are adapted for pollination by insects. This subspecies is relatively rare and is often protected due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
