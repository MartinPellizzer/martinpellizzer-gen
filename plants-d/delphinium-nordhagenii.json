It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in racemes along the stem. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough texture and a distinct, often hairy appearance. Delphinium nordhagenii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a striking addition to alpine gardens."
