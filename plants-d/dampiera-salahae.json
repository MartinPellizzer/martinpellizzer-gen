    "intro": "Dampiera salahae, commonly known as the coastal dampiera, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Dampiera salahae is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local wildlife."
