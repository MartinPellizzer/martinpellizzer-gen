    "intro": "Datura metel var. flaviflora, commonly known as the yellow-flowered angel's trumpet, is a striking member of the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from pale yellow to orange in color. The plant produces egg-shaped, spiny fruits that contain toxic seeds, a trait shared with other datura species. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its foliage and flowers emit a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths."
