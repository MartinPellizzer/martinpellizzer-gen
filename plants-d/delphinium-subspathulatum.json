    "intro": "Delphinium subspathulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically narrower than those of other delphinium species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care."
