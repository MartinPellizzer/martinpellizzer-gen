    "intro": "Drymaria cordata, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features wiry, sprawling stems covered with dense, silver-gray hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are small, ovate, and also covered in fine, silvery pubescence, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry, open habitats."
