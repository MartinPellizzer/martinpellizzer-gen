    "intro": "Diplazium mickelii, commonly known as the Mickel's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium mickelii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through oxygen production."
