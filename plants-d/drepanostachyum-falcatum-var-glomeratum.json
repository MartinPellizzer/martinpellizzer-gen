    "intro": "Drepanostachyum falcatum var. glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern genus characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit. It features long, slender, arching fronds that are typically green and slightly serrated along the edges. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
