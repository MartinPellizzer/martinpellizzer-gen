    "intro": "Dipholis matudae, commonly known as the Matudae's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate. The orchid is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded areas, reflecting its epiphytic nature."
