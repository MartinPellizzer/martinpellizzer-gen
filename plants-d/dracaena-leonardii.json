    "intro": "Dracaena leonardii, commonly known as the Leonard's dracaena, is a rare and striking plant native to the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and long, narrow leaves that are typically a deep green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
