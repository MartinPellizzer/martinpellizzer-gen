    "intro": "Danthonia brachyacme, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with slender, awnless flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Danthonia brachyacme plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
