    "intro": "Dactylorhiza incarnata f. dunensis, commonly known as the Duneland orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to western Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with distinctive spurred petals. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
