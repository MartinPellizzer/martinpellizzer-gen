    "intro": "Digitaria comifera, commonly known as silverhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, Digitaria comifera is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
