    "intro": "Deyeuxia hygrometrica var. tandilensis, commonly known as the Tandil grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. This variety thrives in moist environments, such as wetlands and marshes, and is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
