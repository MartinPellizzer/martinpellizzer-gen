    "intro": "Danthonia elongata, commonly known as the slender feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in early summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in alpine or coastal areas. Danthonia elongata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
