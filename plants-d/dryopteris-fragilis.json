    "intro": "Dryopteris fragilis, commonly known as the brittle shield fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and conservation efforts."
