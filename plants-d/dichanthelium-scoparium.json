    "intro": "Dichanthelium scoparium, commonly known as the tufted sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils, often found in open habitats such as dunes, roadsides, and coastal areas. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. Dichanthelium scoparium plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
