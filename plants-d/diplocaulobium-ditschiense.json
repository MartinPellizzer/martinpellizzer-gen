It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with small, glossy leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
