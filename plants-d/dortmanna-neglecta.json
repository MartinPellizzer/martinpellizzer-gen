    "intro": "Dortmanna neglecta, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a simple structure with a thallus that consists of leaf-like structures called phyllidia and a central stem-like axis. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. Dortmanna neglecta plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat."
