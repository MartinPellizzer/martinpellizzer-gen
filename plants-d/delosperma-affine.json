    "intro": "Delosperma affine, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent perennial native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Delosperma affine is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
