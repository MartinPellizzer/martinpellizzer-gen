    "intro": "Delphinium grandiflorum var. robustum, commonly known as the tall larkspur, is a striking perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, supporting clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers. The leaves are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is particularly valued for its showy blooms and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual impact. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, thriving in cooler climates."
