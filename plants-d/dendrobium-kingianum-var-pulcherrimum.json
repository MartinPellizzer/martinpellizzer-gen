    "intro": "Dendrobium kingianum var. pulcherrimum, commonly known as the King's Dendrobium, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with fleshy, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often with a prominent lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
