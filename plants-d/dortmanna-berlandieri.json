    "intro": "Dortmanna berlandieri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The plant is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
