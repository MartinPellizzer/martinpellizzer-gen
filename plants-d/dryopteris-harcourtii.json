    "intro": "Dryopteris harcourtii, commonly known as the Harcourt's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
