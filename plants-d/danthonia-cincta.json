    "intro": "Danthonia cincta, commonly known as the narrowleaf tussock grass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Danthonia cincta produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
