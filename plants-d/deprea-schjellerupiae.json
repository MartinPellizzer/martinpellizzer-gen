    "intro": "Deprea schjellerupiae, commonly known as the Schjellerup's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers and herbaceous growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 4,000 meters. Its flowers are usually blue or violet, with five petals and a tubular throat, adapted for pollination by insects. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
