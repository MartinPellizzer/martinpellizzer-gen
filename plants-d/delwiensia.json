    "intro": "Delwiensia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with elongated, waxy leaves and striking, showy flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Delwiensia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
