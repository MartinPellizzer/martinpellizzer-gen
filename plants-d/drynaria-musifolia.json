    "intro": "Drynaria musifolia, commonly known as the \"bamboo fern,\" is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender, bamboo-like stems that are covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety scales. The plant produces feathery, bipinnate fronds that are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Drynaria musifolia is also valued for its ability to climb and form dense, lush foliage in its natural habitat."
