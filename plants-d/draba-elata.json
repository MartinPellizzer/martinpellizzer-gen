    "intro": "Draba elata, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Draba elata has a low-growing habit, with basal leaves and clusters of bright yellow or white flowers. Its small size and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it a resilient species in high-altitude ecosystems."
