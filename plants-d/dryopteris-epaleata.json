    "intro": "Dryopteris epaleata, commonly known as the silver sword fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive silvery underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to two meters, making it a striking addition to woodland gardens."
