    "intro": "Didymoglossum lenormandii, commonly known as the slender tundra moss, is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in cold, arctic and alpine environments. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow shoots and small, overlapping leaves. The plant is typically found on bare ground, rock surfaces, or in soil in polar regions and high mountain areas. It is adapted to harsh conditions with a low growth form and a thick, protective cuticle. Didymoglossum lenormandii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other Arctic flora."
