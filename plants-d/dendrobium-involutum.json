    "intro": "Dendrobium involutum, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its spiral-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium involutum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
