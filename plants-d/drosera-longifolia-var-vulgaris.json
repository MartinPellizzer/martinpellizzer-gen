    "intro": "Drosera longifolia var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It features sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that secrete a dew-like substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are usually pink or red in color, which helps attract prey. It reproduces through seeds and can also propagate vegetatively through rhizomes."
