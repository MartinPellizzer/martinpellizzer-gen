    "intro": "Diotacanthus albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered diotacanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Diotacanthaceae and is characterized by its striking white, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
