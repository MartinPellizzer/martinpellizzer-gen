    "intro": "Delphinium ajacis var. hyacinthiflorum, commonly known as the hyacinth-flowered larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of striking blue to purple flowers, which resemble hyacinths in both color and form. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
