    "intro": "Dendrobium pseudorarum var. pseudorarum, commonly known as the rare orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences bearing showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil and high light intensity for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
