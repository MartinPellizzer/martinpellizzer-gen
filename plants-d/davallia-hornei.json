    "intro": "Davallia hornei, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as under the canopy of forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. Davallia hornei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of care."
