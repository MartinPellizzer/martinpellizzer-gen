    "intro": "Dendrophthora azuensis, commonly known as the Azuensian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it produces its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Central America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
