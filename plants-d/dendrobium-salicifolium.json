    "intro": "Dendrobium salicifolium, commonly known as the willow-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, pendulous stems covered in clusters of lance-shaped leaves that resemble willow leaves, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Dendrobium salicifolium thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
