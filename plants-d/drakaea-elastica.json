    "intro": "Drakaea elastica, commonly known as the elastic hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure that resembles a small, elongated pouch. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a single flower, which is typically a deep purple or violet color. Drakaea elastica is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized pollination mechanism involving thynnid wasps. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in heathland or open forest environments."
