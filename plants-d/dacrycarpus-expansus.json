    "intro": "Dacrycarpus expansus, commonly known as the broadleaf pine, is a species of coniferous tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. The tree produces small, woody cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest ecosystems. The plant has both ecological and historical significance in New Zealand's flora."
