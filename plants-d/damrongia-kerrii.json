    "intro": "Damrongia kerrii, commonly known as the Kerri's ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a unique, almost otherworldly appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Damrongia kerrii is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of conservation interest."
