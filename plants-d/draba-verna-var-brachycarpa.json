    "intro": "Draba verna var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-seeded spring whitlow, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of basal leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, typical of the mustard family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
