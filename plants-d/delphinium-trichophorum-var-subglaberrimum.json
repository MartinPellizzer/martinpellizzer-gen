It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, though the variety subglaberrimum is noted for its reduced hairiness. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
