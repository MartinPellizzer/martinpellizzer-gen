    "intro": "Dryopteris sichotensis subsp. coreanomontana, commonly known as the Korean mountain wood fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Korea. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate with a distinctive, often recurved shape. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and extensively branched, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns."
