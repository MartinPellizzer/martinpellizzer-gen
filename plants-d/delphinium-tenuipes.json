    "intro": "Delphinium tenuipes, commonly known as the slender larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its toxicity, care should be taken to avoid ingestion by humans and animals."
