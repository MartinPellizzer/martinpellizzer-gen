    "intro": "Dichanthelium ovale, commonly known as the oval panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland and marshy areas, preferring moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, upright stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are usually green to reddish in color. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native habitat."
