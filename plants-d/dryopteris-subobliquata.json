    "intro": "Dryopteris subobliquata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings due to its attractive foliage."
