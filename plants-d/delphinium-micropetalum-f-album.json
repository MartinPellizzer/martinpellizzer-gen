    "intro": "Delphinium micropetalum f. album, commonly known as the white-flowered delphinium, is a rare and striking cultivar of the delphinium genus. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of large, showy white flowers with a distinctive blue-violet hue at the base. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of central Asia and thrives in cooler, moist environments. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its unique coloration, though it requires careful cultivation to ensure successful growth."
