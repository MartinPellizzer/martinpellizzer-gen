    "intro": "Draba lanceolata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in short inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to alpine and subalpine environments. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of high-elevation plant communities."
