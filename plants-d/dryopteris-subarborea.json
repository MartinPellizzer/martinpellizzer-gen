    "intro": "Dryopteris subarborea, commonly known as the rock fern or cliff fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often grayish-blue in color due to a dense covering of trichomes. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Dryopteris subarborea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and shaded woodland settings."
