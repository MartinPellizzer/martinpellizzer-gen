    "intro": "Delphinium rugulosum, commonly known as the roughleaf larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of spurred blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, rough hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals."
