    "intro": "Dryopteris sangnellii, commonly known as the Sangnellii wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a light green color and a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
