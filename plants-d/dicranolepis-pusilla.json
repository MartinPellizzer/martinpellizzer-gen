    "intro": "Dicranolepis pusilla, commonly known as the small moss, is a diminutive liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a short, upright stem with dense, overlapping leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature. Dicranolepis pusilla plays a vital role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
