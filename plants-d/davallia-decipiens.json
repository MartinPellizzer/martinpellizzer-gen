    "intro": "Davallia decipiens, commonly known as the false bird's nest fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with numerous roots and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Davallia decipiens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
