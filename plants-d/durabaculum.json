    "intro": "Durabaculum, commonly known as the everlasting plant, is a unique species characterized by its ability to retain its vibrant colors and structural integrity for an extended period after being harvested. This plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it has adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and extreme temperature fluctuations. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps reduce water loss and increase drought tolerance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked but play a vital role in its reproductive cycle. Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, Durabaculum is often used in horticultural displays and as a symbol of endurance in botanical studies."
