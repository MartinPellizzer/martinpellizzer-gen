    "intro": "Danthonia nervosa, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spikelet that bears small, spike-like flowers. Danthonia nervosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
