    "intro": "Dryopteris pilososquamata, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are covered in dense, hairy scales, giving it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that are often slightly curled. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a notable species within the Dryopteris genus."
