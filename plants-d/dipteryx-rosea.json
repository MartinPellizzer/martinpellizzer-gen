    "intro": "Dipteryx rosea, commonly known as the rosewood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, oval seeds. It is valued for its dense, aromatic wood, which is highly sought after in the furniture and musical instrument industries. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also listed as an endangered species in some regions."
