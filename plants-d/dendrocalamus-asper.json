It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its thick, fibrous culms that are often used in construction and handicrafts. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a rough, scaly texture on the underside, which contributes to its common name. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils.
