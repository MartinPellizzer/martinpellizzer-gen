    "intro": "Dryopteris peripae, commonly known as the Japanese Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It features a dense, compact rosette of leathery, dark green fronds that are typically shield-shaped. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fern's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
