    "intro": "Diplazium aberrans, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly branched fronds that give it a zigzag appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate-shaped pinnae that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Diplazium aberrans is widely distributed across tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands."
