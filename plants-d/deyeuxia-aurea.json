    "intro": "Deyeuxia aurea, commonly known as golden false rice, is a perennial grass species native to Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a golden hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often forming dense vegetation that can dominate these habitats. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
