    "intro": "Dyckia remotiflora var. remotiflora, commonly known as the remote-flowered dyckia, is a bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces striking, tall inflorescences with clusters of bright orange or red flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among bromeliad enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
