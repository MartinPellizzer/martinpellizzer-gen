    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 furadensis, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis. It is characterized by its robust, arching fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant forms dense, low-growing clumps and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it is often found in woodland areas. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
