    "intro": "Dryopteris pentagona, commonly known as the pentagon fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pentagonal-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a defining feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Dryopteris pentagona is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
