    "intro": "Draba microcarpella, commonly known as the dwarf whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. Draba microcarpella is a short-lived perennial, often found in high-altitude habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
