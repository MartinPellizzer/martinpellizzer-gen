    "intro": "Disperis tenera, commonly known as the African orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns. Its roots are fibrous and help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Disperis tenera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
