    "intro": "Delphinium camptocarpum var. robustum, commonly known as the robust delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, with a rough, hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a striking addition to alpine gardens."
