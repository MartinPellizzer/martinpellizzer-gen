    "intro": "Diphyes schilleriana, commonly known as the Schiller's two-leaved plant, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinct morphology, featuring two different types of leaves on the same plant\u2014diphyllous, which is a rare trait in the plant kingdom. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light for photosynthesis. Its flowers are small and clustered, often producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
