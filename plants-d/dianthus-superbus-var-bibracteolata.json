    "intro": "Dianthus superbus var. bibracteolata, commonly known as the purple campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and hardy nature. The variety bibracteolata is distinguished by its additional bract-like structures at the base of the flower clusters."
