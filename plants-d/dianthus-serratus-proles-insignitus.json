    "intro": "Dianthus serratus proles insignitus, commonly known as the Sierra dianthus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and vibrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white fuzz, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, known for its showy flowers and ecological importance to pollinators."
