    "intro": "Dorstenia amoena, commonly known as the \"Beaded Windowleaf,\" is a striking member of the Malvaceae family native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, bead-like structures along its stems and its large, heart-shaped leaves that often have a waxy, glossy appearance. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are typically hidden within the leaf axils, making them less conspicuous. Dorstenia amoena is a climbing shrub that can grow up to several meters in height, using its tendrils to support itself. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique foliage."
