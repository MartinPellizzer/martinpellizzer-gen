    "intro": "Delphinium grandiflorum f. roseolum, commonly known as the rose-leaf larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which are often tinged with pink or white. The foliage consists of deeply lobed, fern-like leaves that give the plant a delicate, ethereal appearance. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and its ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic to humans and animals."
