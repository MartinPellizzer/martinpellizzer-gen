    "intro": "Deguelia trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved senna, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal. Deguelia trifoliata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
