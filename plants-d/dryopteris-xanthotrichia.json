    "intro": "Dryopteris xanthotrichia, commonly known as the golden-haired wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that often have a golden or yellowish hue along the veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The golden-haired wood fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
